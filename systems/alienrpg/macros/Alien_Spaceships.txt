Bugs:

-General:
*Some tooltips don't show the correct text. - Fixed

-Modules/Upgrades:
*Quantity isn't saved when changed in the spaceship sheet. It works correctly when editing the item.   -   I am looking into this.  Not sure what is going on.  

Suggestions:

-General:
*Add Model if possible.  -   Not sure what you are asking? 

*Change "Crew" position with "Engineer".   -  Corrected also changed Commander to Captain.

*Comtech's modifiers are great, but they shouldn't show for Armor or Piloting rolls.   -   Oops.  Fixed.

*Defensive armaments should be rollable too. - Done.

*Weapon attack dialog could have a Range Modifier. It's very similar to Target Lock Modifier.    -   Good idea on the todo list now.

*Only "Gunners" should be able to fire weapons. But maybe it's OK as it is for smaller crews (when each person can have more than one position).  -   You are right.  I have restricted this to Gunners.

*A way to roll Space Combat Panic Roll would be great. - On the todo list.

*Damage max should be the Hull rating. -  Gonna have to have a think about this as it's tricky to do dynamically with the buttons. 


-Modules/Upgrades:   -   I assume you are talking about the Tab.  I need to rework it some more.  Overall I am not happy with the layout. 
*Modules/Upgrades could show their Capacity/Type. Seems to be plenty os space for that.

*Spacecraftmods could have an "Upgrade" type.

*Ad Hoc items could be useful here too.

-Not related to spaceship sheets: - I need to look at how computers modify rolls on starships.  For instance does a MU/TH/UR 6000 really give +5 to piloting rolls?   Same wih Ranged Combat.  
*Computer mainframes have an attributes tab. It would be great if they were rollable.
