Such direct action would invite meddling from rival gods, the conventional wisdom goes, which could quickly devolve into a deific war. Yet though the potential risks of such an act are very true, the thought that the gods are in any way barred from taking action is a lie. From Sarenrae striking a city from the face of the earth to Zon-Kuthon’s involvement with the nation of Nidal, the divine powers of Golarion have acted before to directly mark the world in countless ways since its creation. Some of these acts have been prominently recorded, and even lauded, by priests and religious scholars. Others have long been forgotten, their records lost in disasters, or their memory blotted from history by those who wish to maintain the illusion of a stable future that cannot be shattered by the whim of a malevolent god. Few know of the time when a dragon god of destruction spread his wings over the skies of Golarion. When Earthfall nearly brought about the world’s end, Dahak could not help but take note. Amid the overwhelming devastation on both physical and spiritual levels, with both continents and gods being destroyed, Dahak’s nature could not resist the pull toward the planet. Dahak explored the metaphysical boundaries separating his realm in Hell and the world of Golarion, and eventually he discovered a flaw in Huntergate, one of the <i>aiudara</i> of Alseta’s Ring. Using this flaw, Dahak was able to shift his essence through the boundaries of reality, manifesting an incredibly powerful incarnation of himself in the post-apocalyptic world. This incarnation ravaged the surrounding Mwangi Expanse—and had he caught Apsu’s attention, they likely would have triggered a godly war that would damage the already horribly wounded Golarion enough to finish the job that Earthfall started. But Dahak had taken care to limit his presence just enough to escape Apsu’s notice, and thus he was able to revel in the ruins for many years.</p><p>Golarion’s salvation came not from the gods, but from the Ekujae elves who lived in the lands around Huntergate, where Dahak’s rampage began. With their nation under siege, the Ekujae fought Dahak’s manifestation, confronting the dragon with the force and fury of every elf who was strong enough to carry a spear. The power to fight back was bought with a terrible price—the only way for their mortal weapons to wound the god’s manifestation was via a powerful ritual known as the <i>anima invocation</i>, which required the noblest of the Ekujae to willingly sacrifice themselves so that their spirits could bolster the remaining Ekujae warriors. With this powerful magic, they were able to confront Dahak’s manifestation and strike him down. Yet even defeated, Dahak’s wounds continued to heal. Unable to truly kill him, the Ekujae used their soul-empowered weaponry to cast the manifestation’s spiritual energy out of his body and back into the same flaw in Huntergate that had allowed Dahak to appear in the first place. The magic of the ritual and the power of Dahak’s manifestation overloaded the energies of Alseta’s Ring in a backlash that destroyed the way station held within Huntergate, while simultaneously trapping the manifestation in a remote dimension between <i>aiudara</i> portals. This backlash of power coursing through Alseta’s Ring also destroyed the portal to Kyonin, cutting Alseta’s Ring off from the <i>aiudara</i> network forever.</p><p>Over the next several thousand years, the Ekujae preserved this great battle in oral tradition, even as the rest of the world moved on and forgot. Dahak himself moved on as well, abandoning his manifestation in the in-between within Huntergate and leaving the physical remains of his body to slowly fossilize in the forgotten swamp in which they lay. Yet the manifestation himself did not forget, and even over the course of ages, he never relented in his efforts to escape from his prison. Though these efforts haven’t achieved their primary goal, his influence has reached out to a number of creatures over the centuries. Hundreds of cults have risen and built monuments to the dragon god in the Mwangi Jungle around Huntergate, only to be found and wiped out by the Ekujae. The half-dragon boggard Belmazog is only the latest cultist to rise to prominence in the area, and she’s formed a large cult of Dahak worshippers called the Cinderclaws. But while Belmazog has been scheming to release Dahak’s manifestation for much of her life, she never had the magical power to perform the required rituals—until now. Recently, members of a mysterious organization known as the Scarlet Triad contacted her, lending a number of powerful wizards to allow the Dahak cultist to take advantage of the influence that has infected much of the nearby jungles over the centuries.</p><p>Using an imprisoned red dragon and the fossilized remains of Dahak’s manifestation as a focus for these rituals, Belmazog strengthened Dahak’s ambient power over the land by raising a series of magical dragon pillars devoted to the deity. This power allowed Belmazog to bolster the strength of her faithful followers, who then attacked the local Ekujae clans, captured the land surrounding Huntergate, stole the magical key to that portal, and then used the key to open Huntergate in an attempt to release Dahak’s manifestation. A fresh wave of divine power infused the Cinderclaws’ dragon pillars, but the manifestation itself didn’t emerge. Frustrated, Belmazog sent some of her Cinderclaws through the portal to investigate (along with an invisible and undetected a particularly long time to complete Age of Ashes, the sack at the pillar’s base contains a thin gold bar worth consider this a sign of winning Harriet’s approval. </p><blockquote><b>Critical Success</b></blockquote><p>Once Nketiah has finished, she asks the PCs to share </p>","_id":"iDgUvqCOqfEsDU2W"}
