Alternatively, the PCs could notice this group of slavers dragging several screaming and crying townsfolk down the street toward the harbor. This encounter is meant to give the PCs a chance to both earn experience and learn a bit more about the slavers and the situation in town. If the PCs avoid the patrols, they can learn much of the information given them on page 16 by Leppin from any prisoner they rescue from the Scarlet Triad in Cypress Point.</p><p><b>Creatures</b>: A scarred Scarlet Triad thug named Ulkin Hammerfast leads this patrol of three Scarlet Triad sneaks and a single snorting blood boar—a savage beast trained by slavers to chase down escaped victims. The slavers have already captured one man, whom they’ve bound with shackles and are leading with a chain attached to a high, muzzle-like collar attached to his neck and lower face.</p><p>As soon as the patrol notices the PCs, Ulkin is quick to assess them as prime captives, and he demands they give up their weapons and surrender. The patrol doesn’t genuinely expect surrender, however, and is prepared for a fight. Once one begins, the blood boar fights to the death, but any other opponent flees if reduced to fewer than 20 Hit Points. Their captured victim cowers during the fight, too afraid to run away lest he attract the attention of the slavers or their bloodthirsty pig.</p><h4>Scarlet Triad Thug - Creature 7</h4><blockquote><h4>Scarlet Triad Sneaks (3) - CREATURE 6</h4><br>Page 8<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +12</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Blood Boar - CREATURE 6</h4><br>Page 76<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +15</blockquote><p><b>Rescuing Slaves:</b> As soon as the fight with the slavers is over, the captured victim begins crying for help through his leather and iron muzzle. His manacles and muzzle can be unlocked with keys carried by Ulkin, or with three successful DC 22 Thievery checks to Pick the Lock. This thankful victim is <b>Leppin Deesk</b>(NG male human fisher), a stout fisherman who is quick to praise the PCs as heroes for his rescue and who can quickly relate the trouble in Cypress Point. The slavers arrived in town at dawn on a ship called the <i>Genie’s Smile</i>, which is currently moored to a pier in town, and Leppin’s heard rumors that they’ve already taken the town’s leaders hostage at one of the town’s oldest and strongest structures: Nine Shields Smokehouse. Certainly no one in town was expecting the swiftness or violence of the attack—Leppin himself has seen several of his neighbors rounded up and brought to the pier, and others cut down by archers or “those enormous boars” the slavers use to chase down escapees.</p><p>What frightens Leppin the most, though, is what he’s overheard his captors talking about: they were discussing the best place to start a fire that would be most likely to burn the whole town down and—not long before the PCs arrived—had just decided to start one at a large wooden boathouse in the middle of the town’s waterfront. Leppin is rightfully worried that their strategy could well succeed, as he knows the boathouse contains a lot of old lumber. He pleads with the PCs to free the prisoners who’ve already been loaded onto the <i>Genie’s Smile</i>, make sure the boathouse is safe, and rescue the town’s leaders from the Nine Shields Smokehouse. Leppin doesn’t have any reward to offer the PCs, but he assures them that the people of Cypress Point are good-hearted folk who will show their gratitude if the PCs can save them from these slavers.</p><p><b>Questioning Slavers:</b> While the slavers fight to the death, they can be questioned if the PCs capture any of them alive. Initially hostile, a captured slaver is willing to trade information for their freedom. A successful DC 22 Diplomacy check is enough to get this information, provided the PCs promise to let the slaver go free (the slaver attempts to Sense the Motive behind such promises of freedom). If a PC promises the slaver mercy but not freedom, the PC must critically succeed to get the information. Any of the slavers can reveal that their leader (and the captain of the <i>Genie’s Smile</i>) is a brutal man named One-Eye Amnin. Further, the slavers warn the PCs that Amnin’s right-hand “man” is a slaver demon named Bullbutcher. The slavers also admit to being low-tier members of the Scarlet Triad, and that there are more members of the group active in Kintargo, but they don’t know anyone more senior than Amnin in their organization other than that the overall leader in the region is someone named “Laslunn.” A PC who succeeds at an Intimidation check to Coerce a captured slaver secures this information as well (DC 27 against Ulkin, and DC 22 against a Scarlet Triad sneak).</p>","_id":"2MQZGoxrpEhsiWhF"}

Each contains several scenes divided into Obstacles, Opportunities, and Complications that provide the GM with challenges for the PCs to overcome. Obstacles have to be overcome for the heist to proceed, Opportunities give PCs advantages in other scenes, and Complications crop up if the PCs are drawing too much attention. How well the PCs handle these scenes shapes how cleanly the group enters the compound, avoids detection, and completes the objective. If the PCs do poorly, they might encounter armed opposition or have to abandon the operation altogether. The entire heist is meant to be played out in exploration mode, but now and then you might need to shift into encounters to resolve fights or conflicts. These events are always the result of failures, as a well-planned heist can, with a bit of luck, be pulled off without a single combat.</p><p><b>Timing:</b> The PCs have a generous window in which to prepare for the heist. They can begin work on the heist at the start of Chapter 2, and must strike on the 15th. If the PCs haven’t learned of the auction by the 14th, several of Satla’s friends contact her that evening; this gives the PCs only the 15th to prepare before performing the heist. If they don’t act by then, the PCs lose their opportunity to rescue Exavisu Kerndalion and thereby earn the Jewelers’ Guild’s full support. In this case, a dejected Satla learns about some of Exavisu’s revelations regarding the Red Pyramid’s underground levels and the mysterious orb (page 30) through several recently escaped Scarlet Triad slaves—enough to provide context and keep the story moving.</p><p>Once the heist begins, the PCs move through scenes at a quicker pace, since the longer they remain in the estate, the more notice they draw. The amount of time it takes for the PCs to complete the heist depends on their tactics. A raid-like strategy could be done within 5 minutes, whereas a more measured approach might take several hours.</p><p><b>Pacing:</b> At its core, the heist is a series of skill checks, and it’s very easy to turn it into a mechanical challenge. However, try to take advantage of the tension to draw out roleplaying, problem solving, and memorable banter. The more you prompt the players to suggest solutions or skills—many of which will likely align with the heist mechanics—the more they’ll feel they own their victory.</p><p><b>Scene Structure:</b> PCs can stick together or split up for scenes, and can meet back up between them. If the group is split up, they carry out their scenes simultaneously in-world, though you might want to play them out one by one at the table. You can decide what order to play them in. Endeavor to keep each PC involved in the heist, but remember that only the PCs present for a scene can resolve it.</p><p>You control the flow of scenes, particularly Opportunities and Complications. When one PC or group draws more attention, it could cause a Complication for a different group elsewhere. Likewise, an isolated PC could be the only one who spots a new Opportunity.</p><p>If a player’s roleplaying or strategy is particularly good—particularly when adapting to a Complication—consider granting them a circumstance bonus to their next check, typically +1, as described on page 492 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>. </p><p><b>Troubleshooting:</b> There are numerous ways a heist can go sideways, but if it does, that’s okay! Ultimately, there’s no right way to run the heist, and the system is intended to provide you flexibility to manage the pace and maintain tension. Use the scenes provided here as guidelines for creating your own on the fly to accommodate the PCs’ hijinks.</p><p><b>Larger Groups:</b> For a group of more than four PCs, chose two or three scenes in Phases 3 and 4 to be harder. Increase the successes needed to complete them by one each.<h3>Heist Terms</h3>The following terminology is used in the Liberation task.</p><p><b>Awareness Points:</b> This is a value for tracking how suspicious guards and bystanders are (see Awareness on page 25). Failures and critical failures typically increase Awareness Points. When Awareness reaches certain thresholds, new Complications and dangers come into play.</p><p><b>Complication:</b> This type of scene represents an unexpected problem during the heist. It functions like an Obstacle, but the GM introduces it in addition to the current Obstacles. Typically, a Complication has to be completed before the PCs dealing with it can return to working on Obstacles.</p><p><b>Edge Point:</b> This is a special advantage granted by good planning, quick thinking, allies’ intervention, or the like. Edge Points are precious, and typically gained by pursing Opportunities. When a PC fails at a scene, they can spend an Edge Point to succeed instead (even if they critically failed). Some Edge Points can be used only on certain tasks, and once used the Edge Point is lost. Consider using tokens or other physical objects at the table to represent the party’s Edge Points.</p><p><b>Obstacle:</b> This is a scene that the PCs need to overcome or bypass to achieve their objectives.</p><p><b>Opportunity:</b> This is a scene that the PCs have the option to perform, but that’s not required for final success. Completing an Opportunity provides an advantage, often an Edge Point.</p><p><b>Overcome:</b> This part of an activity’s stat block lists skill checks or other strategies PCs might use to resolve a scene. If the activity requires multiple successes to overcome it, that is listed here as well. Make the final determination on what strategies might work, based on what makes sense within the story, adding additional options as you wish. Resolving a scene should generally involve skill checks, expending resources (such as money, spells, or magic items), or exceptionally clever tactics. If a PC’s spell, item, or other ability could resolve a scene (such as using a multi-target confusion effect to scatter guards), use +25 as the default saving throw bonus.</p>","_id":"2bqVYasGhtzFeuba"}

The temple once also had numerous outbuildings, such as a kitchen, baths, stables, and event spaces, but these structures were destroyed during Veshumirix’s conquest of Saggorak. Unless otherwise noted, there are no light sources within the Temple of All Gods, and ceiling height averages at 20 feet.</p>","_id":"5JY3P1CwuqJNaJxm"}

With their attentions increasingly focused elsewhere, the Scarlet Triad is forced to let go of its ambitions in the region, at least for the short term, but the organization increasingly turns to the emerging threat posed by the PCs. At your option, any significant agents of the Triad who survived this adventure may well show up later, and they may have an axe to grind with the PCs who defeated them before—make sure to increase their levels a bit to model the fact that they’ve been training and planning for their revenge against the party.</p><p>Securing the <i>Eye of the Wise</i> is all that’s really needed to progress on to the next adventure in the Age of Ashes Adventure Path, but for the moment, the PCs should be given a chance to rest, relax, and catch their breath.

For their aid in helping to defeat the slavers and rescuing her friends, she’s been given permission to offer a magic item to each PC. Each PC should be given a single item of 9th level or lower of your choice as a reward—see the Adventure Toolbox for details on a few items unique to the Bellflower Network that could make for excellent rewards.

A suit of <i>+1 resilient shadow armor</i> might be a good choice, as would a<i> +1 axiomatic</i> or<i> grievous weapon</i> or any wand of a 5th-level shadow-themed or illusion spell.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> You should also award the PCs additional XP for their good work in this adventure at this point—an award of 80 XP should do the trick, but you can increase this award as you see fit so that the characters get enough XP to reach 12th level—they’ll need all the experience they can get if they’re to endure the dangers that will face them soon amid the “Fires of the Haunted City”!</p>","_id":"6fakcyzsgO2v4kRG"}

At this point, a worried representative of the guild the PCs most recently convinced to stand against the Scarlet Triad (referred to here simply as “The Guild”) delivers a message to the PCs, both requesting help and implicitly accusing them of bringing misfortune upon that guild. Once this letter arrives, the PCs have 4 days in which to seek a cure before that guild’s master expires from the poison.</p><p>The Guild continues its business as usual as though nothing were the matter, but if the PCs ask to meet with the guildmaster, several professionals lead the PCs to meet with their leader while insisting this is the PCs’ fault and scolding them for getting involved with the Scarlet Triad. The guildmaster is very ill from the poison, suffering intermittent hallucinations, and is being attended to by a stern woman known as <b>DoctorRemie</b> (N female halfling physician). The guildmaster is in the middle of a waking nightmare when the PCs arrive, shortly after which they regain their senses and can speak. </p><p>The guildmaster can convey how they first fell ill earlier that day and hadn’t done anything particularly out of the ordinary that might have exposed them to disease or toxins. Their dinner the previous night consisted of djamet, a stew of chicken, tomatoes, onion, and strong spices, served with salted flatbread. They slept poorly and awoke suddenly from a nightmare in which a dragon had set the bedroom on fire. Nightmares since have consistently involved deserts, heat shimmers, fire, and dangerous beasts.</p><p>Doctor Remie hasn’t managed to identify the condition’s cause, and while she has been treating the symptoms as best she can, the poison’s potency is beyond her skill to effectively combat. She can describe what the guildmaster has experienced over the last few hours, and at this point she’s desperate enough to agree to let any PC who seems capable of handling poison try to cure or at least treat the guildmaster’s affliction. With a successful DC 38 Medicine check, a PC can Treat the Poison, extending the guild leader’s life by 1 day. A PC can attempt this check once per day to buy more time to create a cure, but if the guildmaster goes 4 days without treatment, they perish. A successful DC 32 Medicine check allows a PC to measure key vital signs and procure small samples that confirm the affliction is a poison of unknown type, it’s slow-acting yet deadly, and it will be extremely difficult for the guildmaster to recover without a cure; on a critical success, the PC also notes traces of nightmare vapor, indicating that this more common toxin may have been used as a base for whatever exceptionally potent poison afflicts the guildmaster.</p><p>This information provides the PCs an edge in the investigation that follows. <i>Detect poison</i> heightened to 2nd level can identify that the guildmaster is suffering from an ingested poison but won’t reveal its exact nature other than to also detect the presence of nightmare vapor in the victim. Since nightmare salt is an 18th-level poison, <i>neutralize poison</i> must be heightened to have a chance of curing it. If the PCs manage to cure the guildmaster of the effects of nightmare salt, the guildmaster remains weak for a short time but suggests it would be wise to continue the charade of illness. After all, the poisoner is still out there, and if word spreads that the guildmaster has recovered, the poisoner might strike again; curing the guildmaster buys the PCs much more time but doesn’t remove the threat.</p><p>If the PCs don’t decide to seek out experts on their own, Remie recommends they contact the Poison Makers’ Guild for assistance.</p><p>The PCs can interview the guild’s kitchen staff, contractors who arrive to prepare the afternoon and evening meals.

Kite flying is popular here due to the prevalence of ocean breezes, a tradition the Bellflower Network has encouraged for their own subtle gain. As the kites flown high on Kite Hill are visible from nearly anywhere in Kintargo, Bellflower agents can deliver secret messages across the city with a coded combination of kite colors and specific movements. The lead Bellflower agent in the city of Kintargo, a halfling who has taken the name of the folk hero Nolly Peltry as her own pseudonym (page 80), frequently offers free kites to maintain public interest and to cover her own communications. She always takes care to hold back kites of specific colors and shapes that are to be used only for Bellflower communications, and today—a sunny day with perfect winds—Nolly has brought several particularly colorful kites as a public protest against the Nidalese diplomats, whom many citizens see as joyless and drab.</p><p>When the PCs arrive, nearly a hundred people of all ages and ancestries are enjoying the day or flying kites. Some speak out against Nidal and the doom that awaits Kintargo for allying with the shadowy nation, to general murmurs of agreement. When the PCs arrive in the area, they see no obvious evidence of either Scarlet Triad agents or Bellflower operatives among the crowd—to all appearances, this is just another day on Kite Hill.A stall with a sign that reads “FREE KITES” does brisk business handing out homemade kites to anyone who wants to try their hand. A middle-aged halfling woman operates the stall and boasts about how she’s made each kite herself. This is Nolly Peltry—an infamous folk hero associated with the Bellflower Network—though she doesn’t use that name when interacting with ordinary customers, lest her association with the Bellflower Network blow Kite Hill’s cover. This adventure assumes that the PCs accompany Hundy, who can introduce the PCs to Nolly, but if the PCs come here on their own, it shouldn’t be long before Nolly takes note of them, her keen eye picking them out among the common folk in the crowd. In either case, she waves the PCs (and Hundy, whom she makes no initial indication that she recognizes) over to her stall—read or paraphrase the following.</p><blockquote>“You lot look like you could do with some kite flying!” says the halfling proprietor of the makeshift stall. With a cheerful voice she asks, “Which one strikes your fancy?” and she gestures to the many kites hanging around the simple frame of the stall. “I’ve a few butterflies left, and a couple of boxes, and plenty of classic diamonds. I have orange, chartreuse, crimson, violet, coral, yellow—pick any! They’re free! Help us protest against the drab Nidalese diplomats infiltrating our beloved Kintargo by showing them all the colors the sky can hold! I can help you make your choice and get you up and flying, if you’ve never flown before!”</blockquote><p>Once the PCs are at her stall and begin the process of selecting kites and assembling them for flight, Nolly lowers her voice and leans in closer. “Name’s Nolly. You’re heroes for saving Hundy. He’s a brave man and a good friend. I’ve heard rumors of the Scarlet Triad, but they’ve been devilishly difficult to pin down. Knowing what you’ve learned about them is enough for me—we’ve got to get the word out about them so the Network can be ready!” She hands over a set of red diamond kites and purple box kites and then explains the plan.</p><blockquote>“We use kites to send messages sometimes, since the whole city can see them on a clear day like today. Of course, fine details aren’t something you can convey with kites, but we can get enough of a warning out like this. We’ll put up a combination of red triangular kites to represent this Scarlet Triad, and use some purple box kites to represent the Bellflower Network’s safe houses. Once they’re in the air, we’ll need to guide the red kites to smash into the purple ones. Anyone in the Network won’t realize at first who the red kites are meant to represent, but they’ll all know that our safe houses in Kintargo are in danger as the purple box kites get ‘attacked’ time and time again. Our agents know to scatter and hide, and hopefully we’ll then be able to deal with these Scarlet Triad villains.”</blockquote><p>Nolly assumes the PCs help send her message. If they object, she frowns and chides them by saying, “No good at flying kites? Or not one for giving warnings?” However, Nolly doesn’t push them further; she can gather other friends to fly the kites, but doing so leaves the PCs on their own in the next encounter.</p>","_id":"9DLDOUH7zqgsPKw3"}

At first, nothing seemed amiss—after all, members of the Court of Regents have permission to travel down to the vaults and take out items on loan for short periods, so long as they confirm their loan once a month. However, the vault guard has reported that the <i>runestone</i> has been gone for five weeks. When Irontemper went to check the logbook for a record of who had the <i>runestone</i>, she found that the book was missing several pages, right around the time that this <i>runestone</i> would have been checked out. What Irontemper had initially suspected was a simple case of a regent falling behind on their paperwork suddenly became much more suspicious.</p><p>The particulars of this situation make it politically difficult for Irontemper to investigate. Only regents are allowed to enter the vaults. The vault’s guards are inevitables, and are not particularly subject to bribes or coercion. This means that either a regent was involved in this suspicious disappearance, or someone has found a way to break into the vault without a regent’s sigil. These badges of office are also the only keys to the vault. In the first case, with another regent involved, Irontemper needs a neutral party to investigate to avoid accusations of bias or a cover-up on her part. In the second case, this disappearance has revealed a critical flaw in the vault’s security, and it would not be appropriate for Irontemper to be in charge of investigating the deficits in her own protections. Either way, Irontemper wants the PCs to take over the investigation. She suggests that they start by talking to the vault’s guards. She introduces the PCs to the kolyarut in charge of security, Esteldring, before stepping away to let the PCs conduct their investigation.</p><p><b>What Really Happened:</b> The thief was a member of the Scarlet Triad, a human woman named Thea, aided in secret by one of the regents, Mountainheart Chiselrock. Chiselrock lent Thea his regent’s sigil, allowing her to safely enter the vault. He told her about the vault’s layout, its guardians, and Esteldring’s logbook. Thea disguised herself as Fortunate Kord to further deceive the inevitable. To throw additional suspicion on Fortunate Kord, later that night, Thea broke into Fortunate Kord’s house and swapped her regent’s sigil for the one that had previously belonged to Chiselrock. She performed this final swap because of a misunderstanding of Esteldring’s abilities—she knew that kolyaruts have some magical ability to track missing objects, and that <i>antimagic armor runes</i>are notoriously difficult to affect with magic. However, she was unaware of the limitations of <i>discern location</i>, and she believed that the kolyarut’s magic would allow them to track down the specific sigil used to open the vault on that day. Finally, Thea returned a few weeks later and stole the relevant pages from the logbook to create the appearance of a cover-up.</p><p><b>Speaking to the Guardian:</b> The kolyarut aeon in charge of security, Esteldring, is concerned about the disappearance, but not because it is a mystery. They tell the PCs that they recall who checked out the item: Fortunate Algera Kord. Esteldring understands that Irontemper needs to hire impartial outsiders to continue the investigation. If the PCs express doubt in Esteldring’s assessment that Fortunate Kord was the one who came to the vaults, the inevitable explains that the vaults are specially keyed so that no one may enter without pressing one of the ten regent’s sigils to the entrance. Esteldring confirms what the PCs may already know, that the regent’s sigils are heavy medallions that serve as badges of office, which the regents wear on all official business. </p><p>If the PCs inspect the logbook, they find it is a dull document, but the methodical nature of the logs makes it easy to identify that the missing pages date two months back.</p><p>Esteldring has always been suspicious of the Gamblers’ Guild representative. They cannot comprehend why the Gamblers’ Guild is allowed to exist. For this reason, they do not consider the possibility that another member of the Court of Regents could be responsible. However, the PCs may be able to uncover that the inevitable’s case is not as airtight as they believe it to be. In the course of their conversation with the PCs, Esteldring should reveal the following information as it becomes relevant.</p><li> The ten regent’s sigils are identical, barring minor wear and tear over the centuries.</li><li>In addition to being the only keys to the vault, the sigils are also the only keys to the private offices off of the main Court Chamber. As such, if someone stole a sigil, the theft would have been noticed within a day of its disappearance.</li><li> None of the regents reported misplacing or losing their sigil.</li><li>Fortunate Kord does not often check out items from the vault. Her last borrowed item was an antique tapestry over a decade ago. She has never been late in returning a borrowed item before.</li><li>Fortunate Kord came to the vaults to check out the item after work hours. No other regents were in the building at the time.</li><li> Esteldring is capable of using <i>discern location</i>once per day. They have already used it to try to locate the <i>runestone</i>, without success. Esteldring suspects (correctly) that this failure is due to the rune’s inherent resistance to magic. Esteldring offers to use the spell at the PCs’ direction to assist with their investigations. However, since the inevitable did not touch the regent’s sigil that Thea used on that day, they cannot use the spell to prove that the sigil was indeed Fortunate Kord’s.</li><p><b>Investigating Fortunate Kord:</b> At some point during the investigation, the PCs should seek an interview with Fortunate Kord. The best place to find her is at the Whims of Fortune, a casino in the Traveler’s Quarter of Kovlar, and coincidently a place that supports her alibi—a group of customers at one of the tables at the Whims of Fortune are regulars who saw her there that night. They recall that night among snorting laughter—a young dwarven man attempted to cheat the casino to win money to impress his date, only to be physically thrown out of the establishment by Kord, who threw a barrel of garbage at him as he ran off for good measure. </p><p>If the PCs ask Fortunate Kord about the case, she sighs and shakes her head. She explains that she’s used to facing suspicion and accusations, as many of Kovlar’s people can be somewhat narrow minded. However, since it is an unofficial policy of the city to blame the Gamblers’ Guild for any suspicious or potentially criminal activity, she is very interested in learning what she can from the PCs to solve the case. If the PCs tell her which night she supposedly checked out the <i>runestone</i>, she grits her teeth in frustration. At this point, beyond telling the PCs that this issue has become personal for her and she will see to it that the perpetrator doesn’t get away with this crime, she shuts down the conversation.</p><p>If the PCs have previously secured Kord’s trust, she’ll take a deep breath and continue to speak with them—otherwise, the PCs must make a successful DC 32 Diplomacy check to Request her cooperation or a successful DC 32 Intimidation check to Coerce her into helping. She then informs the PCs that her home was broken into on the night in question, and several items were stolen. Among these stolen items was a ruby and sapphire ring that had belonged to her grandmother. She had not seen any signs that her other possessions were tampered with; specifically, the regent’s sigil was in her lockbox when she checked for it. Still, she fears that the two incidents may be connected. Thus far, only a few of her most trusted friends know of the theft—after all, if it were to become public knowledge, it would be an embarrassment.</p><p><b>Hidden Forge Clues:</b> If the PCs learn about the theft and Kord’s alibi, they earn a Hidden Forge clue.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b> If the PCs establish Fortunate Kord’s alibi, learn about the break-in, and propose an alternative theory to explain the situation, Goldhand Irontemper is impressed with their initiative. She rewards the PCs with a <i>dwarven thrower</i>, and she promises to keep the PCs in the loop with the continued investigation.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> For proving Fortunate Kord’s innocence, grant the PCs 60 XP.</p>","_id":"BE78rZS2TIbo729B"}

Specifically, the Guild has been accused of deliberately selling inferior-quality merchandise that looks great but breaks after sustained exposure to real battle. This gravest of insults is hurting the Guild’s business, and the Forgemaster wants the situation resolved quickly. If the PCs agree to help, they are called in to the House of Oaths to inspect the merchandise.</p><p>The House of Oaths is the local temple of Kols the Oathkeeper, dwarven god of duty. When the party inspects the merchandise—an assortment of martial weapons—a PC can attempt a DC 30 Crafting check or a DC 35 Perception check to perform a thorough inspection. On a success, the PC notices subtly hidden flaws in the weapons’ construction. On a critical success, they notice that although the weapons bear the maker’s marks of different smiths, their crafting style is suspiciously similar, suggesting they were in fact all made by the same smith.</p><p>If the PCs point out these issues, the Forgemaster apologizes to the merchants, refunds them the cost of their purchases, and asks the PCs to help her sniff out the source of the problem. Otherwise, after a heated argument, the Forgemaster inspects the weapons personally. She detects the flaws and makes the same promises of reimbursement, but she does not involve the PCs in any further investigation into the issue.</p><p>Halrig knows that whoever is responsible for the shoddy weapons has avoided her detection thus far. Before knowledge of the results of the investigation spread around, she wants the PCs to figure out who within the Anvillers’ Guild is responsible. </p><p><b>The Truth:</b> The person responsible for the shoddy work causing the problems in the first place is a smith named Brigven. Despite decades of practice, Brigven proved unable to pass the official smithing exams to become a full member of the Anvillers’ Guild. Filled with bitterness and shame, he was a ripe target for the cult of Droskar that has long operated in the city’s shadows. Their assurances that he could become rich and respected by honing his guile and profiting off the work of others appealed to him. For a while, Brigven managed to skirt by, selling his products at a discount to those who would otherwise struggle to afford them as long as they promised him that if they were ever able to afford a weapon rune, they’d return the weapon to him to apply the rune. On the rare occasions when someone did return to have a rune placed on a weapon, he performed the service privately, secretly replacing the defective weapon with a weapon of high enough quality to hold the rune and altering its appearance to match. However, his business has been booming of late, so he has had to acquire more high-quality weapons. In the dead of night, he has been forging cheap weapons to replace the work of other members of the Anvillers’ Guild, then trading out these copies for the real weapons.</p><p><b>Investigating the Guild:</b> The tactics by which the PCs choose to investigate the shoddy work is up to them—if the PCs are at a loss for ideas, Forgemaster Halrig suggests that they pose as merchants, and promises to refund them for any purchases they make that they do not wish to keep—doing so requires the PCs to use the Deception skill. Other skills could work just as well, provided the PCs justify the choice with the nature of their investigation.</p><blockquote><h4>Guild Investigation</h4><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">CONCENTRATE</span><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">EXPLORATION</span><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">SECRET</span><br>A PC spends a day and attempts a DC 30 Skill check to pursue their investigation into the guild.<br><b>Critical Success</b> The PCs’ investigation results in compelling evidence that Brigven is the culprit behind the shoddy weapons, and reveals the location of his shop to the PCs. This evidence forces Brigven to give up as soon as the PCs confront him in his shop without forcing them to talk him into a confession.<br><b>Success</b> The investigation implies that Brigven is behind the shoddy weapons, and reveals the location of his shop to the PCs.<br><b>Failure</b> The investigation yields no results, but does not alert Brigven of the threat.<br><b>Critical Failure</b> The investigation yields no results, and Brigven learns that the PCs are on to him. He abandons his shop and flees to the Hidden Forge to seek shelter with the other Droskar cultists. In this case, the PCs can encounter Brigven in area <b>D2</b>—you can represent him with the statistics for Thea in that encounter (page 31).</blockquote><p><b>Visiting Brigven’s Shop:</b> Upon learning of Brigven’s involvement, the PCs can visit his workshop. Here, they find displays of weapons, armor, and other supplies that superficially appear to be of high quality, but are actually forgeries bearing the same shabby flaws as the weapons infesting the guild. If Brigven fled his shop, he leaves the place unlocked and abandoned, and the PCs can use the evidence left behind to exonerate the Anvillers’ Guild.</p><p>If Brigven is in his shop and the PCs confront him with evidence of his crimes, he claims innocence, saying he’s being set up by agents in the Anvillers’ Guild unless the PCs have compelling evidence, in which case he caves. Otherwise, the PCs can convince him to confess with a successful DC 30 Diplomacy check to Request his confession, or a DC 32 Intimidate check to Coerce him into confessing.If Brigven confesses, he attempts to bargain with the PCs, offering information on greater plots he claims to be privy to in return for mercy. He fears Droskar’s wrath too much to reveal the location of the Hidden Forge directly, but he does tell the PCs that agents of Droskar are active within Kovlar and are working to bring the city to its knees, led by a terrifying woman named Ilssrah Embermead. He spins a false tale of being blackmailed. His Deception bonus is +26; if the PCs see through this lie, he stammers and sputters and finally admits that he joined the cult to make money.<b>Treasure:</b> With the knowledge that Brigven was responsible, Forgemaster Kalrig has a path forward. To reward the PCs, she teaches them the recipes for a pair of weapon runes: a <i>kin-warding rune</i> and <i>greater bloodbane rune</i> (see page 73). If the PCs also secure Brigven’s confession and capture him alive (whether they find him here or later in the Hidden Forge), Halrig offers to enhance one of the PCs’ weapons into a <i>+2 greater striking weapon</i> for free.</p><p><b>Hidden Forge Clues:</b> If the PCs get Brigven to confess, they earn two Hidden Forge clues. If he’s already fled to the Hidden Forge, they can earn only one Hidden Forge clue by searching his shop.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs discover the flaws in the weapons in the House of Oaths, they earn 40 XP. If they also trace the shoddy weapons back to Brigven, they earn another 40 XP.</p>","_id":"Bi4BiaSxWVhSs2v4"}

As a result, attempts to Gather Information about the Scarlet Triad take much longer than normal, requiring a full day of downtime per attempt. Uncovering information about the Scarlet Triad requires a successful DC 35 check—on a critical success, a PC learns two pieces of information. You can choose an appropriate piece of information for the line of questioning from the list below, or randomly determine what information they discover.</p><p><b>Aspis Consortium:</b> The Aspis Consortium has worked with the Scarlet Triad behind the scenes, even supplying mercenaries to defend key initiatives. However, the Consortium’s representative, a shaitan genie named Ytrim Azas, increasingly distrusts the Scarlet Triad’s spokesperson, Jelek Jaziman. If enough of a wedge were driven between them—or if Ytrim were convinced that the Scarlet Triad were a lost cause—the Consortium might abandon the Scarlet Triad in Katapesh.</p><p><b>Auction Date:</b> The PCs learn of the Scarlet Triad’s upcoming party and auction (see Task 1: Liberation on page 21).</p><p><b>Farmers’ Union:</b> The Farmer’s Union has had a distasteful protection racket forced on it by the Scarlet Triad. Farmers carting in their harvests—particularly on Firedays, when the grocer stalls are especially busy—speak in hushed tones about how little profit they’ve made after paying off the Scarlet Triad, and how they doubt the group would even lift a finger if anything truly threatening attacked. A few even hazard that the only thing keeping the Scarlet Triad from robbing farmers outright is that they’re already doing so legally. As this chapter begins, news also spreads of strange and frightening fire-breathing monsters that begin attacking farmer caravans to the northwest, further threatening the Farmers’ Union. Despite being paid to protect these shipments, the Scarlet Triad has done nothing, infuriating union leaders. This information allows the PCs to begin Task 2: Caravan Troubles (page 30).</p><p><b>Fleshmongers’ Federation:</b> Although the Scarlet Triad has cooperated with the Fleshmongers’ Federation to knock out competitors and quietly fix prices in the slave trade, rumor holds that the Fleshmongers are eager and ready for the chance to turn the tables on the Scarlet Triad.</p><p><b>Fraternal Order of the Anvil:</b> Eminent metallurgist Mekrem Oagli recently fell into bankruptcy following poor business and his expulsion from the Fraternal Order of the Anvil. Some believe his downfall was engineered by the Scarlet Triad for nefarious purposes. Mekrem is now living on the streets with his daughter. This knowledge allows the PCs to begin Task 5: Metals and Malice (page 38).</p><p><b>Gladiators’ Guild:</b> The Gladiators’ Guild is among the Scarlet Triad’s staunchest allies—no wonder, considering the Scarlet Triad engineered the overthrow of the former guildmaster and installation of a new, subservient leader, Bshez “Sand Claws” Shak. She has hosted increasingly deadly battles that distract viewers from the Scarlet Triad’s exploitation and have killed off several rivals within the Gladiators’ Guild. It is possible that a powerful and popular gladiator could challenge and overthrow Bshez, thus taking over the guild. Arena events occur every Toilday and Sunday. This knowledge allows the PCs to begin Task 3: Blood on the Sand (page 32).</p><p><b>Imperial Union of Breeders:</b> For more than a year, the Imperial Union of Breeders has tried to capture a magnificent wild camel known as Duneshadow. The guildmaster, Aldane Zulran, is especially interested and might offer a boon to anyone who brings him the beautiful animal alive and unharmed. This knowledge allows the PCs to begin Task 4: Romancing the Camel (page 35).</p><p><b>League of Peshmongers:</b> A bumper crop of pesh has threatened to flood the market and drive down prices, but the League of Peshmongers has attempted to restrict supply artificially. The Pactmasters seem displeased by this maneuver and have warned of consequences if the League doesn’t abandon this strategy. This information provides the PCs more context for the events in Task 6: Unseen Approval (page 42).</p>","_id":"C0hUksIaIuPgxdAH"}

It’s now owned by the Scarlet Triad, which assumed control in 4712 as repayment for the previous owner’s debts. The estate consists of a carriage house, kitchen, servant’s quarters, well-watered gardens, and a manor—the last of which includes a ballroom, dining room, bedrooms, a variety of salons, and bathrooms. Numerous rooms have especially heavy doors, reinforced windows, magical wards, and the like to ensure security and privacy. An 8-foot-high wall of cut stone blocks surrounds the estate.</p><p>Most days, the Scarlet Triad uses the estate to host influential visitors or hold meetings. The evening of the auction, the estate is abuzz with nearly 100 different visitors, servants, and auction staff. Slaves going up for bid at the auction include Exavisu Kerndallion and her three assistants, who are secretly transported into the manor from their cells under the Red Pyramid on the night of the auction—15 Neth.</p><p>Much of the evening’s entertainment takes place in the gardens outside, where caterers bring in more food and drink throughout the evening, and performers play a variety of elegant tunes. Guards stand at the major entrances and patrol the walls on either side, and guard dogs are vigilant for trespassers. The event is an elitist soiree, moving inside to the ballroom later in the evening as the auction begins. The many supernatural creatures in attendance include some who can see through magical tricks, and the estate includes numerous wards that limit the degree to which thieves can simply teleport in and out (see the Dimensional Interference Complication on page 26).<h3>Noteworthy NPCs</h3>The Scarlet Triad has invited many of Katapesh’s wealthier clientele to the auction, as well as an assortment of local allies. There are also a host of extraplanar beings in attendance, mostly from the elemental planes and Hell. <b>Jelek Jaziman</b> (NE male half-elf) is the Scarlet Triad’s ranking representative and the event’s host. The wiry, half-Garundi entrepreneur considers himself a rising star in Katapesh and likes to throw his influence around to prove it. <b>Ytrim Azas</b> (LE female shaitan) represents the Aspis Consortium, a powerful trade group with few scruples. The Consortium has worked closely with the Scarlet Triad several times over the past few years, and Ytrim is the official liaison for those deals. She considers Jelek pompous but largely reliable, and she enjoys discussing old architecture, rare jewelry, and tales of betrayal. Representing the Fleshmonger Federation is <b>Sehtba al-Izora</b> (LE female human), a Keleshite woman whose outward kindness belies her remorseless strategic approach to business.</p><p>Among the noteworthy buyers are <b>Reloon</b> (LE female raja rakshasa), <b>Altshal Gha</b> (LE male efreeti), and <b>Tersious Vind</b> (NE male tiefling). Reloon uses her ability to change shape to masquerade as Baroness Epminia Fahlspar, a Taldan noblewoman supposedly here as part of a year-long Inner Sea tour to acquire unusual treasures. She’s maintained her disguise fairly effectively so far, and anything that reveals her true buzzard-headed form causes a scene. Muscular and boasting a broad rack of horns, Altshal Gha owns dozens of mines across the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire. He arrogantly demeans anyone he doesn’t consider strategically worthwhile. He’s also the primary bidder for Exavisu, believing her jeweling talents could be an excellent addition to his business. Tersious Vind is a successful adventurer expelled from the Pathfinder Society 6 years ago after betraying his comrades and stealing their savings—a story he thinks makes him sound charming and clever. He’s here to acquire several slaves to act as his minions in his next big treasure hunt.<h3>Awareness</h3>Starting in Phase 2, if the PCs fail checks, cause disruptions, or misstep in ways that attract unwanted attention, Awareness of them increases. Awareness Points begin at 0 and increase in two ways.</p><p>•When a PC fails a check when trying to complete a scene, increase the PCs’ Awareness Points by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). Other failed checks made as part of a scene don’t increase Awareness, only ones that would have counted toward overcoming it.</p><p>•Awareness Points go up by 1 at the end of each scene, as the passage of time makes it more likely the PCs will be discovered. If multiple scenes are happening simultaneously, Awareness does not go up until all those scenes are finished.</p><p>When the PCs reach the following amounts of Awareness Points, they face greater challenges.</p><p><b>5 Awareness Points:</b> Rising suspicions cause the Scarlet Triad to call in more guards and be more vigilant. Increase the DCs of checks to overcome scenes by 1 as long as Awareness is 5 or higher. The first time the PCs reach 5 Awareness Points, a general Complication (page 26) occurs after the scene.</p><p><b>10 Awareness Points:</b> Greater wariness means there are more ways for things to go wrong. The first time the PCs reach 10 Awareness Points, a general Complication (page 26) occurs after the scene.</p><p><b>15 Awareness Points:</b> The first time the PCs reach 15 Awareness Points, a pair of Scarlet Triad enforcers (page 41) confront the PCs; use the Katapesh Streets map on page 40, the Manor Rooms map on page 23, or the Basement Rooms map on page 24 as needed to play out the fight. Increase the DC of checks to overcome scenes by 2 as long as Awareness is 15 or higher (this includes the increase from Awareness 5).</p><p><b>20 Awareness Points:</b> The first time the PCs reach 20 Awareness Points, a Scarlet Triad mage (page 57) leading a group of three calikangs (page 84) confronts them.</p><p><b>25 Awareness Points:</b> The jig is up! Waves of Scarlet Triad guards are in pursuit of the PCs, and barring some extraordinary plan, the PCs must abandon the heist or face overwhelming odds. Exavisu is moved back to the Red Pyramid and kept imprisoned there in area <b>C19</b> until the PCs can rescue her via more traditional methods during Chapter 3. <h3>Running the Infiltration</h3>During Phase 2: Infiltration, the PCs’ goal is to reach the manor without arousing suspicion. To get in, each PC needs to overcome at least two Obstacles, with a critical success giving two successes. The GM decides, based on each PC’s approach, whether that PC must gain all their successes from one Obstacle or not, and whether they can succeed multiple times against the same Obstacle. Someone who has made it in before their compatriots can pursue Opportunities. Once all PCs have the requisite successes, they have all infiltrated the estate and can move to Phase 3.<h3>General Complications</h3>These Complications can work in many different phases and locations during the heist.</p><blockquote><h4>Dimensional Interference</h4><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">EXPLORATION</span><br><b>Trigger</b> The PCs attempt to use a teleportation effect.<br><b>Overcome</b> 2 successes; DC 35 Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or ReligionSome of the protective wards in Bhetshamtal Estate provide magical static that causes teleportation effects to fail. If the PCs intend to just teleport away to safety, they need to disable these wards. This Complication is unlikely to arise until the PCs try to teleport and fail.</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Do I Know You?</h4><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">EXPLORATION</span><br><b>Trigger</b> Awareness reaches 5 or 10.<br><b>Overcome</b> DC 30 Deception, DC 35 Diplomacy, DC 28 Performance, DC 32 StealthA partygoer or worker thinks they recognize one of the PCs, attracting unwanted attention.

Expecting trouble, the Steel Falcons have weapons drawn and are poised to attack. To overcome this encounter, the PCs quickly talk down the Andoren operatives.<br><b>Failure</b> The Steel Falcons become more vocal and threatening, and a brief fight breaks out. This increases the Awareness Point total by 3 (instead of the normal 1 for a failure).<br><b>Critical Failure</b> As failure, but increase Awareness by 5.</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Unexpected Patrol</h4><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">EXPLORATION</span><br><b>Trigger</b> Awareness reaches 6 or 10.<br><b>Overcome</b> 2 successes; DC 37 Deception, DC 37 Perception, DC 35 StealthThe PCs notice a group of guards on patrol that’s only seconds away from stumbling upon them.

Exavisu Kerndallion thanks the PCs and directs them to nearby friends who can cover their trail and get her back to the Jewelers’ Guild. Depending on how cleanly the PCs performed the heist, the auction might get underway only to come to an embarrassing end once Jelek Jaziman realizes that most of those being auctioned are missing.</p><p>By the next day, Exavisu convenes with her relieved guild colleagues and begins a whisper campaign to spread word of the Scarlet Triad’s misdeeds—but quietly enough not to make her a target for further attacks. She contacts the PCs to arrange a meeting as soon as they’re available. Once they arrive, the PCs are welcomed to a cool meeting room holding refreshments, Exavisu, and four of her senior colleagues. She thanks the PCs for the rescue, rewarding them with several of the guild’s finest gems (see Treasure below). With that resolved, she explains what she experienced in captivity.</p><blockquote>“When Uri—Uri Zandivar, head of the Scarlet Triad—came to me wanting my best jewelers to immediately begin work on a secret project off-site that he wouldn’t explain, I refused; I wasn’t subjecting my people to ambiguous work orders. He didn’t take it well, but I considered the matter closed. A week later, family business called me out to Solku. On my way back, I was ambushed by Scarlet Triad agents!“They smuggled me back into the city and took me into the Red Pyramid before bagging my head, but I could tell that we went a fair way underground—further than the public areas of the pyramid we all know about. When they removed the hood, I was in a windowless, high-ceilinged workshop built around a supernatural forge. Along with my captured colleagues, we learned that we were slaves—slaves!—and were forced to toil at rebuilding a strange orb out of shards of golden crystal, as well as fashioning replacements for any missing sections. There were so many concave pieces, I was pretty sure we were making a sphere, roughly head-sized, but the work was frustratingly difficult, as if the shards wanted to stay broken!“Every day, spellcasters would come in to examine our work and provide more instructions. Uri stopped by a few times to gloat but otherwise stayed out of our way. He called our work his ‘little contingency,’ and when I prompted him for anything more, he insisted the world would burn if I failed, and then he laughed and added that otherwise it would burn only at his command. After about two weeks, we were done. The result was indeed a golden sphere, as I predicted—with roughly two-thirds of its original pieces. And with that, I guess our usefulness was done. We were to be sold off... or erased!”</blockquote><p>Exavisu’s descriptions of her cell and her work area correspond to areas <b>C19</b> and <b>C21</b> on the map on page 60, and she can provide a fair recounting of these locations from memory. The forge both intrigued and frightened her, for she could sense that something was trapped within, exuded supernatural heat, and was furious at being there. With a successful DC 36 Arcana check, a PC recalls rumors of powerful artifacts known as the <i>orbs of dragonkind</i> that granted control over dragons, and that the orb associated with gold dragons was supposedly shattered centuries ago. A critical success on this check is sufficient to confirm that the gold dragon Mengkare of Hermea was in possession of a large number of these shards, and is said to have given away many of them as gifts to various heads of state. A repaired <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i> could allow someone to control the world’s gold dragons—and potentially do yet more, depending on any other powers infused into the orb.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b> For rescuing the jewelers, Exavisu gives the PCs a felt-lined box that contains the Thuvian Star, an egg-sized, rose-hued, and otherwise flawless star sapphire worth 5,000 gp. In addition, the guild awards the PCs cut gems worth 1,000 gp for each of the three assistants rescued.</p><p><b>Awareness Repercussions:</b> If the PCs ended the heist with 15 or more Awareness Points, their infamy imposes a circumstance penalty on their downtime actions to Influence Guilds equal to one-fifth their final Awareness Point total. This penalty decreases by 1 at the end of each day.</p><p><b>XP Awards:</b> The complex heist’s Experience Points come almost entirely from story awards. Award the PCs 80 XP for completing the infiltration portion of the heist, and another 80 XP for the rescue. Give them an additional 40 XP if they rescued all three assistants and Benneb. For every Awareness threshold the PCs never reached (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25), award the PCs an extra 10 XP. Finally, award the PCs 80 XP if they avoided combat altogether.</p>","_id":"DKxaJWPhoDjamcXT"}

A full scouting attempt takes 4 hours, during which each PC attempts a skill check chosen from the following options, depending on how they wish to scout: Diplomacy DC 40 (to ask local nomads about sightings) or Nature DC 36 (to know about camel behavior and where Duneshadow might best be found). At your discretion, a PC can substitute an appropriate Lore skill for any of these skills, in which case the DC is reduced by 2. To find the camel’s trail, the party must successfully Scout Duneshadow three times. Critical successes count as two successes, and critical failures negate one success. If all PCs abandon this task and no one is Scouting Duneshadow, the number of accumulated successes resets to zero. Magic such as <i>discern location</i> gives two successes toward finding Duneshadow, though he moves so often and in such odd ways that even in the 10 minutes it takes to <i>teleport</i>, only his trail will remain.Once they get three successes, the PCs can then Track him (DC 40).

All the while, his path leads the PCs farther into the foothills of the Brazen Peaks.An attempt to Approach Duneshadow is a slow and deliberate activity that takes 1 hour to perform, during which each PC attempts a skill check chosen from the following options: Acrobatics or Athletics DC 37 (to approach quickly via a shortcut), Deception DC 38 (to trick Duneshadow into evading pursuit in the wrong direction), Nature DC 35 (to keep Duneshadow calm and appear non-threatening), Performance DC 34 (to intrigue Duneshadow with calming music), or Stealth DC 36 (to approach undetected). Lore skills can be substituted for any of these skills, reducing the DC by 2.To reach Duneshadow, the party must successfully Approach four times.

After a few initial public remarks thanking the PCs for their intervention, Xerelilah retires to tend to the town’s injured and help make arrangements for its dead. She doesn’t want to sour the town’s mood with these unpleasant tasks, but she doesn’t see any value in postponing them either. Xerelilah’s departure lets the PCs take center stage at the feast, and they have no end of admiring fans asking for tales of their past exploits. Any PCs who choose to help Xerelilah instead of basking in the adoration earn her heartfelt thanks and respect.</p><p><b>Talking to the Diplomat:</b> At some point during the feast, the Nidalese diplomat Halleka Shadeborn seeks out the PCs as well. Halleka is a lanky, sallow human man with elongated ears and unusually dark green eyes. He is happy to let people in Ravounel assume he is of elven heritage, but he actually descends from a rare relationship between a human and a shadowy creature called a fetchling. Halleka has a habit of running a finger softly down his jawline while he speaks, as though coaxing his words free, which many people find off-putting.</p><p>Halleka explains that he is a formal representative of the Umbral Court in Nidal. He was on his way to Kintargo to speak with that city’s ruling Silver Council when he was captured by the slavers here in Cypress Point. He’s pleased to be on his way again, but he’s worried that Ravounel is more dangerous than he expected, and he’d appreciate having the PCs as companions and bodyguards. Halleka is one of several diplomats working to solidify trade agreements and to establish cultural exchange between the two nations over the next several weeks. His specific area of expertise is velstrac relations; he’s something of an expert on these ominous outsiders (page 82), and he wants to discuss how the Silver Council might improve their city with their velstrac aid. He doesn’t expect a particularly warm reception to the idea of velstracs on the streets of Kintargo, but he knows that difficult ideas planted early sometimes bear surprising fruit.</p><p>The PCs might not want anything to do with Halleka, considering his nationality and his mission. Halleka takes no offense if the PCs don’t want his company, and he simply goes on his way.</p><p>Although Halleka is surprisingly forthright with the PCs, he keeps a few details from the PCs until he knows them better. Each day the PCs spend in Halleka’s company, each PC can attempt a DC 28 Diplomacy or Deception check to convince Halleka to open up to them. Note that the trip from Cypress Point to Kintargo is a 3-day journey, so if the PCs miss one of </p><p>these opportunities they’ll need to continue following up with Halleka in Kintargo (which shouldn’t be a problem, considering he’s planning on staying in the city for many weeks to come).</p><p>Halleka is among the most junior of the Nidalese diplomats visiting the Silver Council in Kintargo. If the PCs manage to befriend him, he reveals during the trip that he’s secretly worried that his delay won’t even be noticed by his superiors, but he intends to perform as well as he can as soon as he arrives. A PC who succeeds at a DC 28 Perception check to Sense Motive realizes that Halleka has no friends in Kintargo and might appreciate it if the PCs spend some time with him while he’s there. If they do, they find that Halleka is eager to catch up and happy to provide his healing services to the PCs free of charge (although he can’t leave the embassies or neglect his duties to travel with them). As a 5th-level cleric of Zon-Kuthon, he is willing to set aside one 3rd-level <i>heal</i> spell, two 2nd-level <i>heal</i> spells, and three 1st-level <i>heal</i> spells daily for this purpose. </p><p><b>Treasure:</b> After the feast, the grateful citizens of Cypress Point present the party with a collection of gold, art objects, free food, and other miscellaneous prizes worth a total of 1,200 gp in all as thanks for saving the town from the raiders.</p>","_id":"EhjypOWyFLuBlTAG"}

Founded about 300 years ago, Finderplain serves as a waypoint for travelers between Nex, Katapesh, and the western wilds. Its predominantly gnome populace is largely transitory, rarely remaining for more than 6 months before departing for other excitement and opportunity. As a result, even the younger structures have often exchanged ownership a dozen times, and any property left abandoned for at least a week is up for grabs. What’s more, Finderplain has weathered at least 50 different governments, having recently wished farewell to Chief Minarchist Dwalginostil’s 11 months of governmental noninterference, and 2 months ago hailed Soukmaster <b>Satla Kivarn</b> (NG female gnome) and her commerce-minded initiatives.</p><p>The last few days of dust storm have forced Finderplain’s occupants to shelter in their homes. Dunes of fine silt have accumulated in the streets, forming low mounds here and there that function as difficult terrain. The streets average about 20 feet in width, with narrow 5-foot alleys splitting off from major streets, and those streets sometimes constricting to 10 feet wide, widening into impromptu plazas as much as 50 feet across or turning abruptly to navigate the haphazard structures.</p><p>Encounters might occur throughout Finderplain based on the PCs’ strategies. Several key areas in Finderplain are described below.</p><p><b>B1. Bazal’s Basin:</b> The largest of Finderplain’s buildings, this earthen hall acts as a town hall, dance parlor, theater, feast hall, temple, and more as needed. Like many of Finderplain’s features, it’s been renamed dozens of times. The main room can hold about 400 people comfortably with another 100 in side rooms—and half again that many if most of them are gnomes.<b>B2. Bluemarket:</b> Largest of Finderplain’s markets, Bluemarket gets its name from the blue-painted, 15-foot-tall obelisk at its center.<b>B3. Spire Walk:</b> This neighborhood is among the oldest in Finderplain and earns its name from the several dozen apartment buildings that stand between three and five stories tall.<b>B4. Royal Rise:</b> By building several strategic walls, High King Narvimelbs combined five different houses and shops into his royal palace in 4717. The compound sits atop a tiny hill that gives it a relatively commanding view.</p><p><b>B5. The Wall:</b> In response to rumors of encroaching gnoll raids, Finderplain’s chancellor Twilu requisitioned funds to build a wall around the young town in 4418 ar. The project resulted in a 20-foot-tall stone fortification that shields only a fraction of Finderplain, for after Twilu departed 3 months later, her successor canceled the project.</p>","_id":"F8XDK8Hrt806VboU"}

At either such point, he sends a pair of stealthy members of the Guild of Arms to shadow the PCs. These stalkers are part of a small contingent of corrupt guards who are secretly working with Mountainheart Chiselrock and, through him, the Scarlet Triad. Chiselrock told these hand-picked guards a carefully curated version of the truth, convincing them a nefarious force at work in the city has put its citizens in grave danger. Furthermore, he told the guards that this force had infiltrated the Guild of Arms, and that Commander Hammersong may be complicit. Now that the PCs are investigating misdeeds in Kovlar, they threaten to expose Chiselrock’s true plans. To get the PCs out of his way, Chiselrock uses his corrupt guards to arrest the PCs and lock them up in a secure location. Instead of killing the PCs, he hopes to be able to use them as scapegoats if he needs someone to frame for his crimes.</p><p>Each time the guards follow the PCs to a new location, have them roll a Stealth check against the PCs’ Perception DCs to see if the PCs notice that they are being followed. The guards continue to follow the PCs until they find anything that could pass for evidence that the PCs are suspicious characters, and then they attempt to arrest the PCs in a public location. After noticing the guards, the PCs may choose to tail them in return. If they do, the PCs can follow the guards back to their base—a disused warehouse in the Barricade District, a site the guards call “Chiselrock’s Prison.”</p><p>If the PCs attack the guards, more guards pour into the streets in the coming rounds. These additional guards are not under Chiselrock’s sway, and they move to put the PCs under arrest for assaulting guards. If the PCs flee the guards, they become outlaws in Kovlar.

Jewelgate was designed as a tribute to Yuelral, the elven goddess of magic, who is known for her strong affinity for crystals and gems. To honor the goddess, Candlaron chose a particularly lovely crystal cavern under what is known today as the Five Kings Mountains as the portal’s destination. He built the way station within Jewelgate to serve as a meditation chamber—a beautiful vault within which visitors could enjoy the glories of crystal formations as a precursor to the wonders of the cavern beyond.</p><p>Unfortunately, the crystal cavern was adjacent to the territory of a Darklands serpentfolk settlement. The serpentfolk were none too welcoming to the surface dwellers, and when the elves’ attempt to parley with them ended in bloodshed, Candlaron decided that it would be best to wait before using the portal again. To ensure that Jewelgate’s way station remained a work of art in Yuelral’s honor and that the serpentfolk didn’t try to invade it, one of Candlaron’s apprentices, a wizard named Talamira, volunteered to become the way station’s caretaker and guardian.</p><p>While the serpentfolk never managed to activate Jewelgate from the Nar-Voth side, they did what they could to make the crystalline caverns much less welcoming, should the elves ever decide to return. The strange magic they infused the crystals with had an unanticipated interaction with Jewelgate, and their sinister energies seeped into the way station’s own crystal gardens over the centuries. This influence was subtle and went unnoticed by Talamira at first, but eventually she realized something strange was going on as the sound of soft wailing from the crystals began to manifest.</p><p>When she first noted the strange effect, Talamira was intrigued by this magical “pollution” from the far side of the portal, and while she wasn’t able to exit the way station, she did what she could to study the influence. But when she attempted to enhance the magic of the crystals to study the effects, the insidious serpentfolk trap triggered, blasting Talamira with necromantic energies that slew her instantaneously. She rose as a ghost not long thereafter, so disoriented by the experience that she not only lost track of the passage of time—she didn’t even realize she’d been killed in the first place. Talamira has since spent many thousand years in a perpetual cycle of study and forgetfulness, unaware that her time has moved on.</p><p>Only one chamber exists within Jewelgate. As with all of the Alseta’s Ring way stations, this one exists in its own demiplane. Air and temperature are regulated by the demiplane to maintain comfortable living conditions within, but attempts to travel beyond the borders of the way station itself do not function, with the exception of planar travel such as using the two <i>aiudara</i> exits.</p>","_id":"GVO3ptRpcbtbncHv"}

The summons grants an audience with the Court of Regents, and is an invitation from the current speaker of that body, Kelda Halrig. This adventure assumes that Parjil leads the PCs directly to Regents’ Hall before taking her leave from the group (she has no further role in this adventure, but you can certainly continue to use her as a guide for the PCs if you wish).</p><p>The meeting with the Court of Regents takes place at a large table in Regents’ Hall, Kovlar’s primary administrative building. Each regent is dressed in finery or armor and carries some sort of symbol of their profession, such as a blacksmith’s hammer or a carpenter’s saw. The attire of the entire council is unified by the identical iron and gold medallion each regent wears around their necks while conducting official business, called a regent’s sigil. These badges of office are relevant to a quest later in the adventure (see Theft from the Vaults on page 25).</p><p>One side of the table is occupied by ten chairs, each decorated with motifs associated with one of Kovlar’s ten guilds. A dwarf sits in each chair, each an individual leader of one of the guilds—a full list appears on pages 19–21. All ten guilds (and thus the ten leaders) have traditionally been considered equal in status and importance. Nevertheless, tradition has held that the leader of the largest guild also serves as the Court’s speaker—the dwarf entrusted with calling meetings, leading them, and helping to navigate disputes. The current Court speaker is Kelda Halrig of the Anvillers’ Guild.</p><p>The meeting with the regents begins as Kelda greets the PCs and welcomes them to Kovlar—read or paraphrase her following words.</p><blockquote>“When the first Court of Regents convened centuries ago, they were regents for Khaddorn the Mighty, the hero who reclaimed Kovlar and most other underground places that remain civilized today from orc invaders. Perhaps someday, a queen or king will rise again who is worthy of that mantle, one as great as the rulers of old. Until that day, it is our solemn duty to work together to keep Kovlar safe and prosperous. You are newcomers to Kovlar, but it is my hope that you will honor this duty. If you are as capable as I hope, you may be able to aid us, but before we can trust you with the city’s defense, we must know that you will indeed honor our traditions.”</blockquote><p>If Parjil escorted the PCs here, the regents know of the PCs’ fight against the gugs, and Kelda takes the time to thank them for eliminating one of Saggorak’s numerous threats to Kovlar’s safety. She then asks the PCs to introduce themselves and state their business in Kovlar.</p><p>The regents listen quietly to the PCs, and appear rightfully concerned should the PCs mention the threats posed by the Scarlet Triad, rumors of a dragon in Saggorak, or even concerns about Dahak’s influence over Alseta’s Ring. At this point, Kelda confides in the PCs that Kovlar has certainly experienced an increased number of troubling incidents in the last few weeks, which make her fear that there is some darker plot afoot. She believes that the PCs might be able to get to the bottom of these incidents where her own guards have failed, and she knows that the Court of Regents would reward the PCs richly for their aid. There’s just one problem—many of the members of the Court need convincing that turning to outsiders like the PCs is the best way to address their internal troubles. Indeed, a PC who makes a successful DC 25 Perception check to Sense Motive can certainly tell that, other than Kelda, the dwarven guild leader regard the PCs with some measure of suspicion.</p>","_id":"Hs16tH5PuiwqSkTR"}

This adventure doesn’t present a full map of the sprawling expanse of Saggorak, as the expectation is that the PCs will have detailed directions to specific locations in the haunted city once their adventures take them there. Although the PCs have no such context or knowledge when they first exit the Hall of Devouring Giants, the distant glow of the magical lights to the south along the wall separating Kovlar from the rest of Saggorak should serve as a beacon to lure the PCs.</p><p>Fortunately, the living dwarves of Kovlar do maintain something of a presence in Saggorak. In particular, a dwarven scout by the name of Parjil Longbraid has been keeping an eye on the hall for many days. Worried about rumors that a group of gugs had been spotted in the city, Parjil was sent by Kovlar to observe the monsters for several days to ascertain if they posed a threat. A priest of Magrim, the stern dwarven god of death and ancestors, Parjil is torn regarding the gugs and is unsure what to do about them. On the one hand, they’re certainly dangerous and evil neighbors to be concerned about, but on the other hand, they seem to be preying mostly on the undead and appear to have little interest in meddling with Kovlar’s affairs. As a result, Parjil has all but decided to leave the gugs alone, but when she spots the PCs emerging from the building, curiosity gets the better of her and she cautiously calls out to them.</p><p>As a worshipper of Magrim, Parjil has long loathed undead and their corruption of the natural cycle of life and death. She’s spent much of her life patrolling the streets of Saggorak to keep an eye on the undead that haunt the ruins, and in those years, she has encountered numerous bands of surface adventurers. Between those who shared her hatred of undead and were on crusading quests and those who simply saw Saggorak as an abandoned location to loot, Parjil knows that adventuring groups represent a wide range of personalities and goals. She hopes that the PCs are more heroes than looters when she hails them, introducing herself as a sentinel of Kovlar and enemy to those who walk after death before she asks the PCs their names and purpose in Saggorak.</p><p>Parjil is open minded and experienced much in her life, but if the PCs reveal that they came to Saggorak via an <i>aiudara</i>, she is both surprised and intrigued, having never heard of or even suspected that such a gate existed in Saggorak. As far as she knew, the countless tunnels beyond Saggorak’s walls led only into the Darklands, whose monsters clash with the spirits of the dwarven ancestors. If the PCs report what the captive ghast said about a dragon king, she is further alarmed, as there have been no rumors of draconic activity in the region. Mention of the Scarlet Triad likewise fails to solicit any sense of recognition. It shouldn’t be long before Parjil recommends that the PCs return with her to Kovlar to speak to the Court of Regents—the city’s leaders. If external forces are indeed turning their attention to Saggorak, the dwarves of Kovlar need to know.As long as the PCs take a direct route to Kovlar in Parjil’s company, they will not face further significant opposition at this point. At your option, the PCs might encounter a minor group of undead or other foes, but by and large you should hold off on significant clashes for now. Parjil’s role in this adventure is to facilitate the PCs’ transition into the next chapter, so if the PCs opt instead to head into Saggorak on their own, you may need to look to Chapter 3 for inspiration and additional encounters. Eventually, the dangers of Saggorak should convince the PCs to seek shelter in the safer and more civilized reaches of Kovlar to the south.</p><p>If the PCs accompany Parjil, they’ll have time to take in the scenery during the hour-long walk through ruined Saggorak. The city’s buildings are constructed primarily from stone, with accents of metal and crystal. The city is cloaked in darkness, as its undead inhabitants are not fond of light. Empty torch sconces and the occasional fragments of a shattered lantern are the only remnants of the lights that ancient dwarves once used to illuminate their city. A combination of rampant looting, neglect, and ongoing conflicts with various invaders from the Darklands and from Kovlar to the south have scarred the city, obscuring the original functions of many of its buildings. </p><p>In these dark and desolate streets, the lights of Kovlar shine all the brighter. The glow of the city’s lights can be easily seen from most points in Saggorak. The tallest spires of Kovlar’s buildings rise above its fortified walls, and warm, reddish-orange light glows from the thriving settlement. Any PCs who succeed at a DC 25 Society check recognize Kovlar and know that the city is best known for its high-quality weapons and armor, as well as the perilous haunted ruins outside its gates, and that the lights that illuminate its walls serve the dual purpose of putting visitors from the surface at ease and warding off the undead who still haunt the remainder of the subterranean region.</p>","_id":"NAEl1MRSq1Y7lQyw"}

Among these are a <i>grinning pugwampi</i> (page 77), a major bestial mutagen, a sapphire-studded wedding band worth 200 gp, five withered gnoll ears, the bejeweled hilt of a large sword (missing its blade but still worth 500 gp), and a gold chain with intricate charms worth 150 gp, one of which bears the inscription “spice of my life” in Kelish—a term of affection.</p><p>Once the wendigo is dead and the storm dissipated, the people of Finderplain take a day to clean out their dust-choked homes and gather money to help compensate the PCs for their assistance. This reward includes an assortment of currencies from 27 different nations, totaling 57 pp, 1,376 gp, and 1,420 sp. On top of this, Satla gives the PCs a major eagle-eye elixir and a major elixir of life.</p><p><b>Aftermath:</b> Once the PCs defeat the wendigo, the <i>control weather</i> ritual gradually fades over the next 12 hours, during which time the dust storm weakens from a deadly gale to an irritating storm to clear skies. Any surviving elementals lose interest in the failing storm and retreat back to the surrounding desert and scrub.</p>","_id":"NlIMb45Xtiardr02"}

That means I oversee trade, general mayoral duties, and emergency operations as needed.”</p><p><b>Is this storm normal?</b> “Short answer: no. Finderplain’s not got a lot of longtime residents and historians, but a dust storm should not last this long and be this fierce. We’re two days into it, and it’s stronger than ever. Scouts have skirmished with monsters out there, yet we don’t know if they started the storm or are just enjoying it.”</p><p><b>What was that howling out there?</b> Satla grimaces. “You heard it, too, huh? There’s something—maybe somethings—really creepy out there prowling the streets. Worse, some of the survivors we’ve pulled in have mentioned hearing whispering urges toward violence, or were tormented for hours by hearing voices promising the end of the world. Others have seen glowing eyes and horns that disappear into the dust. Whatever it is, it’s cruel, smart, and relentless.”</p><p><b>Has anything else suspicious happened recently?</b>“Not especially? We get all sorts of strange travelers through here. A pair of dour Nexian Arclords passed through town earlier in the week, and then we had some Scarlet Triad folks being obnoxious until just around just a few hours before the storm started, but that’s nothing that should have triggered Rovagug’s tantrum out there.”</p><p><b>The Scarlet Triad was here?</b> “Yeah, though they might have gotten out before the storm.” Satla confirms the PCs aren’t Triad members before adding, “Good riddance to them, too. They’re utter jackals every time they’re here.”</p><p><b>How can we help?</b> Satla gives a tentative smile. “Hey, we can use all the help we can get. There are only a few of us left who are strong enough to hold our own against the monsters. We’ve also got a lot of local leaders who we’ve yet to find, dead or alive. At this point, I need information, rescuers, those leaders, and supplies—food and water, especially. And if you can figure out how to stop the storm, all the better.”</p>","_id":"ON2R00nzvN7V0zhY"}

Use the Salt Warehouse map on page 43 for this area.</p><p><b>Creature:</b> Ishti is a powerful lamia matriarch whose innate occult powers have only grown stronger with time, but she never mastered the art of casting spontaneous occult spells; instead, she’s developed incredible skill at working with poison and a complete immunity to poisons of all kinds. She is usually in her human form, but she transforms into her true form in combat. If reduced to 40 or fewer Hit Points, she attempts to flee, abandoning the warehouse and Katapesh for the rest of the adventure.</p><h4>Ishti - Creature 18</h4>","_id":"PdtKgpoGX8xXKvd2"}

A pair of circular altars surrounded by stone chairs sit in the middle of the room. Several pieces of parchment lie on the stone altars, while the walls have been inscribed with hundreds, if not thousands of words.</blockquote><p>This room was primarily used for meetings international or personal in nature when the participants wanted to ensure peaceful conduct. On one end of the spectrum, they hosted diplomatic meetings with ambassadors from other kingdoms. On the other end, people seeking to resolve individual disputes would call upon the dwarven gods’ blessing for a peaceful resolution. Each time a significant feud or ongoing conflict was resolved in the hall, the priests inscribed the names of the participants upon the walls of the chamber, along with a brief summary of the feud’s topic. Those who resumed conflicts that these walls claimed were resolved were subject to harsh fines or could be arrested and imprisoned in the dungeons below. The walls still contain an inscribed warning to that effect in Dwarven, “Go now in peace, those who Grundinnar and Kols have blessed here. To break this sacred oath is to invite Drangvitt’s wrath.” As the inscription suggests, the priests of Grundinnar and Kols shared these halls. The name of Grundinnar, god of friendship and loyalty, was invoked when building relationships was at the forefront of the discussion. In contrast, the name of Kols the Oathkeeper was invoked when the participants wanted to ensure that no one would break their solemn promises. </p><p>This room is also where the Scarlet Triad has been pursuing negations with duergar slavers from Hagegraf, as a few minutes looking through the parchment notes reveals—this examination also confirms many of Ilssrah’s plans for the region, as detailed on page 3; use these notes to answer any minor questions the PCs may still have about the dwarven woman’s goals in the region, as you see fit. </p><p><b>Creatures:</b> A pair of two-armed glabrezus stand vigil here, agents of Droskar whose smaller arms were removed years ago as punishment. Embermead summoned them to serve as protection should the negotiations with the duergar turn sour, and promised to work magic to restore their missing arms after their service is completed. Embermead is cautious around the demons, but she hasn’t entirely escaped their manipulations. The glabrezus attack the PCs on sight—note that they lack the claw attacks of typical treachery demons, and must rely only on their pincers and jaws in melee.</p><blockquote><h4>Glabrezus (2) - CREATURE 13</h4><br><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 79<br><b>Initiative</b> Deception +28</blockquote><p><b>Treasure:</b> A successful DC 34 Perception check is enough to discover a hidden panel in the northern wall that contains a small stash of scrolls.

He started this ambitious project in 4552 ar, but in 4606 ar, just as the Endeavor was beginning to gain speed on its third generation, the deadly storms that heralded the start of the Age of Lost Omens devastated Hermea and set back Mengkare’s plans. Over the months that followed, the gold dragon realized he needed to focus his attentions on protecting and guiding the Endeavor on Hermea, and thus couldn’t spare the time to personally seek out talented and gifted humans on the mainland. And so he outsourced that task, recruiting a talented merchant from Katapesh who had been dealing with three mercantile consortiums: a fleet of traders who ran the route between Katapesh and Cheliax, a dwarven trade organization that maintained relations between the Five Kings Mountains and Katapesh, and a local group of merchants. By mid-4607 ar, these three groups had united under Mengkare’s guidance and became the Scarlet Triad.For decades, the Scarlet Triad served as “talent scouts” for Promise, but as the Glorious Endeavor gained momentum and population, the need for new blood waned. Mengkare reduced his funding of the Scarlet Triad as a result, but the members of that group had developed a taste for coin and wealth. By 4690 ar, the group took its first tentative (and very secret) steps into the slave trade, figuring that since they were already seeking out talented and gifted people for recruitment to Promise, those who didn’t meet the strict requirements for inclusion could still fetch a high price as slaves.The Scarlet Triad’s current leader, Uri Zandivar, has kept their new venture quiet from Mengkare, although his elder sister Emaliza, who served on Mengkare’s Council of Enlightenment, knew full well what the Triad was up to. With her aid, Uri managed to prevent Mengkare from learning the truth about the Scarlet Triad’s corruption into slavery—as long as they continued to provide the good human stock the dragon sought and did so at reduced overhead, things ran smoothly. When Absalom outlawed slavery in 4717 ar, the Scarlet Triad saw a significant portion of their business crash and burn, and over the past few years, they’ve been working to branch out, most significantly into Cheliax’s slave trade and into the Darklands below the Five Kings Mountains (drawing upon their legacy of trade connections to these nations), both regions where slavery was still a legal business.</p><p>The gnoll slaver Laslunn earned her place as Uri’s third-in-command by virtue of her heartless efficiency and her remarkable ability to judge potential slaves. Uri placed Laslunn in charge of co-opting the Chelish slave trade. To do this, Laslunn went not to Cheliax but to Ravounel, the new nation recently formed from Cheliax’s former northwestern province. Laslunn knew that the Chelish slave networks hadn’t simply evaporated when Ravounel turned away from diabolism and evil, and she hoped to rekindle those old slaver’s networks before they were lost completely.</p><p>Laslunn’s base of operations in Kintargo is Sunset Imports, a trading company that has fallen on hard times. From here, individual slaver cells have spread throughout Ravounel, including into the declining Alabaster Academy and the outlying town of Cypress Point. With these preparations in place, Laslunn withdrew from Kintargo to an abandoned granite quarry in the Menador Mountains in southern Ravounel. This quarry is Laslunn’s current headquarters and the holding area of her most valuable slaves.</p><p>The Silver Council that leads Kintargo has their hands full dealing with political pressures and tense rivalries with neighbors on two fronts—Nidal to the northeast and Cheliax to the south—and this has allowed Laslunn’s slavers to spread quickly. While the council does its best to curtail the slave trade, it has fallen upon another organization to oppose the Scarlet Triad—the Bellflower Network. This informal organization of predominantly halfling abolitionists and slave-liberators has long been active in Cheliax and considers Ravounel a safe base of operations. When a new network of slavers appeared right in their backyard, the Bellflower Network was quick to respond. The leaders of the network—including Laria Longroad and a secretive halfling who uses the folk-hero name “Nolly Peltry”—activated their agents immediately. Unfortunately, Laslunn is well aware of the Bellflower Network and has agents in place to oppose its efforts. This shadow war beneath the atmosphere of tense negotiations in the Silver City is putting all of Kintargo on edge.</p><p>Laslunn continues to carry out the Scarlet Triad’s directives, but she has her own agenda as well. From correspondence with Voz Lirayne (see <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #145: Hellknight Hill</i>), Laslunn has learned of Alseta’s Ring and the network of gates it contains. She’s heard whispers about the Scarlet Triad’s plans for Alseta’s Ring, but even with her lofty position, she isn’t considered senior enough to be trusted with the details of these plans. Irritated by these secrets and determined to find out more, the gnoll slaver dispatched a few agents to the town of Breachill to find out why Voz has gone silent. Laslunn isn’t aware that the PCs have already bested Voz, but she’ll soon learn that fact when the PCs bring the fight to her.</p>","_id":"R89cNbOS43vj9d32"}

However, they are wary of any truly devastating threats represented by particularly dangerous monsters. Such was the case when word spread of a lumbering burrowing monstrosity the size of an elephant and capable of spitting fire that attacked a large caravan on the way to the city. Just before this chapter begins, Uri Zandivar penned a declaration to the Farmers’ Union insisting that this attack was a one-time event and that there’s nothing to worry about, yet his dismissive nonchalance left the farmers seething with rage. The Pactmasters have not yet investigated the attack, for it took place well beyond the city walls. They’ve promised to send the Zephyr Guard to investigate should a pattern of attacks emerge in the future, but this is not enough to reassure the Union. Representatives want decisive action before the fire-breathing monster strikes again.</p><p>This provides an excellent opportunity for the PCs to ingratiate themselves with the Farmers’ Union. With little difficulty, a PC can find several witnesses to describe the attack. Each describes the monster as being larger than an elephant and shaped like an immense beetle, with fire glowing from within and plumes of steam and smoke venting from horns along its armored back. The creature attacked after the caravan had stopped to camp for the night. It burst from the ground an hour after sunset and overturned a wagon before guards had a chance to even draw their weapons, then devoured several people and incinerated more several before diving back into the sand with an entire horse clenched in its mandibles. The survivors made it to Katapesh, only to have their claims of being attacked by a fire-breathing monster all but ignored by the Scarlet Triad, who have supposedly promised to protect the Farmers’ Union from precisely these types of dangers.</p><p>The monster hasn’t been sighted again, but the caravanners suspect that is because no other caravan has dared take the same route to the city, and detours are costing them time and resources. The attack itself, according to the survivors, took place in a stretch of arid desert about 120 miles southwest of the city. If she hears of this attack, Satla notes this site is only 60 miles east of Finderplain, adding a new element of worry to her fears and compelling her to pressure the PCs to investigate before these monsters have a chance to menace the town. Before the PCs leave, the survivors remind them that the creature didn’t attack until well after sunset, suggesting that the monster hunts only at night, and that camping at the site of the massacre might be the best bet to lure the monster out.</p><p>Following the directions given by survivors, the PCs can reach the site of the attack after a 120 mile trip southwest from Katapesh. Details of this overland journey are not covered here, as high-level characters have a wealth of options for swift overland travel and the types of threats they’ll meet on the road are not particularly significant, but feel free to spice up the PC’s trip with additional encounters if you see fit.</p><p>Once the PCs arrive at the site, they find evidence of the battle in the form of a dry oasis, the vegetation at its edges burnt to a crisp, and patches of sand surrounding the now-barren watering hole have been cooked to sheets of glass.</p><p><b>Creature:</b> The PCs don’t have the whole story, as they will soon discover, for it’s not one but two fire-breathing monsters that have chosen the caravan route as their territory. These monsters are relative newcomers to Katapesh, huge creatures spawned from the not-entirely-dead corpse of one of Rovagug’s legendary spawn—Xotani the Firebleeder. Spawn hatch from its corpse infrequently, and most burrow deep into the Darklands to avoid the light of the sun, but in this case a pair of the monsters have instead traveled to the surface. Sunlight still vexes them, so they spend their nights slumbering under the sands and stones of the desert. Their last meal of horses and caravan guards left the pair sated for days, but by the time the PCs arrive and camp at the site of the previous attack, they are hungry once again.</p><p>Based solely on the description of the creature given by survivors, a successful DC 45 Nature check to Recall Knowledge about the monster suggests the creature’s nocturnal nature might make light-based attacks useful, and its use of fire implies cold could be a potent weapon, but fire is unlikely to harm the creature. A critical success on this check allows the PC to realize the truth, that this is one of the spawn of Xotani the Firebleeder, in which case you can give the PC more information about the monster as you see fit. Once the PCs face the Xotanispawn in combat, the DC to Recall Knowledge about them drops to 40.</p><p>True to the survivors’ prediction, the Xotanispawn do not arrive to investigate camping PCs until an hour after sunset. Although immense, these creatures are unusually stealthy as they burrow through the ground and they use Stealth to determine initiative. The combat begins with a single Xotanispawn emerging from the dry oasis, bursting from the grit to blast the PCs with its breath weapon. The second Xotanispawn doesn’t join the fight until the start of the fourth round, or the round after the first Xotanispawn is slain—whichever comes first. The monsters fight to the death.</p><h4>Xotanispawn - Feat 17</h4><p><b>Treasure:</b> If the PCs return with proof of the monsters’ defeat (a set of mandibles or other body part is enough—the shape of the monster’s body having been burned into the survivors’ nightmares), the Farmers’ Union rewards the PCs 3,000 gp (the fee they would have otherwise provided the Scarlet Triad the next month) upon their return to Katapesh. More importantly, completing this task is enough to convince the Farmers’ Union to vote against the Scarlet Triad.</p>","_id":"RaWL1nzjIHJR3MB3"}

If you find the PCs aren’t motivated on their own to travel through Duskgate, feel free to have an NPC they trust make the suggestion to them. You can also use the results of divination spells the PCs cast to encourage them to open Duskgate.</p><p>In keeping with many other portals associated with Alseta’s Ring, the area between Duskgate’s Isger side and its Katapesh side consists of an extraplanar series of rooms: the Duskgate Way Station. This way station is intact but, as with the others, hasn’t been visited in thousands of years. Decorated with images of stags cavorting before the setting sun, Duskgate was the last of Candlaron’s gateways constructed in Alseta’s Ring. To a PC who succeeds at a DC 34 Perception check, this is evident from the workmanship of the exterior portal, which reveals an increased level of artistry in the carvings and sculpting of the portal itself—an appropriate development, considering Duskgate’s dedication to Findeladlara, the elven goddess of architecture and art. Originally, the way station within was intended to serve as a monument to elven architecture and artwork, but millennia of proximity to Dahak’s manifestation have lent the decor and guardians a destructive malevolence that manifests as a host of creatures and hazards.</p><p>With the <i>guiding chisel</i> recovered from Embermead in “Fires of the Haunted City” in hand, the PCs can readily open the exterior entryway, causing the stone within Duskgate to turn misty, glow softly, and then sink into the ground like the sun setting over a foggy horizon, providing access to area <b>A1</b>.</p><p>The rooms within Duskgate Way Station are 15 feet tall at the walls, with delicately arching ceilings that peak at a height of 20 feet at their centers.

Now that the <i>Guiding Chisel</i> is in their grasp, the PCs can open the way to Duskgate at their convenience. They can continue to build relations with their allies in Kovlar as they wish, but the dwarven city has no further direct role to play in Age of Ashes, as written.</p><p>By this point, with the true extent of the threats facing Kovlar revealed, most members of the Stonemasons’ Guild come to accept that Chiselrock was corrupt. His betrayal deals a blow to the guild’s prestige, but they slowly begin to distance themselves from his crimes.</p><p>If the PCs slew Veshumirix, Kovlar no longer has to fear a powerful and unpredictable alliance of foes operating within and outside of its walls. In recognition of the great services the PCs have done for the city, the Court of Regents grants them citizenship, as well as the right to receive a full decade of training from any of the guilds, free of charge.</p><p>If the PCs lose their battle against Veshumirix, or if they chose not to fight the dragon at all, he continues to solidify his base of power in Saggorak. Working with his undead minions and any surviving members of the Scarlet Triad, the dragon schemes to undermine and eventually conquer Kovlar. Rather than opening with a direct attack on the city, he aims to first weaken the Court of Regents, sow division, and bait soldiers into combat with an army of undead. Only then does he intend to burn through Kovlar’s defenses and attack the city. The PCs, if they have not already been following the situation, receive a distress call at this time. Within a few months, unless heroes rise to stop him, the dragon succeeds at his plan to take over the city and claim its riches for his burgeoning hoard. King Harral mounts a resistance to the dragon, but his forces prove insufficient, and most of the undead who are capable of leaving the sites of their deaths to warn of the attack fall to Magrimite crusaders unaware of the complicated political situation in the haunted city.</p><p>Finally, there’s the matter of the undead of Saggorak. For so many centuries, the city has remained haunted, but Veshumirix’s attack has devastated the ruins. Just as fire can painfully cauterize a wound and then allow it to heal, the devastation of the dragon’s presence could allow Saggorak’s ruins to recover. If the PCs allied with King Harral and return his crown, the undead dwarf is astounded by the unexpected move. This act of generosity, combined with the fact that so few of his undead remain, causes the king to sigh in relief and swiftly crumble away to dust, leaving behind his weapons and crown. As long as the crown remains on his throne, Saggorak will continue to recover, and in time could be reclaimed by the living, but if the crown is removed before all of the undead move on, King Harral reforms, angrier than ever.</p><p>If the PCs help to bring peace to King Harral, they should earn at least 80 XP—or whatever amount is needed for them to reach 15th level.</p>","_id":"Rv9v51DlPIN68zPO"}

And yes, your wainwright is fine—if our conversation goes well, he’ll stay fine. I’ve arranged for this meeting to ask you about a former associate and perhaps offer you a job, and I have no reason to see anyone hurt, particularly not the poor exhausted gentleman in the room behind me. So, if you’ve the inclination, I’ve a few questions for you.” </blockquote><p>Heuberk has already cast <i>discern lies</i>, and he idly mentions this to the PCs to discourage them from trying to trick him. If the PCs demand to see Fadelby, Heuberk sighs but then opens the doors to area <b>A2</b> wider so that Fadelby is visible (bound, gagged, and unconscious next to another sneak armed with a knife). Heuberk then asks the following questions.</p><p><b>What became of Voz Lirayne?</b> Heuberk already knows that Voz was operating out of a bookshop in Breachill and that she confronted the PCs—whether the PCs killed or captured her in “Hellknight Hill,” Heuberk already knows that outcome from investigations around town. He asks this question first primarily to gauge whether the PCs intend to be honest with him.</p><p><b>Where are Voz’s notes about Alseta’s Ring?</b> With Voz dead, Heuberk wants her notes to bring back to Laslunn. He already knows she made them, and he suspects they ended up in the PCs’ hands. If the PCs say they can get the notes for Heuberk, he allows only one of the PCs to leave to fetch them; he insists everyone else remain with him to ensure compliance.</p><p><b>What do you know about Alseta’s Ring?</b> Heuberk suspects the PCs know quite a bit about the Ring, although he’s unaware of their transit to Garund in “Cult of Cinders.” If he learns this, he may ask a few more questions about the fate of the Cinderclaws at your option.</p><p><b>Would you be willing to work for my associates?</b>If the PCs ask for more details, Heuberk won’t tell them who he works for other than calling them “an international group of powerful merchants who know how to take care of their employees.” If the PCs seem interested, he won’t mince words—he tells the PCs to go out and “fetch three people who won’t be missed and who’ll be excellent stock for the slave trade, and return here with them by next midnight.”</p><p><b>Working for Heuberk:</b> If the PCs indicate to Heuberk that they’re interested in working for him, he relies on his Perception and <i>discern lies</i> spell to determine if they’re trying to trick him. If he suspects treachery, he shakes his head sadly and says, “Lies and deception won’t get you far with my associates, so I’ll have to retract my offer,” before he attacks. If the PCs manage to deceive him, they can use the extra time to engineer a rescue of Fadelby or fight the Triad members as they see fit, but if they take too long to deliver appropriate slaves, Heuberk has Fadelby executed and the slavers leave town. Note that this Adventure Path does not expect the PCs to embrace the option to become slavers, even as a method of “infiltrating” the enemy and taking them down from within. If you think this plot twist would be acceptable for your players (keeping in mind that the notion of slavery is distasteful to many, and is an evil act), feel free to change the campaign’s course as you see fit.</p><p><b>Concluding Negotiations:</b> Heuberk is arrogant, smug, and self-assured, and once the PCs have answered his questions (and assuming they aren’t interested in becoming slavers themselves), Heuberk asks the PCs to wait in the workshop while he “prepares to leave.” He then steps back into area <b>A2</b> and has one of his associates close the door while the other triggers the trapped lathe, hoping that the device kills the PCs. Once the trap winds down, the agents open the door again to attack the PCs, hoping to finish them off. One sneak stays by Fadelby’s side, ready to cut his throat at Heuberk’s command or if anyone approaches him. Heuberk hopes to kill the PCs and stop them from further meddling in Scarlet Triad plans, but tries to escape back to Ravounel if at least two sneaks are slain or he is reduced below 30 Hit Points. If he does escape, feel free to have the PCs encounter him later in the campaign—he otherwise has no further scripted role to play in the Age of Ashes Adventure Path.</p><p><b>Interrogating Heuberk:</b> If the PCs manage to capture Heuberk alive, they can interrogate him. At first, he offers to provide information on the condition that the PCs let him go, but he’ll also give the information to save his life. He admits to being newly arrived in Breachill and that the plot to abduct Fadelby was solely to draw the PCs into this trap. He’ll admit that the organization he works for is the Scarlet Triad (a mercantile consortium, he claims—admitting that the group is focused on slavery only if made helpful and asked directly), and that he’s come on a personal mission from one of the group’s leaders, a fierce gnoll slaver named Laslunn. Laslunn is interested in learning more about Alseta’s Ring and has recently set up extensive operations in the nation of Ravounel, but Heuberk doesn’t have very much specific information about that. He was supposed to meet Laslunn at a shipping company called Sunset Imports in Kintargo once he returned. This is the most important bit of information Heuberk should convey to the PCs, but if he doesn’t, the PCs will have the chance to learn this information later anyway.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> Once the PCs learn about the Scarlet Triad’s link to Sunset Imports (be it from Heuberk or later in this chapter), award them 80 XP.</p>","_id":"TUFGB1glZrfx06I2"}

All the PCs need do to qualify for a fight is show up before noon on any Toilday or Sunday (the second or last day of the week), present themselves as contestants, and sign some basic paperwork that absolves the Gladiators’ Guild of any responsibility. The armsmaster on duty takes note of each PC and schedules them for a feature fight, informing them that they’ll be facing an immense invertebrate predator—a duneshaker solifugid—that trappers subdued and sold to the arena only last week (see Creature on page 33).</p><p><b>The Arena:</b> The Grand Coliseum is immense, sporting dozens of rows of seating that hold more than 10,000 spectators. The performance field is a broad oval roughly 300 feet long and 200 feet wide, with a floor of hard-packed dirt covered in a layer of loose sand. Passageways beneath the field lead to various trapdoors and simple elevators that allow contestants to make dramatic entrances.</p><p><b>Arena Rules:</b> Although accidents occasionally happen, contestants are to make every effort to avoid harming spectators. Contestants are forbidden from having spells in effect when the battle begins, and the fighting itself begins on the third blast of the armsmaster’s horn—almost always after the participants have had a chance to grandstand and pander to the audience. Contestants typically begin 50 to 80 feet apart. It’s traditional, but not mandatory, to offer a defeated intelligent foe mercy or to seek the crowd’s direction in whether a fallen foe should live or die. Enchantments that provide extreme mental control are considered poor form, and officials intervene in the match if powerful enchantments would make a contest unsporting. There’s no looting of the fallen allowed, as their equipment either belongs to their patron or becomes the property of their family.

The DC for checks to Pander to the Crowd during the qualification match is 33.</p><p><b>Creature:</b> The guild enjoys pitting gladiators against powerful beasts, paying well for especially large or uncommon creatures to fight. About a week ago, trappers returned to Katapesh with a true prize, a duneshaker solifugid. Bshez was delighted and let it loose on several warriors during the next combat; the solifugid shredded the competition—literally. She’s been waiting for promising contestants to face the beast again, and her armsmaster identifies the PCs as ideal candidates.</p><p>The arachnid is not a subtle foe. It emerges into the center of the arena from below, bursting out of a 30-foot-square pit filled with sand. After menacingly rattling its chelicerae, it charges at the PCs. Although the solifugid isn’t particularly intelligent, the spectacle of its attacks allows it to Pander to the Crowd as a reaction after it damages a PC; it uses Athletics to attempt this check.</p><p>If the PCs are in trouble, they can indicate their desire to surrender, at which point arena staff rush out to distract the enormous solifugid. It takes another round of combat before the solifugid chases after the swift-footed staff, giving any surviving PCs a chance to escape. A full minute passes before the staff can lure the solifugid back into captivity and begin trying to stabilize the fallen.</p><p>If the PCs defeat the solifugid, the crowd cheers in admiration, and arena staff swiftly emerge from side gates to clean up the battleground and remove the corpse. Bshez glowers from the front row before leaping over the railing and landing deftly in the sand, where she makes a show of publicly praising the PCs’ performance and uses the opportunity to promote upcoming events. She’s not above muttering disparagement of the PCs (and their beginners’ luck) as they depart the stage.</p><p>The PCs receive more sincere praise from the other gladiators, none of whom wanted to risk the solifugid’s hunger and all of whom are glad to see it dead. This is a good opportunity for the PCs to hear more gossip about Bshez’s decisive takeover, the Scarlet Triad’s keen interest in the guild, the guild members’ general displeasure at their drastically reduced life expectancies, and the difficulty of dislodging Bshez—ideally kickstarting a physically capable PC down the path of taking over the guild. The gladiators are somewhat heartened at any bold declarations of reform that PC makes, but for now they expect the words are all talk.</p><blockquote><h4>Duneshaker Solifugid - CREATURE 18</h4><br>Page 89<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +30</blockquote><p><b>Rewards:</b> For defeating the solifugid, the PCs receive 1,500 gp as prize money.

By this point, the PCs are well enough known in Katapesh that they can quickly secure a meeting with the guildmaster <b>Hahcuss Hrann</b> (LN male human alchemist). He welcomes them and invites them to share a drink, wryly laughing off any reticence about accepting beverages from a known poisoner.

However, the PCs’ visit to the guild attracts Ishti’s attention, so she assumes her human guise, confirms Hahcuss is attempting to counteract her poison, and poisons him as well to stymie any cure. Her use of enchantment magic and Lamia’s Caress leaves the Poison Makers’ Guild members with no clear recollection of her visit. By the time the PCs return for answers, Hahcuss is already under the effects of nightmare salt, having ingested it from his salt-rimmed glass when he took an early break. One of his assistants remembers seeing an unfamiliar Garundi woman working in a nearby lab, but enchantment magic caused the assistant to not question her presence; they can describe her, however, and particularly remember her hands being speckled with tiny scars, as if from handling poisons or alchemy for years.

Founded in 1559 ar by Saggorn the Holy, the proud kingdom’s first years were filled with strife. Yet between the conflicts, society in Saggorak flourished. It earned itself the moniker of the “Pious Kingdom,” as Saggorn’s faith inspired him to build opulent temples to the dwarven gods and stockpile sacred relics, transforming Saggorak into a center of faith and pilgrimage site. When the centuries of warfare finally came to an end with the Kerse Accords, Saggorak experienced a golden age. Its population swelled, as prosperity encouraged larger families and drew in dwarves from outlying areas. The most dramatic surge in population came in the beginning of the 26th century ar, when armies of orcs laid siege to the kingdoms of the Five Kings Mountains. Saggorak’s citizens were well supplied, and they stood fast without contact with the outside world, but the orc siege of the city was relentless. After a dozen years, the last remaining citizen of Saggorak perished to starvation. Orcs took the city, looted it, and pillaged it, but they did not stay long, for Saggorak’s people rose from death to strike against the invaders. Hundreds of orcs fell to this onslaught, their corpses bolstering Saggorak’s army of restless dead, and the survivors finally abandoned the haunted city to its undead inheritors. Saggorak’s last king, the now-undead King Harral, commanded the loyalty of his former citizens, rallying them into an organized force. Saggorak’s lost souls remained vigilant against threats to their city, repelling opportunistic orcs as well as forces from the Darklands that wished to claim the city as their prize. Little changed for 700 years, until the dwarf general Khaddon the Mighty launched a crusade against the orc armies. When Khaddon’s armies reached Saggorak, they realized that the city posed a unique challenge. Its undead defenders, which had repelled the orcs successfully for so long, saw Khaddon’s forces as invaders as well. Khaddon’s armies were more prepared for warfare against living foes than they were against the dead. Khaddon also recognized that if he were to reclaim the city, he would need to station a substantial contingent of his weary armies to protect the nearby entrance to the Darklands. As a result, Khaddon cleared out only the southernmost district of the haunted city, renaming it Kovlar.</p><p>Kovlar began primarily as a small military base, supported by a group of brave and skilled artisans who gradually rebuilt the city. To the surprise of Kovlar’s citizens, the undead of neighboring Saggorak showed little interest in retaking Kovlar, so long as Kovlar remained squarely within its own walls. Paradoxically, Kovlar faced fewer threats than other dwarven settlements, as the undead sentinels effectively repelled most threats from the Darklands. Kovlar’s people learned to live peacefully with their undead neighbors. Though the occasional group of crusaders still ventured into the city, the undead accepted these incursions, as for every undead destroyed by a crusader, the living fell in turn to become powerful new undead.</p><p>When Mengkare shattered the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i> and triggered the eruption of Droskar’s Crag, the violent disaster caused death and displacement on a massive scale. Among the displaced creatures was a clutch of magma dragons, one of whom, Moschabbatt, claimed legendary treasures and became one of the most infamous dragons of Avistan. All that his envious younger brother Veshumirix managed to claim from the wreckage was a fragment of the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i>. As he fled the eruption, though, Veshumirix beheld a vision in the fire and ash—the visage of the draconic god of destruction, Dahak. His fevered dreams became consumed with visions of fire and destruction, and scenes of the death and treachery that had taken place under the mountains. While Veshumirix prayed and searched for a way to make his destructive desires come to fruition, he launched himself with renewed energy into the task of raising his own prestige. He sought an unclaimed source of dwarven artifacts and ready minions, and he found it in a location he had seen in his dreams: Saggorak.</p><p>Upon reaching the city, Veshumirix set about finding the leader of the undead forces, using his molten breath to incinerate those who stood in his way. He was the greatest threat the undead of Saggorak had ever faced, and his destructive rampage drew King Harral out of his well-defended palace. Harral put up an admirable fight, but Veshumirix slew him and stole away his treasures—Harral’s crown chief among them. With that, he gained command over much of the undead in the city, and reduced those who openly opposed his new rule to ash.</p><p>But Saggorak was not enough to satisfy Veshumirix’s greed for power. He considered conquering Kovlar next, but he knew that the city’s walls were guarded with powerful wards that, unlike the ones on Saggorak’s walls, had been kept in good repair. Furthermore, the dragon knew that attacking a dwarven settlement was sure to bring swarms of the annoying bearded pests from throughout the Five Kings Mountains to constantly bother him. It would be better, Veshumirix reasoned, to make the dwarves’ ancestral enemies do his dirty work. And so he set his sights next upon the Darklands, in the hopes of building an army of undead, duergar, and Darklands monsters to take the city on his behalf.</p><p>Recently, the Scarlet Triad has been searching for shards of the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i> themselves—a search that has led them to Veshumirix. Recognizing the danger of both Saggorak and the dragon, Scarlet Triad second-in-command Ilssrah Embermead, a dwarven cleric of Droskar, took it upon herself to secure the shard—and perhaps the aid of the dragon himself. Ilssrah began negotiations with the prideful dragon, promising him slaves and wealth in exchange for the shard, but the dragon was not easily persuaded to part with a relic from his first days. When Ilssrah learned of Veshumirix’s faith, though, she found a more valuable tactic: she told the dragon that her organization had leads on how to release a manifestation of Dahak, and claimed that they would need the shard of the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i> to do so. This promise, combined with the offer of slaves and wealth, convinced the dragon to ally with the Scarlet Triad. As if matters weren’t troubling enough, Ilssrah is also seeking an alliance with local duergar to help bolster her own trade in slaves, and hopes to profit handsomely off Kovlar’s doom if Veshumirix succeeds in devastating the settlement.</p>","_id":"WOybWK5BNv4kGyw8"}

Since she’s joined the coven, Rusty Mae has converted the other hags to the worship of Mahathallah, although Kelleni has begun to doubt these teachings.</p><p>The coven’s original leader, Abelstia, was the one who tried to blockade Dreamgate, triggering a fatal backlash, and ever since, the hags have left both portals alone.

If they’re still unaware of the PCs, the hags and the devil take a –2 penalty to initiative checks for the distraction of their negotiations.</p><p>The two hags react with shrieks of indignation and shock if they’re interrupted and immediately attack, calling upon Kelleni for aid at once (the dissatisfied night hag, if she still lives, takes 1d4 rounds to eventually make her way here). Haznazak is eager to earn an increased price for his services, but not so eager to risk his life for potential employers. He becomes invisible as the fight begins, then telepathically bargains with the hags as the fight unfolds, attempting to drive up his payment in return for aiding the hags in the fight.

Haznazak won’t bargain this price with the PCs, but if the PCs agree (he uses Perception to Sense Motive to try to see through deceptions) he switches sides and attacks the hags instead, much to their rage.

The <i>resurrect</i> ritual has been heavily annotated in Infernal, making it apparent that Rusty Mae has been having problems learning this ritual but that she hopes to use it to bring the coven’s original leader, Abelstia, back to life to replace Kelleni.</p><p>Two <i>dreamstones</i> also rest here—items once used to aid in restful sleep at the way station.

A PC who succeeds at a DC 26 Occultism check recognizes the runes as an attempt to use occult magic to seal a portal. A critical success on this check confirms that the runes are incomplete, and that they seem to have caused a magical backlash that created the scorch mark on the floor—whoever tried to seal the portal with the runes likely paid with their life.</p><p>As soon as the starknife <i>Eclipse</i> is touched to the stone archway, it fades into mist and the runes etched on its once-stone face simply drop to the floor in a powder of dried blood.</p>","_id":"Xc2tJWrDV7zWH7uC"}

An Unseen Hand agent and unflappable scallywag named <b>Whahar</b> (CN male dwarf) leaves the PCs an invitation to meet at the Red Dhabba, an untidy tavern near the docks, to discuss an extraordinary opportunity. Whahar’s waiting for them and has already ordered their favorite drinks; any surprised PC is met with a knowing, gold-toothed smile and “I’ve got my sources.” Whahar gives a few pleasantries before making his case in a hushed voice.</p><blockquote>“Word is that you’re looking for guild support to appeal to the Pactmasters against the Scarlet Triad, yeah? But here, you’re going about it all wrong, see? Why beg for the Pactmasters’ mercy when you could force their hand? I, ah, represent a consortium of esteemed operatives that has more pull with the guilds than your bogeyman, the Scarlet Triad, and that’s help you need. My boss is willing to negotiate the details. Interested?”</blockquote><p>With a successful DC 30 Society or appropriate Lore check, a PC intuits that Whahar’s referencing the Unseen Hand, and the PC knows basic information about the group and their goals. Whahar chuckles if asked about the Unseen Hand, noting only that the PCs’ theory is likely true. Of course, less criminal PCs might consider meeting with the boss of the Unseen Hand as a way to corner Ghost and deliver them to justice, impressing the Pactmasters.</p><p>If the PCs agree, Whahar smiles amicably and insists that his boss doesn’t meet with just anyone; that’s too dangerous. Instead, the PCs need to prove they’re trustworthy, and that means helping out with a quick job. If the PCs are suspicious, Whahar insists that it’s not a particularly dangerous task, just picking up and delivering a package. He asks the PCs to retrieve the package from a merchant called the Seer, and then drop off that package at a local landmark: the Marble Sphinx. If the PCs accomplish this in the next 24 hours, Whahar can secure a meeting and provide his personal recommendation.</p><p><b>The Seer:</b> The marketplace known as the Nightstalls encompasses scores of shops that specialize in deadly, ill-gotten, or morally corrupt wares. Among the merchants there with the longest tenure is <b>the</b><b>Seer</b>(NE male lich), a spell component merchant who keeps covered in a heavy red robe and relies on his eerie reputation and magic to handle overly righteous browsers. At the behest of Whahar, the Seer acquired a trio of sapphires ensorcelled to seem highly magical, when in fact they bear only a modest enchantment. The Seer is no fool; once the gems arrived from his suppliers, he realized they resemble the blue gems used in aluum charms (page 82) and he suspects someone plans to create fake charms. Hoping not to offend the Pactmasters, he cancelled the contract with Whahar and prepared to sell off the gems.</p><p>He still has the gems when PCs arrive at his spiraling tower, and the lich politely welcomes them into the combination library and shop. Once they inquire about the delivery for Whahar, the Seer tersely asserts that the package arrived but the deal is off. If pressed for more detail, he admits the contents threaten his livelihood and business—a point that seems almost absurd, considering his role in the Nightstalls.</p><p>The PCs can convince the Seer otherwise with three successful DC 35 skill checks. Good candidates for skills that could earn the lich’s cooperation are Arcana or Occultism to show that the PCs aren’t ignorant of powerful magic and its consequences; Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation to cajole or trick the Seer into finalizing the transaction; or Society to point out how unlikely it is that he’d be punished for carrying dangerous cargo after so many years of operating in the Nightstalls. If the PCs succeed, the Seer relents, retrieves a small wooden box bearing a heavy lock, and notes that he expects payment to arrive through the usual channels. If the PCs attack the seer, the lich holds up his hands to stop the battle and simply hands over the gems; he has no interest in a fight, but if the PCs persist, you can use the statistics for the lich on page 221 of the <i>Bestiary</i> to represent the Seer.</p><p><b>The Drop Off:</b> Reaching the drop point is straightforward. The Marble Sphinx is one of Katapesh’s largest landmarks, and at night it’s quiet and rarely frequented (due in part to urban legends that it eats passersby). The PCs can easily leave the crystals obtained from the Seer at the appointed place at night.</p><p><b>An Invitation:</b> One day after the PCs complete these tasks, they receive a letter from Whahar. Assuming the PCs accomplished the task with good intentions, he invites them to meet with Ghost the following day in the alley north of the Ibis Fountain in the Lower City at an hour past noon. The letter also encloses a pair of <i>grinning pugwampis</i> (page 77) for the PCs as thanks.</p>","_id":"Xe4OOzVS6oisfFKs"}

Allow the PCs a few tries to start getting the message out, but while this is going on, the Scarlet Triad makes a shocking move. The Scarlet Triad conjurer Barushak Ik-Varashma conjures an ice devil just out of sight of Kite Hill. Barushak instructs the devil to attack the kite-flying PCs and to praise the name of the Umbral Lord and the nation of Nidal as it does so. The Scarlet Triad hopes to stoke the resentment between Kintargo and Nidal, drawing attention away from themselves, and throw the Bellflower Network messaging station into disarray at the same time. Barushak then retreats from Kite Hill, leaving his ice devil to its evil work.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> As soon as the PCs have their kites up high, the ice devil uses its 5th-level <i>dimension door</i> to arrive on Kite Hill only a few dozen feet away. Shrieks fill the air as the ice devil bellows out in Common, “For the Umbral Lord!” and attacks indiscriminately. It utters praises for Nidal and wishes darkness upon Kintargo as it fights. If the PCs don’t intervene, it kills several dozen innocent citizens before vanishing. If the PCs attack the ice devil, it focuses its attacks on them instead. The ice devil fights until slain.</p><p>If Nolly is present, she aids the PCs in the fight against the ice devil. She remains close enough to the PCs to keep them within the range of her inspiring presence and attacks the ice devil with her “hoe.” If the PCs begin to falter, she takes a round to include them in her crop. See page 90 of the Adventure Toolbox for more details on Nolly and her abilities.</p><blockquote><h4>Gelugon - CREATURE 13</h4><br><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 91<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +26</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Nolly Peltry - CREATURE 11</h4><br>Page 90<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +21</blockquote><p><b>Aftermath:</b> Once the fight is over, Nolly thanks the PCs. A successful DC 20 Religion check to Recall Knowledge is enough for a PC to note that it’s unusual for an agent of the Umbral Court to call upon a devil to do their dirty work and not a velstrac (page 82); if no PC hits upon this, Nolly does so herself. She suspects that someone is trying to distract the PCs and authorities alike by capitalizing on the political climate between Ravounel and Nidal. In any event, if the PCs have managed to send their kite-based warning, she thanks them further for their aid there—otherwise, she and the PCs have plenty of time now to send their message.</p><p>At some point during this, a successful DC 15 Perception check is enough for a PC to note a portly halfling man standing nearby, obviously torn between approaching the PCs and Nolly and minding his own business. This halfling man is Kebb, a low-ranking member of the Bellflower Network. He’s got something important to tell Nolly but doesn’t feel comfortable approaching while she’s speaking to strangers. If the PCs don’t point him out, Nolly notices him soon enough and waves him over, explaining that the PCs are friends and that he should speak freely. Kebb bobs his head and then says the following.</p><blockquote>“Nolly, just before all that mayhem, I seen a fella there skulkin’ about on the far side of the hill by some of the trees. Tall human, goldish skin, full beard, red cloak. He had manacles hangin’ from his belt, which put me into the mind that he was two fistfuls of trouble. Then he did some magic, and that bug monster steps out of the thin air. The man and the monster just stared at each other, but I think they was talking with their minds. Then the bug monster popped over onto the hill, raging for blood, and the man took off. I didn’t see where to, Nolly, I’m real sorry about that. But I heard that monster talkin’ like he was workin’ for the Umbral Court, and that man sure didn’t look like no member of no Umbral Court!”</blockquote><p>Kebb has little else to add, and Nolly thanks him for his report before turning to the PCs to ask them what they think. If no PC thinks of it, Nolly suggests heading over to the spot where Kebb saw the man and monster chatting to look for clues. </p><p>On site, a PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Survival check to Track can pick out the ice devil’s prints and the man’s prints. The devil’s tracks are consistent with a creature being summoned on the spot and then using <i>dimension door</i> to reach the hill, but Barushak’s tracks lead elsewhere. While he does know <i>dimension door</i>, he chose to conserve his magic and walk to and from Kite Hill from his quarters in Tanessen Tower. A talented tracker can follow Barushak’s trail back to Tanessen Tower, but doing so is difficult. A PC who succeeds at a DC 22 Survival check to Track follows his trail from the well-trod surface of Kite Hill west to the Night Road, where it’s obvious that the tracks turn south toward the city of Kintargo before stepping onto the road, where the trail is lost. At this point, a DC 35 Survival check to Track is required to continue following the trail on the roads all the way to Tanessen Tower.</p><p>Before the PCs go, Nolly asks for advice. She knows that rumors of a Nidalese devil attacking folks at Kite Hill will soon spread. On one hand, Nolly considers this a good thing, as stirring up public sentiment against Nidal is helpful to the Bellflower Network. But on the other hand, she worries that the attack was a trick designed to throw unearned blame on the Nidalese. Nolly could let people know that Nidal wasn’t actually behind the attack, but if she doesn’t start spreading the message soon, it will be too late. She wants the PCs’ advice on whether to let Nidal take the blame or to insist that Nidal isn’t behind the attack. Nolly spreads whichever message the PCs advise. If the PCs choose to exonerate Nidal, they gain the favor of the Umbral Court later (see Concluding the Adventure on page 57). If the PCs let Nidal take the blame, the Nidalese diplomat Halleka becomes too busy to have any further time for them in this adventure.</p><p><b>XP Reward:</b> If the PCs use the kites to deliver Nolly’s message before defeating the ice devil, award them 20 XP.</p><p>Once the PCs learn that the Scarlet Triad is hiding out in Tanessen Tower (be it by tracking Barushak here, talking to Elianda in area <b>G5</b>, or via Mialari’s prisoners), grant them 80 XP.</p>","_id":"Z60Q7wRRnRIDhxs2"}

In fact, Vaklish is a rakshasa that Laslunn has known for many years. Laslunn knows that Vaklish’s indolence is mostly feigned; the fiend is quick to rouse to ferocious violence if the operations here at the quarry are threatened—such as if the PCs intrude in his room.</p><p>Vaklish usually reclines on the divan here, indulging in mild drugs the poisoners provide him, examining the game board with amusement, and snacking on unsettling victuals. If the PCs intrude with obvious violence, he fights; otherwise, he pretends he’s in a bemused daze and asks the PCs who they are. If the PCs are willing to talk, Vaklish asks them to examine the game board and see whether there is any way for the red pieces to win (a PC who succeeds at a DC 28 Society check or DC 15 Games Lore check can determine that the game, as positioned, must end in a draw). Vaklish already knows there isn’t; he’s merely attempting to get the PCs to come close and lower their guard before he attacks them.</p><p>A PC who attempts the Society check can also attempt a DC 28 Perception check. On a success, the PC notices that the shadows of two of the black pawns seem to waver strangely; a critical success on this Perception check allows the PC to glimpse distorted humanoid shapes forming in those shadows. These two pawns are in fact dormant greater shadows, “crystallized” by Vaklish via one of his latest experiments.</p><p>When a PC replies to Vaklish’s question about who will win the game, he snorts in amusement and says, “Interesting, although you’ve neglected to note an unusual gambit I’m eager to try...” as he seems to reach forward to make a move in the game. He then flips the table, tumbling all of the pieces to the floor and shattering the two shadow figurines. This act allows Vaklish to use Deception to determine his initiative; any PC who noticed something strange with the pawns gains a +4 circumstance bonus to their initiative check.

{"name":"Chiselrock’s Prison(Severe 13)","permission":{"default":0,"amdu4xTh7PPZZgSP":3},"folder":"UDo11YJaXkkebxA3","sort":2800001,"flags":{"importid":"eCyIPn2znJjueNNr"},"content":"<p>When Mountainheart Kolarun Chiselrock threw in his lot with the Scarlet Triad, he knew he would encounter those who needed to be silenced until the politics of Kovlar shifted in his favor. He’d rather not outright execute such people, since he considers that a step too far. Instead, he selected an abandoned masonry warehouse in the Barricade District to serve as a secret prison, and staffed it with corrupt guards he paid well to help keep this secret. Few in Kovlar know what goes on inside this building, but if the truth came out, Chiselrock’s treachery would be laid bare.</p><p>The PCs aren’t required to investigate or even visit Chiselrock’s Prison to eventually defeat Embermead’s plot for Kovlar, but those who do find the site and expose Chiselrock will gain experience, treasures, and resources that will aid their goals. The method by which the PCs come to the prison is not set in stone. They could discover the site after investigating the vanishing of Algret. They might deduce the prison’s use after speaking with some of Chiselrock’s corrupt guards, or even after speaking to Mountainheart himself. And if the PCs find themselves on the wrong side of the law and are arrested—either by Chiselrock’s guards or legitimate city watch, Mountainheart pulls strings to ensure that the captured PCs are sent to his prison (and that all paperwork regarding their arrest is “lost”), in which case the visit to this site becomes a jailbreak scenario.</p><p>Chiselrock’s Prison is a stone building with no windows and a single stone double door barring entrance in its plain facade. From outside, the structure looks dilapidated, but a successful DC 31 Perception check is enough to note that the damage seems largely cosmetic or even artificial. The front door is kept locked (DC 31 Thievery [expert] to Pick the Lock), but all of the corrupt guards carry a key for it. Inside, the building is unlit and sparse, with no furnishings save for portable objects like bedrolls (or piles of straw for prisoners) within. The rooms themselves are detailed briefly in the sidebar on page 29.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> A group of six corrupt guards keep watch over the prison, working in three shifts of two (two on duty in area <b>C1</b>, two resting in area <b>C3</b>, and two patrolling the streets of Kovlar or keeping up the appearances that they’re still legitimate members of the Guild of Arms—these final two guards are unlikely to be encountered in the prison itself). If the PCs attempt to speak to them, the guards pretend to be protecting the site from vandals for an unnamed potential buyer of the warehouse, but they’re not particularly gifted at deception. If the PCs press, the guards relent and allow them into the prison to look around, claiming that they have nothing to hide, but as soon as they seem to have an advantage they ambush the PCs and attempt to capture them alive. Once a guard is slain, the remainder fight to the death, knowing that if they’re captured, things won’t go well for them. If the PCs capture a guard, the guard won’t speak unless they’re either made helpful or Coerced into talking, in which case they give up Chiselrock as the man who hired them.</p><p>If the PCs can rescue her, Algret shares what she knows with the PCs—that she is in fact a spy in the employ of the Guild of Arms who had been charged with investigating possible corruption within the ranks. She followed her clues to this location, only to be set upon by the corrupt guards and imprisoned here. She was so deep undercover that few people even knew she was on the case, and by the time the PCs arrive she’s all but lost hope.</p><h4>Corrupt Guards (4) - Creature 12</h4><p><b>Treasure:</b> A search of area <b>C2</b> reveals enough damning paperwork to reveal Chiselrock’s treachery.</p><p><b>Confronting Mountainheart Chiselrock:</b> Once she’s rescued, Algret goes directly to Commander Hammersong to report as soon as she’s able, providing testimony that’s particularly damning for Mountainheart Chiselrock. Commander Hammersong is horrified to learn what has been going on within his ranks. As a result of Algret’s testimony, all of the guards working with Chiselrock are arrested, and their questioning reveals more damning evidence against Chiselrock. Chiselrock is placed under house arrest, and Algret is placed in charge of the unit of guards supervising him. In addition to conducting their own investigations, the Guild of Arms allows the PCs to question Chiselrock. Chiselrock’s Will save bonus is +25, his Deception bonus is +27, and his Perception bonus is +25. He is initially stubborn and unyielding, but as his plots fall apart, his resolve wavers. He doesn’t know everything about the Scarlet Triad, but you can use him to give the PCs clues as needed to answer questions and help direct them forward to the next part of the adventure.</p><p>When word of Chiselrock’s arrest (or flight after accusations) reaches the streets, tensions in Kovlar rise. Few members of the Stonemasons’ Guild are willing to believe that their leader’s arrest was legitimate. Rumors begin to spread that Commander Hammersong is enacting a plot to impose martial law on the city. Some stonemasons cancel their contracts with the Guild of Arms, and arguments and tavern scuffles become commonplace between the guilds. This tension should largely exist in the background, but also serves to show how significant the disruptions being created by the Scarlet Triad are and emphasizes that these disturbances need to be stopped soon.</p><p><b>Hidden Forge Clues:</b> A search of area <b>C2</b> provides 2 Hidden Forge clues. If the PCs manage to see Chiselrock taken into custody, his desperate attempt to earn mercy reveal enough information that the PCs can locate the Hidden Forge automatically.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs see to it that Chiselrock is taken into custody and removed from office, grant them 120 XP.</p>","_id":"ZqM4CShCZfpfvDmP"}

{"name":"Arrival in Katapesh","permission":{"default":0,"amdu4xTh7PPZZgSP":3},"folder":"qtE0AQH6WLzYv1KX","sort":1900001,"flags":{"importid":"NQsms205PVZwkiW6"},"content":"<p>The sprawling city of Katapesh is the capital of the nation of the same name. Second in size only to Absalom within the Inner Sea region, the city of Katapesh houses 212,300 citizens and is a 13th-level settlement. The map on the inside front cover of this book presents the city at a glance, and the contents of the rest of this chapter and the next provide all the contextual information you’ll need to run this part of the adventure. If you’re looking for more information about Katapesh, however, <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Dark Markets</i> provides a much deeper look into the city.Soon after the PCs arrive in the city, Satla leads them to the Inner City’s Golden Oasis, the last of the city’s surviving oases. After a few minutes’ haggling, Satla secures several rooms and stable space for the PCs and their camels and invites them to rest for whatever lies ahead while she calls on local friends for intelligence. She doesn’t mind if the PCs come along or want to do their own research, and the findings are ultimately the same. Satla gathers the PCs the next morning before they’ve concluded their daily preparations (allowing the PCs to prepare spells afterward); read or paraphrase the following as she reports her findings.</p><blockquote>Satla’s face sags slightly from too little sleep and too much difficult news. “Let’s start with the good news: I’ve learned where Benneb and his associates ended up.” She nods nervously. “All right, that’s all the good news; let’s move on to the bad. The Scarlet Triad abducted them and brought them into Katapesh as slaves. You can’t enslave anyone in the city of Katapesh itself, but anyone enslaved outside and brought in remains a slave by law. Benneb isn’t the only one. The open secret’s that the Scarlet Triad also abducted and enslaved Exavisu Kerndallion, head of Katapesh’s Jewelers’ Guild—sounds like she turned down a morally dubious contract from the Scarlet Triad, and her enslavement is retaliation.”Satla’s voice shakes with anger, but she visibly deflates before continuing. “Worst of all, the Scarlet Triad’s untouchable. I mean, they operate openly out of the Red Pyramid, but because they function as a legal and legitimate consortium—and have done so for decades—they’ve got the Pactmasters’ protection. Attack the Scarlet Triad, and you’ve basically attacked the city. You’re tough, but that’s not a fight you can win.“But we have options. Every month, there’s a Council of Guilds where all of the major trade organizations gather, vote on new policies, punish misdeeds, and revoke charters. That’s our in—if we can disgrace the Scarlet Triad, get their charter revoked, then anything that happens to them is on their heads and the Pactmasters won’t retaliate. Seems simple, right? The trouble’s that nearly all of the guilds currently support the Scarlet Triad, are under their thumb, or don’t want to risk retaliation from them. If we can convince the guilds to stand against the Scarlet Triad, though? At that point, even the Pactmasters would rescind their protection... or maybe even expel the Scarlet Triad entirely.”</blockquote><p>Satla notes that the Council of Guilds traditionally takes place on the last Wealday of the month, so the next one should be on 27 Neth, 3 weeks from now (see Timing this Chapter below if you want to adjust this). She already knows that the Jewelers’ Guild loathes the Scarlet Triad but is held hostage by their beloved leaders’ unjust captivity, and any steps the PCs take to secure Exavisu’s freedom would no doubt earn them that guild’s support. Satla has a possible lead for how to begin, once the PCs are ready. </p><p>Beyond that, Satla’s role is to help keep the PCs on track and remind them of opportunities they might have overlooked. She can provide the PCs an overview of the other major players in Katapesh’s guild politics (see Katapesh’s Guilds on page 20). She also ensures the PCs have a base of operations in the Inner City and keeps an ear to the ground; however, she recognizes they might be able to learn much more about the Scarlet Triad’s stranglehold with enough investigation. In short, she encourages the PCs to move about the city and make the most of the downtime mode of play.</p>","_id":"aRwGmZyB1ZXWzjAL"}

While the floor is bare and smooth and the thirty-foot-high ceiling is plain and unadorned, the walls of the chamber look like bulging stone bubbles that have extruded out of the rectangular chamber’s four corners, each of which is visible high above the protruding walls. These four hemispherical stone surfaces bear strange ripples, as if they were once molten but have since hardened. A single six-inch-diameter circular window opens halfway up each dome, not quite fifteen feet above the ground, to reveal that these stone bubbles are hollow within.</blockquote><p>This room was once a servants’ quarters, but the gug savant Xevalorg has repurposed and reshaped it, creating four rounded prison chambers using <i>stone shape</i>. He uses this same magic to occasionally reopen these prisons long enough to add new prisoners. The prison walls are made of 1-foot-thick stone, with a 6-inch-wide window at the gug’s eye level, wide enough for gugs to peer into but not wide enough for prisoners to escape.</p><p>The gugs love the taste of ghast flesh, but they maintain a primal fear of ghouls. Instead of relying entirely on hunting for their undead meals, this group of gugs has begun to “farm” ghasts. When they fight powerful humanoids, they attempt to capture them alive rather than killing them. They then allow their “weird” ghast prisoner in the northeastern cell to bite these unconscious victims before placing them in another chamber to wait for ghast fever to run its course, after which the gugs devour the newly created ghasts.</p><p>Of the four cells here, the southern two hold remnants of devoured bones, dried bloodstains, and old excrement. The northwestern cell contains the bloated forms of two recently slain duergar who succumbed to ghast fever, and who will arise as new ghasts at midnight (at which point they’ll likely be eaten by the gugs). The final cell contains an undead prisoner.</p><p><b>Creature:</b> The sound of simpering and mewling cries from the window into the northeastern cell may make the PCs think that the person imprisoned within is a distraught human, when in fact the sound comes from a starving ghast. Once a human adventurer from the surface world, the story of how he ended up deep below ground in the Darklands as a ghast is a tragic tale that he’s gone to great lengths to forget. The prisoner has even forgotten his own name and now goes by the name Deadmouth. While he has little interest in his past, he’s eager to escape his current predicament. He knows that the gugs kept him around at first as a curiosity (the gugs, far more used to stocky dwarven undead, found his lanky frame strange and curious), but now that he’s being kept as a source of “not-so-fresh meat,” Deadmouth has increasingly grown bored and desperate for freedom. Of course, he’s still a ravenous and sadistic eater of flesh, and PCs who feel sorry enough to rescue and release him should keep this in mind. Should a PC take it upon themselves to destroy and resurrect Deadmouth, feel free to have his memories return and perhaps reveal himself to be someone from your campaign whose mysterious disappearance has long intrigued historians—or simply have him be a grateful man who is forever in debt to the PCs for his new life.</p><p>The gugs rarely feed Deadmouth, and he sustains himself on the bites they allow him to take out of captured prisoners, facilitating their transformation into ghasts. If Deadmouth notices the PCs, he attempts to negotiate with them, though his hunger makes it challenging for him to focus unless the PCs offer a meal (such as one of the corpses in the nearby cells). If the PCs don’t want to give Deadmouth a corpse to feast upon, coaxing Deadmouth into focusing requires a PC to succeed at a DC 28 Diplomacy check.</p><p>If the PCs feed him or otherwise get him to focus, Deadmouth can tell the PCs a bit of lore about Saggorak—including the fact that this is where the PCs are now located, in the event that they’ve not yet figured this out. Deadmouth doesn’t reveal any information that he believes could endanger the undead citizens of Saggorak; he instead brags that their king, Veshumirix, is a dragon born from the heart of the hottest volcano. Furthermore, Deadmouth tells the PCs that even if they survive for a few days against Saggorak’s ravenous dead, they shouldn’t expect to be able to survive a confrontation with the so-called “Molten King.” He tells the PCs that if they know what’s good for them, they’ll “hide behind Kovlar’s walls, like the rest of the heart-beating fleshlings there.”</p><blockquote><h4>Deadmouth - CREATURE 2</h4><br>Male ghast<i> (Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 169)<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +8</blockquote><p><b>Treasure:</b> Among the duergar bodies in the northwestern cell is a <i>mummified bat</i> talisman.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs learn about Veshumirix from Deadmouth, grant them 40 XP.</p>","_id":"axDTiyVzKs5dNtSL"}

Finding easy prey in Finderplain, which is far from most powerful defenders, it cajoled several uthul allies to help perform the ritual that has inflicted the destructive dust storm paralyzing the area. It has sent its uthul minions into the town to torment villagers and to maintain the storm, while it circles the region and eagerly awaits chances to target lone fools who venture out into the dust. In time, the Weathered Wail will target the PCs themselves, but for now the dust wendigo prefers to operate in the background and let its uthuls play.</p><p>As the PCs explore Finderplain, the Weathered Wail descends to a nearby home to hunt. The creature uses Howl while out of sight, affecting the PCs and driving the three gnomes and one half-elf inside into a blind panic. They burst from their shelter, screaming in terror as they run down the street, just visible to the PCs through a break in the dust storm. At the same time, three opportunistic uthuls converge on the fleeing creatures. This combat takes place along one of the thoroughfares with the PCs approximately 50 feet away from the fleeing humanoids, and the uthuls in between, approximately 30 feet from those fleeing. Several 15-foot-wide dust dunes in the street and between homes act as difficult terrain, and the brutal winds and dust inhibit sight and flight (page 10).</p><p>These uthuls are composed of swirling clouds of dust-laden wind. Their coloration tends towards brown and red from the dust in their bodies rather than the more usual blue and gray, but they still churn with violent wind and lightning. They delight in savaging victims, though they quickly turn their attention to the PCs if attacked. Assuming the PCs engage the uthuls within a round of the combat starting, they divert the monsters’ attention to themselves and save the gnomes and half-elf. It takes the four of these refugees 1d4+1 rounds to reach safety, and during any of those rounds, if any uthul isn’t attacked by a PC, one of the four gnomes is slain (regardless of how many uthuls aren’t attacked). In any event, as combat begins, the uthuls make surging, howling advances as they gust through and over buildings, using Acrobatics to determine their initiative.</p><blockquote><h4>Uthuls (3) - CREATURE 14</h4><br><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 317<br><b>Initiative</b> Acrobatics +29</blockquote><p><b>XP Award:</b> For each of the four victims who lives to the end of this encounter, award the PCs an additional 20 XP, to a maximum of 80 XP if all four live.</p>","_id":"bBIWQUgmQLWF2Jmk"}

For the remainder of this extended social encounter, the PCs have the chance to earn the favor of some or all of these leaders. Gaining the trust of each leader gives the PCs a new lead for them to investigate in the city, and if the PCs can earn the favor of a majority of the regents, the regents will grant the party additional treasures and support to aid their quests.</p><p>The meeting progresses as ten individual roleplaying encounters with a few guiding principles. As each regent addresses the PCs, they’ll ask a single question about the PCs’ goals, traditions, and personalities. This encounter should give the PCs a chance to vocalize their group’s intentions. Kelda addresses the PCs first, but after this, the order in which the dwarves speak is left to you. Each interview consists of two phases, as summarized below—the specialized actions the PCs can take during both phases are detailed as well. Make sure the players are familiar with how these actions work before proceeding with the encounter!</p><p><b>Question:</b> The regent introduces themselves to the PCs by name and their guild (for example: “I am Forgemaster Kelda Halrig of the Anvillers’ Guild”), gives a quick summary of the guild’s role in Kovlar’s society, and then presents the group with a question meant to reveal each party member’s goals, moral fiber, and personality. As each dwarf introduces themselves and poses their question to the party, each PC gets 1 action, which they can use to Deduce Traditions associated with the dwarven leader’s guild. The PCs have just a moment to share this information with one another before they’re expected to give their responses.</p><p><b>Response:</b> Each PC then gets 1 action—a chance to reply to the question to prove their worth and earn the regent’s favor by each taking an Influence Regent action. The dwarven regents aren’t interested in listening to PCs talking over each other, and they ask the PCs to take turns responding. Not every PC is required to speak—a PC can opt to remain silent rather than risk potentially damaging the party’s progress. Also, a PC can spend their time vouching for someone else, preparing to Aid that other PC. They must still remain silent when their ally speaks, but their ally applies the bonus or penalty from Aid anyway. Note that if a PC gets a critical success when Deducing Traditions, the party discovers that regent’s Skepticism value and thus will know if they’ve managed to earn that regent’s favor rather than having to wait until judgment.</p><p><b>Judgment:</b> Each of the regents the PCs interact with in this adventure has a Skepticism score. If the PCs manage to reduce this value to 0 with their responses, the regent is impressed and declares their trust in the party. If the PCs fail to reduce the regent’s Skepticism to 0, the regent regretfully announces they do not trust the party. Those who start with a Skepticism of 0 will support the party unless the PCs make terrible mistakes.</p><blockquote><h4>Deduce Traditions [one-action]</h4><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">CONCENTRATE</span><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">LINGUISTIC</span><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">SECRET</span><br>By interpreting a regent’s personality, drawing upon what you know about dwarven tradition, and making educated guesses, you surmise what sorts of skills are most valued by the dwarven regent’s guild—and thus infer what types of skills would most likely curry that regent’s favor.

This second tactic usually can’t succeed unless that skill is one favored by that regent’s guild. At the GM’s option, you may substitute an applicable Lore skill check for the Diplomacy check. If you attempt a Diplomacy or Lore check, it’s a DC 32 check for success; if you attempt a favored skill check, it’s a DC 28 check for success.At the GM’s option, a player who brings up a compelling point or roleplays particularly well in their attempt to Influence a Regent might gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.<br><b>Critical Success</b> You reduce the regent’s Skepticism by 2.<br><b>Success</b> You reduce the regent’s Skepticism by 1.<br><b>Failure</b> You do not adjust the regent’s Skepticism.<br><b>Critical Failure</b> You increase the regent’s Skepticism by 1.</blockquote><p><h3>The Regents</h3>Each regent, other than Kelda Halrig, is skeptical about the value a group of surface-dwelling adventurers can bring to solving Kovlar’s troubles. The ten regents are presented individually below, each with their guild’s name and favored skills. After this, a few notes on the regent’s personality are given to aid you in roleplaying that character—this section also indicates what sorts of PC personalities might make earning that regent’s trust more difficult. After this, the regent’s query is listed; they pose this query to the PCs and judge their responses.</p><p>Each regent has a Skepticism value. Each PC can succeed at an Influence Regent action to reduce this value. Skepticism can’t be reduced below 0, and thus it is possible for a poor roll at the end of the party’s response to increase it back to 1. If the PCs haven’t discovered a regent’s Skepticism value via a critical success at Deducing Traditions, they should take care with deciding who in the party speaks. Wise parties start with their poorest speakers (or have those speakers pass) and end with their strongest, so as to minimize potential gaffes.</p><p>Finally, the regent’s lead is listed—this is a specific encounter or investigation or clue that the PCs can then follow up in Kovlar to start uncovering the influence of the Scarlet Triad in the region. A regent reveals their lead only to a party they trust (when the regent’s Skepticism value is 0). At your option, the PCs can learn about leads otherwise lost to them (by failing to earn a regent’s trust) as a reward or discovery made later in this chapter.</p><blockquote><h4>Forgemaster Kelda Halrig</h4><br>LN female dwarf<br><b>Faction</b> Anvillers’ Guild<br><b>Favored Skills</b> Arcana, Athletics, or Crafting<br><b>Personality</b> Forgemaster Halrig is dutiful, honest, and forthright.

Morally flexible at best, the members of the Lacunafex are not held to any code other than utmost secrecy. Despite her group’s shady exploits, she’s one of Kintargo’s most influential citizens.</p><p>A PC who succeeds at a DC 22 Society check knows that Lady Docur’s School for Girls was founded by Lady Mialari Docur, and that it is now a haven for half-elves of wealthy but not aristocratic backgrounds. Its curriculum is considered exceptional in language arts, world history, and music, but also quirky and somewhat impractical. A critical success on that Society check is enough to have heard rumors of the school’s secret connection to a spy network called the Lacunafex.The three Scarlet Triad thugs dispatched to eliminate the Bellflower Network safe house at Lady Docur’s School for Girls got much more than they bargained for: Mialari and her girls handily captured them. Mialari is still considering her interrogation options when the PCs arrive at her school. When they do, read or paraphrase the following.</p><blockquote>The curiously shaped building is made of Kintargo’s typical silver-streaked pale stone but is covered with sinuous carvings of vines, trees, and flowers. Narrow windows punctuate these carvings, adding to the distinct look in a way that invokes elven architecture. Five doors shaped like narrow gothic arches form the building’s entrance.</blockquote><p>Ornate letters, carved above the doors in both Elven and Common read “Lady Docur’s School for Girls.” Each door has an additional label, written in both languages reading, from north to south: “Deliveries,” “Parents,” “Pupils,” “Instructors,” and “Visitors.” A braided, silver cord hangs next to each door—if pulled, a soft chime sounds somewhere within.</p><p>A well-dressed half-elf woman named Arlethi Soumaila answers whichever bell the PCs ring, but if the PCs ring any bell other than that for visitors, she glares at them peevishly. In any case, Arlethi leads the PCs to an octagonal sitting room with comfortable divans and fragile tables laden with refreshments. She invites the PCs to help themselves and politely asks their business. To nearly any response, Arlethi insists on fetching the headmistress, Lady Docur. </p><p>Arlethi is only gone a few moments when Mialari makes her entrance. Read or paraphrase the following.</p><blockquote>Flanked by two tall, half-elf girls, the graceful woman is the image of elven elegance. Dressed in flowing silken robes with a delicate pattern of grapevines, she sports an elaborate silver diadem atop smooth, scarlet hair that falls past her waist. Stepping noiselessly in delicate slippers, her hands clasped, she nods politely. “When troubles come, they come not singly,” she remarks with a slight smile. “How can we help you?”</blockquote><p>If the PCs are forthright about their pursuit of Scarlet Triad agents and generally polite to Mialari, she is disposed to work with them (or, as she sees it, to allow the PCs to do her dirty work). If the PCs are rude or evasive, Mialari quickly loses her patience and asks the PCs to depart until they can return with a clearer request or better manners. Regardless, securing her trust is a difficult task, requiring a PC to succeed at a DC 30 Diplomacy check (with a critical success needed if the PCs were sent away with a command to return with better manners).</p><p>If the PCs have already sent warnings from Kite Hill, Nolly’s sent along advance word to Mialari to vouch for them, in which case she trusts them automatically.</p><p><b>XP Reward:</b> Once the PCs earn Mialari’s trust, grant them 40 XP. With enough time, they can also learn the Lacunafex spells and feats found on pages 73–74.</p>","_id":"ey0arIN2BVgVRfRR"}

Additional details on Kintargo appear on pages 62–63 of the Ravounel Gazetteer in this volume, but if you’re looking for more information to expand encounters in this chapter, see the Hell’s Rebels Adventure Path, which takes place entirely in this so-called “Silver City.”Kintargo’s citizens have a lot on their minds, particularly when it comes to the ongoing diplomatic talks with Nidal or recent sightings of strange apparitions associated with the rebellion in the city streets and alleys. Some of Kintargo’s citizens hope to develop a relationship with Nidal that enriches the city, while others fear that the Umbral Court is making preliminary moves to annex or assault Ravounel. Most people, however, simply don’t know what to think at this early point in the political development. The recurring reports of mysterious hauntings include stories of ghostly hell hounds, echoes of somber bells, and even visions of Barzillai Thrune, the tyrant who ruled Kintargo for a short time. Many fear that Barzillai himself may have risen from the grave; this citywide dread isn’t exactly helping the diplomatic talks with Nidal, and all the combined unrest has made it much easier for the Scarlet Triad to operate from the shadows and establish a black market slave trade in Ravounel.As a result, few citizens have heard any rumors about slavers or an organization called the Scarlet Triad; the profile of the organization simply hasn’t risen high enough to be noticed among the city’s other concerns. News of the assault on Cypress Point will eventually reach the city, however, and when it does, the city’s Silver Council sends investigators to check up on the situation there.

This archway is studded with gems and decorated with carvings of panthers. Along one wall, a row of bookcases and a wooden desk remain in prime condition, oblivious to the weight of years. A long-dead skeleton sits slumped in a chair at the desk. The soft sound of muffled sobbing and wailing wafts through the air.</blockquote><p>The sobbing and wailing sounds come from the crystals that glow and shimmer along the side of the way station opposite its entrance from Alseta’s Ring—a successful DC 20 Perception check is all that’s required to pinpoint the crystals as the source of the wailing. The necromantic magic in the crystals has only grown in power over time, and their magic triggers as soon as any living creature approaches within 20 feet—see Hazard on page 9.</p><p><b>Creature:</b> Talamira still exists in this chamber, spending the majority of her time at the desk studying her notes or milling among the crystals, examining their facets and listening to their song. Now a ghost, the unfortunate elf has no capacity to fabricate new memories, nor does she comprehend that she is undead. She no longer attempts to turn pages in her journal, gather samples from crystals, or otherwise directly interact with the physical world. She’s trapped in the moment before making such a decision, always intending to turn that page, gather that sample, or attempt to contact the outside world for advice, but never quite reaching the point of decision, as she forgets her intention to do so before she can act on it.</p><p>Talamira is a tragic figure, but she’s also potentially dangerous if the PCs react poorly to her appearance. When she notices visitors to the way station, she rises up from her remains, appearing as she did in life (albeit in ghostly form) and floats forward toward the PCs, holding out her arms in welcome as she greets the visitors in Elven, welcoming them to Jewelgate and warning them that the far side of the portal is dangerous.</p><p>Talamira fights only if she is attacked—in this case, she fights until destroyed, as her condition of living purely in the moment prevents her from recalling a time when she wasn’t fighting against the intruding PCs. If the PCs can establish communication with her and don’t fight, her repeated welcomes to the way station should quickly reveal to the PCs that something strange is going on with her mind. If a PC starts to approach the crystals, her expression changes to fear and she warns them not to approach the dangerous crystals. Should the PCs activate the wailing crystals, Talamira wails and howls in pain and anguish as she relives her own death at the hazard over and over, reverting to her welcoming posture if the PCs retreat from the crystals without deactivating the hazard.</p><p>As long as the wailing crystals aren’t active, the PCs can attempt to speak to Talamira. Doing so is difficult, since she doesn’t recall questions much longer than it takes to ask them. She can effectively answer questions only if they are asked with a single simple sentence, and she answers in similarly short sentences. You can use Talamira to reveal to the PCs some of the history of Alseta’s Ring as you wish, to warn them of the crystals and the serpentfolk threat in the caves beyond (even though the serpentfolk are long gone, the caves remain dangerous), or even to provide hints as to how she can be laid to rest.</p><p>Talamira grows agitated if confronted with her undead nature. She doesn’t seem to be able to sense her own remains, but any attempt to convince her that she is a ghost or to ask her how she can be put to rest requires a successful DC 36 Diplomacy check. On a success, she seems momentarily confused and then reverts to her welcomes, forgetting the question entirely. On a critical success she grows morose and says, “The crystals snuffed me out, and now they keep me here forever!” before reverting to welcomes. On a failure, she wails and cries out in anguish, unintentionally activating her resonant wail ability before she reverts to welcomes. On a critical failure, she wails, cries, and then attacks in a murderous rage, fighting until destroyed. Any attempt to disturb her remains or steal from her belongings at the desk also risks enraging her. When someone starts to take such an action, she cries out in warning—should the PC persist in the action, she attacks as well, using Telekinetic Crystalline Assault to blast the PCs with razor-sharp shards of crystals before moving on to cast spells or wail.</p><h4>Talamira - Creature 13</h4><p><b>Hazard:</b> Candlaron originally harvested several vibrant crystals from the other side of Jewelgate and cultivated them here, never anticipating that the serpentfolk would be able to use that fact to infect Jewelgate. When the serpentfolk transformed the crystals on the far side into dangerous crystalline husks (see area <b>A1</b>), that necromantic energy seeped across the planar boundaries into the crystals growing here, transforming them into an even more dangerous hazard.</p><h4>Wailing Crystals - Hazard 13</h4><p><b>Treasure:</b> Talamira’s preservative magic has kept the books in this room in pristine condition. Several volumes on evocation magic are open on the desk, all written in Elven. Among the volumes on the bookshelves, the PCs can find several tomes filled with Talamira’s research notes regarding the nature of <i>aiudara</i>—those of Alseta’s Ring in particular. These texts can fill in PCs on the history of Alseta’s Ring if they missed the chance to learn this from Talamira herself. The collection of ancient texts includes original copies of ancient elven philosophical treatises, as well as various works of arcane theory thought lost. Perhaps most importantly, these books contain information about a tradition of magic that has been all but lost to elven society—the practices of the crystal keeper. A PC who studies and references these texts gains access to the crystal keeper archetype (page 74). In all, the books in Talamira’s library would sell for 500 gp to an interested buyer. The books all together are 20 Bulk.</p><p>In addition, tucked among the books are two scrolls: a <i>scroll of dimensional lock</i> and a <i>scroll of tongues</i>.</p><p><b>Exiting the Way Station:</b> Activating the archway to pass through Jewelgate is straightforward. The PCs need only touch the <i>Eye of the Wise</i> to the stone arch, allowing them to pass through into area <b>A1</b> of the Crystal Tunnels.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs manage to put Talamira’s ghost to rest, award them XP as if they had defeated her in combat.</p>","_id":"g60VQnWCZ09rp7xQ"}

Unable to personally recruit the influx of new talent needed for his Glorious Endeavor, he sought others who could search the world for him. An answer came in the form of the Scarlet Triad, a group of merchants based in Katapesh with the skills and infrastructure needed to serve the role of scout for the Endeavor. For decades the Scarlet Triad did just that, continuing to operate under the cover of a merchant’s guild while each year transporting at least a dozen exceptional and willing individuals to Hermea. Only Katapesh’s enigmatic Pactmasters had an inkling of the Scarlet Triad’s true purpose, and a combination of professional courtesy and financial kickbacks ensured they never looked too deeply into the operation.However, as Promise’s population grew, Mengkare’s need for new blood dwindled. Gradually he scaled back his support for the Scarlet Triad, asking for fewer and fewer recruits each year. Yet the organization had grown accustomed to decades of wealth, so in 4690 ar, its newest leader, Uri Zandivar, made a bold decision to apply the Scarlet Triad’s headhunting skills to a new trade: slavery. With Uri’s sister Emaliza serving on Mengkare’s council, he found it easy to work with her to keep the Scarlet Triad’s role as slavers hidden from the dragon. For nearly 30 years the Scarlet Triad’s success has balanced on a knife’s edge, for Zandivar knows that behind Mengkare’s unflinchingly pragmatic methodology is a dragon who abhors enslavement—both from his two encounters with the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i> and on moral principle. Likewise, Zandivar knows that Mengkare’s an extraordinarily powerful dragon who doesn’t hesitate to incinerate those he considers traitors or morally bankrupt. Fortunately for Uri, the Scarlet Triad has nearly completed two different tools to discourage Mengkare in the event that he ever learns of their exploits. First, the Scarlet Triad has used its wealth and connections to secure over half of the shards of the destroyed <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i> (most recently a shard once owned by the magma dragon Veshumirix), which the operation’s experts have nearly repaired into a functional version of the original artifact. Second, the Scarlet Triad has secured many of the portal keys connected to Alseta’s Ring. By attuning the gates carefully, Uri Zandivar and his lieutenants believe they can release the cataclysmic spirit of Dahak within and leverage this threat of mutual self-destruction to keep Mengkare at bay.</p><p>Recently, though, two developments have put the Scarlet Triad’s operations in peril. With the abolition of slavery in several nations in recent years (including Absalom, Ravounel, and Vidrian), many of the Scarlet Triad’s most important clients have been driven from the trade and markets are closed. And perhaps more concerning are the PCs, who have been systematically claiming the portal keys to Alseta’s Ring and defeating minor leaders in the Scarlet Triad’s organization. With his two favored subcommanders Laslunn and Ilssrah out of commission and the portal keys they protected lost to the PCs, Uri feels increasingly cornered.

They’ve already stolen anything of value from the crates here, and smashed up another few crates just for fun. </p><p>Tall stacks of chests and larger goods surround the southeast corner of the warehouse (area <b>F5</b>), which the Scarlet Triad has been using as a torture chamber. Double doors to the south lead to Sunset Imports’ private piers in Yolubilis Harbor, double doors to the northeast lead out of the building but are locked, and other doors lead to the showroom (area F1) and the hallway (area F2).</p><p><b>Crate Columns:</b> The columns of crates in the warehouse are solidly stacked, but the squares marked with an “X” on the map can be toppled with a hearty shove. A PC who succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check notices these unstable crates (and the resulting opportunity) at a glance.

The golem is carved to resemble a blocky humanoid with an enormous headdress and a round face like a calendar stone. The Scarlet Triad’s most talented spellcaster, Barushak Ik-Varashma, activated the golem and compelled it to serve as a guard. The golem attacks any creatures that don’t speak a pass phrase (“foes in chains or in the ground”) while in its presence. Once activated, the golem simply smashes through stacks of crates to get at the PCs with its fists, obliterating columns of crates the PCs might otherwise attempt to topple onto it.

Hundy further overheard that the Scarlet Triad agents plan to rendezvous somewhere else in town after their raids on the Bellflower Network sites, as they feel their activities here at the Sunset Imports warehouse have become too visible. Hundy doesn’t have any clue where this new hideout might be.</p><p>The PCs can visit the endangered Bellflower Network sites in any order, but should go to Kite Hill first—if the PCs don’t send warnings from Kite Hill, some of the NPCs they might encounter at Long Roads Coffeehouse or Lady Docur’s School may be less receptive or even dead.</p><p><b>Kite Hill:</b> Hundy knows Kite Hill is a very public venue, and that there’s a kite-flying event happening there today orchestrated by Nolly Peltry, the Bellflower Network leader in Kintargo. Hundy asks the PCs to travel there first and warn Nolly of the Scarlet Triad, and that they may strike at her at any moment. If the PCs agree to travel there first, Hundy goes with them to help make sure Nolly trusts them. They can then use kites to send warnings quickly across Kintargo, for agents of the Bellflower Network use them to communicate over long distances.</p><p><b>Long Roads Coffeehouse:</b> Long Roads Coffeehouse is a famous cafe owned by Laria Longroad, a public figure and secret Bellflower agent. Hundy revealed as much to the Scarlet Triad, and he asks the PCs to pay a visit to the coffeehouse as soon as they alert Nolly so that Laria can be warned to go into hiding.</p><p><b>Lady Docur’s School for Girls:</b> This is a private boarding school whose headmistress is a secret ally of the Bellflower Network. Lady Docur herself is a talented spellcaster with a knack for spotting shenanigans and criminal activities, and she and her students are in no real danger from the Scarlet Triad, but Lady Docur might not trust the PCs unless they’ve already traveled to Kite Hill and gained an introduction from Nolly Peltry.</p>","_id":"hPBR3jyMytQcxFWC"}

Three piers, each running perpendicular to the building and jutting into Yolubilis Harbor, make for convenient loading and unloading of goods from boats directly into the warehouse. The interior of Sunset Imports is well-lit with sturdy lanterns. Ceilings are 25 feet high throughout.For all its welcoming appearance, Sunset Imports is relatively empty. No boats are anchored at the private piers and no customers or workers enter or exit the building. In fact, only one employee is currently on site: the business’s owner, <b>Sedranni Vashnarstill</b>(LN female human importer). Her family has had significant difficulty replacing the canceled House Thrune contract, and now Sedranni has grown desperate. She authorized her agents to begin dealing with the Scarlet Triad in Katapesh and other Garundi ports, but she had no idea what a viper’s nest the organization would prove to be. The Scarlet Triad has used Sunset Imports for increasingly unsavory activities, most recently engaging in outright slave trade and torture from her piers. Sedranni has moved from scandalized and frustrated to downright terrified. The Scarlet Triad has made it clear that their operations must remain a secret or they’ll sink Sedranni’s corpse in the harbor and ruin the Vashnarstill name with implications of illegal business. Sedranni has been commanded to keep the shop open—as its prolonged closure might draw suspicion—but to prevent anyone from passing through the showroom. The frightened Sedranni has little recourse but to obey.</p><p>The main doors at the building’s west end, leading into the showroom (area <b>F1</b>), are the only doors currently open.

The Scarlet Triad considered these old dormitories ideal for prisoner storage, and they have divided their prisoners up among four of the five dormitories here. The moans and cries of prisoners in pain are plainly audible through the doors to areas <b>H3b</b>, <b>H3c</b>, and particularly <b>H3d</b>, through which cruel guffaws and taunts can also be heard. The doors to these three rooms and area <b>H3e</b> are all locked with newly fitted padlocks, but the padlock on the door to area <b>H3d</b>hangs open. When locked, opening one of these doors requires four DC 25 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or a DC 30 Athletics check to Force Open; alternatively, the locks can be opened by a key—one of the thugs in area <b>H3d</b> carries such a key, while Barushak carries the other. While it’s faster to Force Open a door, doing so is much louder and certainly attracts the attention of the floor’s denizens (see Creatures on page 43). See Talking to the Prisoners on page 45 for details on what they have to say once Barushak and his minions no longer threaten them.</p><p><b>Area H3b:</b> This dormitory’s sole living prisoner is a woman named <b>Jerrina Stapwell</b> (CG female human scholar). She’s manacled to a bed next to a dead human man—another prisoner who succumbed to injuries inflicted by the Scarlet Triad when he tried to escape. Jerrina is normally quite level headed, but being shackled next to a corpse has made her terror stricken. She pleads with the PCs to free her as soon as she realizes they are there.</p><p><b>Area H3c:</b> This dormitory contains six malnourished stevedores, each of them manacled to empty bed frames. These prisoners are laborers for Sunset Imports, and they have been in Scarlet Triad custody for several weeks. The stevedores were captured for their strength, so the Scarlet Triad has been weakening them by withholding food and administering debilitating poisons to make them less likely to burst free. They weakly beg the PCs for freedom and food.</p><p><b>Area H3d</b>: Another five stevedores are kept here (similar to those in area <b>H3c</b>), but they’re currently being tormented by a pair of Scarlet Triad thugs (see Creatures below).</p><p><b>Area H3e:</b> Not all of the prisoners have fallen into despair—those who were kept in this final room have managed to escape their bonds. Abducted from Long Roads Coffeehouse, these four halflings are led by Laria Longroad. Now that they’ve escaped their bonds, the halflings are quietly ripping up moldering bedclothes and sheets into long strips which they intend to braid into a rope for escape out the window. Should the PCs interrupt their work (by either entering the room or starting a noisy fight elsewhere on the floor), the halflings’ first instinct is to hide. Laria can pass on additional information; see Talking with the Prisoners on page 45.</p><p><b>Area H3f:</b> This dorm room has been somewhat refurnished to be more comfortable, for it is here that the Scarlet Triad conjurer, Barushak Ik-Varashma, resides, along with a trio of evangelist velstracs—extraplanar guardians he’s recently conjured.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> A total of five foes dwell on this floor—two Scarlet Triad thugs (Otto Khauf and “Billyclub” Clavin), the conjurer Barushak, and his three velstrac minions. If survivors of a fight on a lower floor have fled here to raise an alarm, they and the thugs and the velstracs confront the PCs in area <b>H3a</b> after Barushak gives the PCs a choice (see below). Otherwise, the thugs are busy tormenting prisoners in area <b>H3d</b> while Barushak studies one of his grimoires in area <b>H3f</b> and his velstracs stand quietly by.In area <b>H3d</b>, the two thugs have challenged the five prisoners kept therein: any prisoner who can hit one of the thugs hard enough to knock them over goes free. The thugs have the odds severely stacked in their favor, of course, as the prisoners are feeble from malnourishment and abuse, and the thugs are eager to dole out more beatings to anyone who tries to strike them and fails to knock them over. This is all a fun game to the thugs, who don’t intend to release anyone anyway. The thugs’ diversions make them unlikely to notice any combat outside the room, or even anyone attempting to pick the lock on this door—they take a –4 circumstance penalty to Perception checks. When they realize they have intruders, however, they immediately attack, moving out into area <b>H3a</b> if possible to raise the alarm and call upon Barushak for aid.</p><p>Barushak is a tall Keleshite man with a full beard. Having been given the opportunity to advance his position in the Scarlet Triad by serving Laslunn in Ravounel, he’s eager to defeat the PCs and claim that glory for himself—but wary about risking all his hard work. When he casts <i>summon fiend</i> as a 6th-level spell, he prefers to summon an evangelist velstrac, and he summons a bearded devil when casting the spell at 5th level, a hell hound for 4th level, and—if it comes to it—an augur velstrac for 2nd or 3rd level. While sustaining a summoned fiend’s presence, he switches to various ranged damage spells. If reduced to 25 or fewer HP, he uses <i>dimension door</i> to escape and flees south to Laslunn. He can be encountered again with her in area <b>J11</b>.</p><h4>Barushak Il-varashma - Creature 11</h4><blockquote><h4>Scarlet Triad Thugs (2) - CREATURE 7</h4><br>Page 16<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +13</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Evangelist Velstracs (3) - CREATURE 6</h4><br>Page 83<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +13</blockquote><p><b>Treasure:</b> Barushak keeps two valuable objects in area <b>H3f</b>. One of these is a <i>greater skeleton key</i> which he used to unlock several of the doors in the tower but now has little further use for. The other is a black metal <i>moderate thurible of revelation</i>inscribed with Infernal text. But he keeps his most valuable object, his arcane focus, on his person; this is a book called <i>The Extraplanar Registry</i>, and it is written in Infernal. Anyone who can read it can use this detailed tome to gain a +2 item bonus to Recall Knowledge about outsiders, but it has a greater value—contained within its pages are full details on three rituals: <i>commune</i>, <i>imprisonment</i>, and <i>planar ally</i>. <i>The Extraplanar Registry</i> is worth 1,500 gp.</p><p>Among the treasure, several pages of notes written in Infernal not only detail Barushak’s plans to besmirch the Nidalese diplomats with propaganda, but also explain how the rakshasas managed to “draw upon the latent traumas of this city” to manifest undead shades of Barzillai. It’s clear that Barushak is impressed with this occult magic, even if he doesn’t quite understand how the rakshasas managed it. These notes, if presented to the Silver Council, will help to ensure that the peace talks with Nidal continue, and the notes are among the more important documents the PCs can obtain to ensure a greater reward—see Concluding the Adventure on page 57 for details.</p>","_id":"hsA3XJAQ8NAy9fSq"}

Its proprietor, a halfling woman named Laria Longroad, managed to keep Long Roads Coffeehouse’s role in the network a secret through all of the rebellion, only to have Hundy spill the proverbial beans to the Scarlet Triad. As a result, the Scarlet Triad launches an attack on the eatery during the busy lunch rush, choosing the coffeehouse to try out the second stage of their mastery over the remnants of Barzillai Thrune. When two of the rakshasas working with the Triad, disguised as unassuming customers, infiltrated the coffeehouse and called up two remnants of Barzillai, chaos broke out in the building. Laria managed to save several of her customers from the attack, but she was overwhelmed and captured. The attack itself was swift and brutal, occurring only a few minutes before the PCs arrive at Long Roads Coffeehouse, so the authorities have not yet been alerted to the event.</p><p>The PCs have no trouble finding the coffeehouse. When they arrive, read or paraphrase the following.</p><blockquote>A short flight of stairs leads to the double doors of a handsome two-and-a-half-story wood and stone building. The doors currently swing awkwardly loose, one of them damaged. Two broken chairs lie sprawled on the front stairs, which are smeared with what could be food or something fouler. Overturned tables are visible through the front windows. The smell of blood, cardamom, and coffee wafts down the stairs, along with the sound of muffled banging.</blockquote><p>The main door is the most obvious entrance to the coffeehouse, but the PCs might also use a side door that opens onto an alley. Open windows on the second floor lead to the employee room (area <b>G5</b>) and Laria’s room (area <b>G7</b>), but a DC 20 Athletics check to Climb is required to reach the upper floor’s windows, which are 15 feet up. It’s unlikely, but a PC who succeeds at a DC 35 Society check knows a bit more about the coffeehouse—specifically, that there’s an underground level accessible via the city sewers that provides access to the building’s basement. Currently the chambers below the coffeehouse are vacant, so if the PCs know about this entrance they can approach the coffeehouse from below, entering via the trapdoor into the pantry (area <b>G3</b>).</p><p>If the PCs don’t immediately investigate and instead call for the city guard, the rakshasas are gone from the coffeehouse by the time anyone enters, and any surviving NPCs who would be found within have either been slain or shipped off to the slave pits in the quarry (area <b>J2</b>; page 49). Only the remnants of Barzillai remain.</p>","_id":"i7b5wP47M5Z8gvTQ"}

The building was once owned by the wealthy and selfish Najaria Arthrapple. In a display of exceptional diplomacy, Xerelilah convinced Najaria on her deathbed to leave the boathouse to the town, and the townspeople have operated and maintained the building collectively for almost 30 years. It’s become something of a maritime storehouse during that time, with lumber and pieces of old boats stacked up in the rafters or jammed into corners. This, combined with the structure’s location in the middle of the town’s waterfront, makes it a prime target for the firebugs among the Scarlet Triad slavers in town. If the PCs don’t seek out the boathouse on their own after hearing of Leppin’s fears (see Slaver Patrol on page 15), they might be sent here by a worried Xerelilah after they rescue her from the smokehouse (page 21).</p><p>As Leppin and Xerelilah had feared, two Scarlet Triad arsonists came to the boathouse a short time ago with the intent to set the immense building and its flammable contents ablaze. Unfortunately for the arsonists, the violence in the streets and the resulting bodies that have ended up in the waters of Cypress Point’s harbor have attracted a group of large predators from their nearby lair—three krooths. The amphibious creatures fed on the bodies thrown into the water and settled into the the boathouse interior, enjoying its cave-like shelter, and made quick work of the arsonists before they could finish turning the boathouse into a firebomb. While the krooths did Cypress Point a favor, their continued presence here makes the site unusable by the locals—even if the PCs don’t bother to visit the boathouse at this point, they might be contacted later in the adventure by Xerelilah to come back to town and deal with the monsters within this structure.</p>","_id":"i92cZUWtJNs8uJNY"}

Both of these missing people have ties to the Hidden Forge and Embermead’s plans.</p><p><b>Zamak:</b> Sentinel Stoneborn asks the PCs to investigate the disappearance of a man named Zamak, who vanished under suspicious circumstances after having an argument with his wife. Stoneborn informs the PCs what he knows of the situation—last week, Zamak and Olga, a married couple from the dwarven city of Larrad, arrived in Kovlar. The couple rented rooms in one of the city’s most expensive establishments, the Gold Sky Inn, but after a very public argument about finances, Zamak stormed out of the inn to seek separate lodging at a much less expensive site called Sleep Like a Stone. When Olga went looking for her husband at the other inn the next day, Zamak had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Olga’s still staying at the Gold Sky Inn, and if the PCs wish to speak to her she readily agrees, but has nothing to add to the mystery other than to tearfully beg for her husband’s safe return. A trip to Sleep Like a Stone confirms (with a short discussion with the innkeeper) that Zamak made it there safely. The innkeeper recalls that Zamak was angry upon arrival and drank quite a lot in the common room before loudly proclaiming he “needed a walk to clear his head.” He left the inn and never returned—the innkeeper assumed he’d returned to his wife but was distraught to learn Zamak vanished instead when she came looking for him later.</p><p>Further investigation requires the PCs to ask around in the streets and succeed at a DC 30 Diplomacy check to Gather Information. On a success, they run across several people who claimed to have noticed Zamak stumbling around drunk, heading north through the Earthfire District, although after this clue Zamak’s trail dries up—at least, until the PCs discover the Hidden Forge (page 29).</p><p><b>Algret:</b> The last time Algret, a member of the Guild of Finery, was seen in public was one day before Zamak vanished. Her disappearance bothers Adorned Dolgindir for a very specific reason—a strange letter she left behind. Dolgindir explains that the letter appeared on his desk the morning after Algret went missing. According to the letter, Algret claims that she had been feeling extremely nauseated from a pregnancy, which she had hid because she thought her friends might not approve of the clandestine relationship that lead to her maternity. In the letter, she claims that she has been engaged in a series of trysts with a charming man from Highhelm. The letter said that she would be checking in with the Physic Guild, and not to worry if she didn’t return to duty for a while. Adorned Dolginder confides in the PCs that Algret didn’t seem the type to hide a relationship for fear of what her friends might think—she has always been outspoken about her preferences and unflinching in her decisions. Dolginder also informs the PCs that no one in the Physic Guild has seen Algret—while he also wryly notes that the Physic Guild sometimes hides information about their patients to protect their privacy, he adds that he doesn’t believe the guild is covering anything up in this case.</p><p>If the PCs ask to see the letter, Dolginder shows it to them. In truth, the letter is a forgery, written to cover up what really happened to Algret. (See “Chiselrock’s Prison” on page 28 for details.) Dolginder can provide other examples of Algret’s handwriting if the PCs ask, at which point the PCs can attempt a DC 32 Perception or Society check to note that the letter is a forgery.</p><p>As with Zamak, a successful DC 30 Diplomacy check to Gather Information allows the PCs to determine that Algret was seen a few times as she headed into the Earthfire District. A critical success on this check allows the PCs to follow her trail all the way to Chiselrock’s Prison—otherwise, the PCs lose the trail but may still discover her in the prison should they investigate that site later on.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b> The PCs can rescue both of the missing dwarves later in this chapter—Zamak has been taken to the Hidden Forge (page 29), while Algret is now imprisoned in Chiselrock’s Prison (page 28). If the PCs rescue Zamak, Sentinel Stoneborn gives them a <i>pink rhomboid aeon stone</i>. If they rescue Algret, Adorned Dolgindir gives them a <i>berserker’s cloak</i>.</p><p><b>Hidden Forge Clues:</b> If the PCs manage to track Zamak’s trail to the Earthfire District, or Algret to Chiselrock’s Prison, they earn a Hidden Forge clue.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> The PCs earn 40 XP for tracking a missing dwarf to the Earthfire District—80 XP in all if they track both of the missing people.</p>","_id":"iLivm8kEzbXBpsyo"}

This awkward alignment causes those who step from it to stumble or even be flung by the transferred force of their departure, landing harmlessly to one side of the aperture. For all its erosion and apparent damage, the gate remains functional. Its easily buried profile has kept it hidden from those who might recognize its origin, and its weathered exterior has convinced scavengers that it’s not worth dismantling for raw material.</p><p>The toppled <i>aiudara</i> is positioned near a granite obelisk that stands atop a nearby rise on the outskirts of Finderplain. Propped against one side of the obelisk are the sand-blasted remains of a recently slain gnome wearing ragged heavy desert clothing. At the corpse’s side is a small satchel containing a waterskin, a week’s rations, and seven letters addressed to various parties in the city of Katapesh. Six of these are worried missives to gnome family members, and the seventh is an official plea for help from Soukmaster Satla Kivarn to the Pactmasters. Each letter speaks of the terrifying dust storms and haunting wails that had been plaguing the town of Finderplain. The messenger made it only a mile out of town before vainly seeking shelter against the obelisk, only to be discovered and slain by the dust storm’s creator: a dust wendigo. With a successful DC 25 Medicine check, a PC estimates that the gnome perished about 2 days ago from damage in keeping with a fall from a great height.</p><p>Of more immediate concern to the PCs is the raging dust storm that’s ravaging a roughly 3-mile-radius area surrounding Finderplain. The strong winds that blast grit across the fairly flat terrain cut visibility to about 50 feet (periodic lulls allow the PCs to spot distant structures before those are obscured once more), give all creatures within concealment, halve overland speed, and can blow away flying creatures (Acrobatics DC 30 to Maneuver in Flight). Every 10 minutes a PC spends out in the open, they must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save—failure indicates the PC is debilitated by the overwhelming sand and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to all checks for as long as they remain in the storm and an additional 10 minutes thereafter; a critical failure results in the character also becoming fatigued by the storm’s fury for the same duration.</p><p>With a successful DC 28 Nature check, a PC can ascertain that the dust storm’s intensity suggests a supernatural cause, and the degree to which the storm has shredded local plants indicates the storm’s been active for many hours.</p><p>Every minute, the PCs can attempt a DC 25 Perception check.

Each time the PCs use a portal in Alseta’s Ring, the manifestation strains against its weakening prison, and by this point it’s gained a limited degree of control over the space between the <i>aiudara</i>. This does not grant it much ability to permanently harm travelers, but it does allow the aspect to stretch this space and delay a traveler’s transposition. This gives Dahak’s manifestation a chance to taunt the PCs with promises of the destruction to come over the course of three short scenes: Devastation, Provocation, and Confrontation. During each scene, the PCs have a chance to combat apocalyptic events, and each scene has different conditions for what qualifies as successful resistance. The more scenes the PCs overcome successfully, the greater an edge they’ll have against Dahak’s manifestation at the beginning of “Broken Promises.”</p><p><b>Devastation:</b> As the PCs exit the Duskgate Way Station, they step into the middle of what appears to be Breachill’s incinerated ruins. A volcano has erupted beneath Citadel Altaerein, obliterating the fortress and showering the surrounding area with lava bombs. The PCs’ favorite buildings are ablaze, many with key NPCs trapped inside behind locked doors. Other structures have collapsed atop seriously injured townsfolk, innocents are stranded between narrow rivers of lava, and tremors have damaged the few viable shelters. All the while, bolts of red lightning course through the volcano’s cloud of ash, and the roiling mass takes the form of Dahak’s visage.</p><p>There’s no saving the town, but the PCs have opportunities to save their friends and neighbors. Each PC can attempt one DC 36 Acrobatics, Athletics, Breachill Lore, Crafting, Medicine, or Thievery check to help rescue vulnerable residents. At your discretion, the use of powerful spells that could divert a lava flow, create a solid shelter, or heal multiple targets could instead be treated as an automatically successful skill check result.</p><p>Count the number of successful checks, treat each critical success as two successes, and reduce the number of successes by one for each critical failure. If the PCs succeed at a number of these checks that exceeds half the number of PCs, they successfully overcome this scene—much to the looming dragon’s fury. Whether or not they succeed, proceed to Provocation.</p><p><b>Provocation:</b> The ash cloud’s draconic appearance coalesces into a semisolid form and dives groundward, exploding into a choking pyroclastic flow that blocks all sight. Through this storm of ash, the PCs can periodically sense Dahak circling around them as his dragonstorm wreaks havoc in the surrounding area. While circling the PCs, the manifestation goads the PCs, taunts them with assurances that their efforts are futile, invites them to accept fast deaths, and promises an imminent apocalypse.</p><p>The PCs need not accept the dragon’s doom-mongering and can refute its claims with wrath, deceit, and hope of their own. Likewise, knowledge of Dahak and dragons can help a PC dissect the manifestation’s claims and refute its prophecies. Each PC can attempt a DC 36 Arcana, Dahak Lore, Deception, Diplomacy, Dragon Lore, Intimidation, or Religion check. Count the successes and determine the PCs’ overall success in the same way as in Devastation above. Then proceed to the Confrontation scene.</p><p><b>Confrontation:</b> In response to the rebuttals, the dragonstorm collapses in on itself into a solid draconic form that towers over the PCs. This is the Promise of Fire, a fragment of Dahak’s power. It promises to make the PCs’ deaths swift and prepares to attack. While the Promise of Fire has the statistics of an ancient red dragon, the confrontation with it is not a true fight. The Promise of Fire uses an Intimidation check to determine its initiative, and the PCs have precisely one chance to confront and wound it before it attacks.</p><p>On its turn, the Promise of Fire breathes fire over the entire party, hurling the PCs away into a sandstorm of painful cinders. Not only do the PCs take the damage from the dragon’s breath weapon, but it casts them out from the Duskgate exit and into Katapesh—even if a PC avoided the damage with a critical success for the Reflex save. There, a dust storm is already raging, making it difficult to initially tell whether the PCs are still caught in the Duskgate vision or are somewhere else. The dragon’s attack effectively ends this encounter, beginning the Dust Storm encounter on page 10. A PC who would be slain by this breath weapon is instead reduced to 1 Hit Point and gains the doomed 1 condition.</p><p>For the PCs to successfully resist the manifestation, they must deal a total of 80 damage to it before it acts and casts them out of Duskgate. For each debilitating condition the PCs inflict on the manifestation, treat the creature as though it had taken 10 points of damage, though you might double the effective damage dealt by especially grievous conditions (like drained or unconscious) or conditions with high values (like frightened 4). If the PCs manage the unlikely task of slaying the Promise of Fire, it explodes, hurling the PCs back into the real world (without damaging them). The manifestation of Dahak trapped in the <i>aiudara</i> is not slain, but this defeat will grant the PCs a significant advantage in the next adventure.</p><blockquote><h4>The Promise Of Fire - CREATURE 19</h4><br>Ancient red dragon (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 112)<br><b>Initiative</b> Intimidation +37</blockquote><p><b>Resolution:</b> Although the PCs are in no position to defeat Dahak’s manifestation, their defiance can wound and rattle it. As the breath weapon hurls them away, the manifestation growls, “This is but the first of many devastations. Wherever you go, my fury shall follow.” Note how many of the three challenges the PCs successfully overcame and whether they managed to slay the Promise of Fire before it was able to attack, and record that information for use during the first chapter of “Broken Promises.\"</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs manage to overcome one of the three challenges, grant them 60 XP.

However, much of what was once in the palace has been incinerated or destroyed, for it was here that Veshumirix recently confronted King Harral. In addition to turning the king’s body and the bodies of many of the king’s other servants to ash, Veshumirix also melted or burned away many of the palace’s treasures. Only the magical wards on the throne room held up against the dragon’s onslaught, allowing King Harral to still hold court in his new body as a result.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> Whether the PCs follow the wraith to this location or discover it independently, the king sits upon his throne, patiently awaiting their arrival. The king himself was a powerful wizard in life, and while he lived, the idea of extending his life after death via lichdom would have turned his stomach. It is therefore a cruel irony that he exists now as a lich-like guardian—he doesn’t possess the phylactery of a standard lich, and he is compelled to exist only to protect Saggorak, and will continue to do so until the city is gone. While the Old King hides it well, Veshumirix’s devastating attack on the ruined city shook his confidence; he felt the destruction of each and every building and knows that with each structure reduced to slag, his own power and thus his ability to protect Saggorak’s legacy dwindles. He fears that another direct confrontation with the dragon would only result in another defeat and the loss of more of the city’s remaining buildings. The arrival of the PCs gives the undead king hope.</p><p>King Harral appears as a skeletal dwarven man, with sunken green eyes and a long silvery beard that clings to the bleached leathery flesh of his jaw. He wears the tattered and singed remains of royal regalia, but no crown graces his skull. Standing at King Harral’s side are four menacing graveknights, the last surviving members of what was once a large order in his service, the former Armored faction. These knights were out tending to other duties when Veshumirix attacked, so they were spared the fate that most of their compatriots suffered when Veshumirix tossed their suits of armor into the lava in his lair, destroying them permanently. The graveknights are somewhat wary of the PCs, but they are willing to give them a chance to prove their usefulness to their king.</p><p>King Harral is arrogant, but he has heard of the PCs’ prowess, and he is wise enough to know that people as skilled as the PCs tend to demand respect. The centuries of rule within haunted Saggorak and his festering frustration and hatred regarding his city’s fate have left Harral embittered, cruel, and unforgiving, yet when he speaks to the PCs, he does so with the tone and demeanor appropriate for greeting important dignitaries or ambassadors, at least at first. However, if the PCs actively show him disrespect, his appraisal of the PCs degrades, and he speaks to them more as common mercenaries.</p><p>King Harral intends to offer the PCs what he believes is important advice in exchange for their assistance in defeating Veshumirix, and doesn’t waste their time with overlong preambles once they arrive in the throne hall. He explains that when Veshumirix attacked Saggorak several years ago, the dragon descended upon the city in fury, raining down magma on anyone who dared to challenge him—and many who did not. The dragon’s burning desire for power won out over the short-term thrill of destruction, and so whenever he found a battle too challenging, he retreated under the magma to rest and fight another day. Before long, King Harral himself came after the dragon. In a pitched battle, Veshumirix defeated the undead king, as well as most of the king’s graveknight retainers. What King Harral had hoped would result, at worst, in a glorious martyr’s death became the greatest insult of his undeath, for he rejuvenated a day later on his throne, without his crown (see page 57 for the crown’s current location).</p><p>Since that time, Veshumirix has been solidifying his position as ruler of Saggorak, with plans to eventually conquer Kovlar. King Harral notes that Veshumirix will not stop at ruling Saggorak—the dragon will destroy and enslave all of Kovlar as well. Worse, King Harral has learned that the dragon has allied with surface dwellers—he doesn’t know much about the Scarlet Triad and is eager to learn what the PCs know about them, but other than confirming they work with the dragon, he has little further information about them to add.</p><p>If the PCs agree to help, King Harral tells the PCs that they can find Veshumirix and his Scarlet Triad allies in and below the Temple of All Gods, but he warns the PCs that simply charging forward to that location would be foolish. The streets and skies alike are patrolled by members of the Starved Faction and their commanded Pawns, undead who have pledged servitude to Veshumirix. As a result, King Harral recommends one of two routes that the PCs can take to reach the Temple of All Gods without having to face overwhelming opposition. These two options are detailed below, as are two other less viable tactics the PCs might consider.</p><p><b>Subterfuge:</b> While the Bound have not declared their allegiance to any one leader, many of Saggorak’s ghostly inhabitants maintain a presence in and around the Temple of All Gods. King Harral bears the Bound no ill will, but admits that the PCs may come into conflict with them. His suggestion is for the PCs to secure something that will help the Bound to recognize them not as intruders but as allies—and by wearing something of his old regalia that has been infused with Saggorak’s traditions, they can do exactly this. The problem here is that the only surviving regalia that could potentially afford such protection lies in the Haunted Halls (page 43), themselves the domain of several of the Bound. If the PCs can recover and wear the regalia left in the Haunted Halls, they’ll be able to avoid the attention of the haunts and other Bound who dwell in the Temple of All Gods.</p><p><b>Disrupt Leadership:</b> By confronting the leader of the Starved and destroying him in his sanctum, the PCs can force the Starved to abandon their allegiance to the dragon, and the PCs won’t encounter additional undead in the Temple of All Gods.</p><p><b>Ignoring the King’s Advice:</b> The PCs are, of course, free to make their way directly to the Temple of All Gods without first weakening the Starved, but if they do, they’ll face many more undead foes there.</p><p><b>Violence:</b> It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that intolerant or zealous PCs might attack Harral, either out of inherent violence or convictions that all undead must be put to rest. In this case, Harral howls in fury at the treachery as he and his graveknights do their best to defeat the PCs—in this case, Harral hopes to recruit the PCs as undead slaves. If the PCs destroy King Harral and his graveknights but no further steps are taken, the undead simply rejuvenate. Destroying the graveknights’ armor prevents their return, but to prevent the Old King from being restored in a new body on his throne, every remaining building in Saggorak must be destroyed. This task is likely beyond the PCs’ capacity, of course—an easier way of ending King Harral’s undeath would be to work with him and save Saggorak from the dragon (see “Concluding the Adventure” for more details). For his part, King Harral does not hold a grudge, and if he’s destroyed and reforms, he wearily sends another wraith to seek out the PCs and invite them for another meeting, during which he notes, “You may raise arms against me many times, but I am cursed to always return despite your victories. And I need but one triumph to end you. Do you not see the foolishness? Take my advice and turn this wrath to the Starved so that you might stand a chance against the dragon!”</p><h4>King Harral - Creature 14</h4><blockquote><h4>Graveknights (4) - CREATURE 10</h4><br><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 191<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +19</blockquote>","_id":"jZg2UsnBdli2NvfF"}

To activate Dreamgate, the PCs need only touch <i>Eclipse</i> to the portal, which causes the stone within the arch to turn into a shimmering curtain of mist. The portal remains active for 10 minutes before closing—the other side of the portal allows travelers from within to emerge, but not to reenter without activating the portal again.</p><p>Dreamgate was dedicated to the goddess Desna and connects to Avistan’s western coast. As with all other portals in Alseta’s Ring, a small complex called a way station exists within Dreamgate. Unlike Huntergate, Dreamgate’s way station remains intact, yet it is far from safe. This way station, in keeping with its Desnan themes, was intended to be a safe place for travelers to rest and enjoy pleasant dreams. To encourage this, two dreaming chambers were created within. Note that as with all way stations in Alseta’s Ring, this area is its own small demiplane, and travel to and from it is difficult without using the portals that connect it to Golarion.</p><p>Decades ago, a night hag named Abelstia discovered the way station from the Ethereal Plane, drawn to it after noticing echoes of strange, dream-related magic in the Ethereal Plane. More importantly, she discovered that the way station’s dreaming chambers allowed her to travel between the demiplane and the Ethereal Plane by means of her dream haunting ability. She soon realized the rooms would make an excellent refuge for herself and the other hags in her coven, Kelleni and Senna. It wasn’t long before the three were able to corrupt the way station to better serve their propensity for nightmares.</p><p>Abelstia recognized the two <i>aiudara</i> at either end of her new lair as inactive portals, and after she found no way to open them without their key, she and her coven tried to block these portals and prevent others from invading their new home from outside. Unfortunately for Abelstia, the magical backlash from her attempt to meddle with the portals killed her.</p><p>To maintain their coven, the other two hags recruited a replacement: Rusty Mae. The re-formed coven preserved Abelstia’s memory—and her corpse—in the way station. Over time, Rusty Mae has risen to a position of leadership in the coven, and the hags now consider Dreamgate way station their personal realm.</p><p>The chambers within Dreamgate way station are 15 feet high. The walls, floors, and ceilings of the rooms are stone and decorated with carvings of stars and butterflies. The tiny star carvings glow softly, providing dim light in each room. Sound is muffled between chambers in the way station. This was intended to keep noises from disturbing those sleeping in areas <b>B2</b>or <b>B3</b>, but it also means that the sounds of combat in one room won’t carry over to others. Particularly flashy spell effects could alert neighboring encounters to trouble. Within a room, sound isn’t muffled.</p>","_id":"k1w2VFI0RkQmDYNm"}

Metal shelves underneath the walkways support bags of coal, metal ingots of multiple materials, blacksmithing tools, crucibles, sheaves of blueprints, and molds for a variety of weapons and ornaments.</blockquote><p><b>Creatures:</b> Two Triad operatives are in charge of sorting through the equipment here, assessing what to keep, and destroying the rest. They’re especially cautious about the forge, which has sputtered and raged unpredictably. They’re right to be concerned, for this magical forge is powered by a phoenix named Vtrik who has been imprisoned within for many centuries. Ever since Vtrik lashed out at the lich Teyam Ishtori and inadvertently destroyed her phylactery, the beast has endured punishment as the source of this forge’s fire. Over the centuries, Vtrik has been slowly breaking free from his prison. While trapped here and forced to toil for the Scarlet Triad, the gnome Exavisu Kerndalion worked to subtly sabotage the forge, hoping to release the frantic creature within. Now, the forge is just a push away from catastrophic failure.</p><p>The encounter begins with only the Scarlet Triad operatives and a pair of nalfeshnee demons who have been bound to the site as guardians. However, on its turn during the second round, Vtrik spends one action to finally break free, cracking the forge in half. The enraged phoenix appears in the room near the PCs, then attacks anyone in sight. Centuries of rage make the phoenix indiscriminate in his attacks, though a PC who can Make an Impression quickly (such as with Legendary Negotiator) can calm him (DC 41 Diplomacy) to cease his attack. Otherwise, Vtrik fights until slain, then is considerably calmer upon resurrecting.</p><blockquote><h4>Scarlet Triad Boss - CREATURE 17</h4><br>Page 57<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +30</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Triad Enforcer - CREATURE 15</h4><br>Page 41<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +25</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Nalfeshnees (2) - CREATURE 14</h4><br>Page 86<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +25</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Vtrik - CREATURE 16</h4><br>Male elite phoenix<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 6, 261<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +29</blockquote><p><b>Freeing the Phoenix:</b>Although he may be free from the forge (either after being calmed or after he resurrects), Vtrik is immense and unable to escape without help. Teleportation is an expedient option, though it is also possible to seal the phoenix within another receptacle, such as any lamp, brazier, or gem worth at least 1,000 gp. Vtrik sees this as a desperate measure, but so long as the PCs make him friendly (he begins as indifferent), he accepts the plan. While Vtrik is sealed in this way, the receptacle functions as a <i>demilich eye gem</i> (<i>Bestiary</i>223) that contains the spell <i>fiery body</i> (9th). So long as he’s freed within a week or so, Vtrik is content and uses his magic to create a <i>greater flaming rune</i> for the PCs as recompense. If the PCs wait much longer, he breaks free the next time the receptacle is activated and attacks the PCs.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b> Among the tools and papers are some of the blueprints the Scarlet Triad has yet to destroy for the repaired <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i>, showing the experiments and techniques used to restore the artifact to partial working order.

A complicated iron mechanism built against the wall has several plates that sit flush against the smooth wall. Water stains on the wall below these plates indicate that the plates keep back water behind the wall.</blockquote><p>This room is the only remaining access to the series of underground dams built by the Jhalteros’ engineers many years ago. Water from underground streams has built up behind this wall. The metal plates are closed sluices that keep the water safely contained, although pulling a lever among the machinery (or a backup lever in a different spot in the machinery) opens all the sluices at once and allows the dammed water to flood in. Once the sluices are opened, they must be moved back manually and individually—the lever only opens them. The released water doesn’t fill this room, however; any water here flows out through the three chutes to the south and into the quarry pit (area <b>J2</b></p><p>). Because the slaves imprisoned there are in pits at the bottom of the quarry, they eventually drown if enough water flows into the quarry. Full rules for the sluice appear in Hazard below.</p><p>Laslunn knows how the mechanism works, and she considers it insurance against discovery. If her operations here are compromised, she plans to drown all of the captured slaves, escape, and start anew. She also assumes that any well-intentioned intruders would have to split their time between capturing her and freeing the drowning slaves, which she expects gives her a greater chance to defeat them. </p><p>Laslunn also keeps a small table here covered with maps and correspondence, including notes about Alseta’s Ring in Breachill. These notes reveal that Laslunn suspects other contacts in the Scarlet Triad are trying to magically convert Alseta’s Ring into a weapon somehow, but Laslunn isn’t clear how and has been attempting to gain more information about this from her contacts elsewhere in the organization. The table also contains a glittering magic gemstone—the <i>Eye of the Wise</i>—which Laslunn acquired from her contacts. She knows it can be used to activate Jewelgate, and her notes indicate, in particular, that she hopes to use the Eye of the Wise to leverage her influence with her direct superior, Ilssrah Embermead, who is currently working to secure the far side of that <i>aiudara</i> under the Five Kings Mountains. Finally, the notes indicate that Laslunn is growing impatient with the Scarlet Triad’s plans to leave Alseta’s Ring untouched. She would rather launch an immediate attack on Breachill to secure the hub and doesn’t agree with her commanders’ fears that “doing so would alert our benefactor,” but for the moment she has been content to bide her time.</p><p>The desk is far enough from the water that it remains dry even if the sluices are opened, but it becomes soaked if the PCs block the chutes so the water backs up into this room. In this case, the papers detailing Laslunn’s notes are ruined but the <i>Eye of the Wise</i> is unharmed. </p><p>The chutes to the south lead out to the quarry pit (area <b>J2</b>). Created to channel water away, they are steep and smooth—sliding down them is easy, but climbing back up them requires a successful DC 25 Athletics check to Climb. It’s impossible to climb up a chute when water is flowing down it.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> Laslunn is usually found in this room at her desk, but if she suspects intruders in the quarry, she moves over to the primary sluice lever instead, draws her bow, and prepares to defend herself. Laslunn is not alone in this room—she is protected by a powerful interlocutor velstrac conjured at great expense by Barushak and commanded to protect Laslunn and prevent others from interfering with the hazard once it has been activated.</p><p>Laslunn’s first action when combat begins here is to pull the activation lever on the sluice. While she fights, she provides a running commentary, gloating about how all the slaves are going to drown if the PCs don’t intervene—Laslunn hopes this diverts some of the PCs from the fight and gives her time to focus on those attacking her. If reduced to fewer than 30 Hit Points and presented with a clear avenue of escape, Laslunn takes the chance to flee; otherwise, she fights to the death out of spite and endeavors to take as many PCs with her as possible.</p><blockquote><h4>Laslunn - CREATURE 13</h4><br>Page 86<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +24</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Interlocutor - CREATURE 12</h4><br>Page 84<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +24</blockquote><p><b>Hazard:</b> The machinery controlling the sluices in this room functions as detailed below.</p><h4>Quarry Sluiceway - Hazard 9</h4><p><b>Treasure:</b> In addition to the notes and the <i>Eye of the Wise</i>, Laslunn’s desk contains a leather satchel with 5 rubies worth 300 sp each, an excellent wooden carving of a leering hyena worth 350 sp, and a <i>messenger’s ring</i> bearing the symbol of the Scarlet Triad.</p>","_id":"nAYejAGx2vOgcjX1"}

The granary is one of the only food stores likely to remain intact. The Bluemarket is where most travelers do business, and it’s likely that survivors unfamiliar with Finderplain are hunkered down there in need of aid. Finally, Royal Rise is one of the larger residences and is home to one of Satla’s predecessors, the former High King Narvimelbs. Although she considers the ex-monarch a boor, Satla knows he’s resourceful, inspires his neighbors, and would be invaluable in defending the Basin.</p><p>The dust storm makes it difficult to navigate. Traveling from one site to another takes 10 minutes, exposing the PCs to the dust storm (page 10).</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> For each of the sites at which the PCs fulfill Satla’s objectives, award the PCs 40 XP. If the PCs also remove the gnome Eloisil’s curse, grant them an additional 40 XP.<h3>North Granary</h3>Built atop a grid of 15 stone columns in the Spire Walk neighborhood, the north granary is a rectangular storehouse that stands 4 feet off the ground.</p><p>To keep the Basin’s residents fed (and qualify for an XP award), the PCs need to bring back at least 30 Bulk worth of food. By carefully assessing the supplies, selecting only the best options, and packing the loads wisely, the PCs can increase the quantity of food they recover. One PC can attempt to do so with a DC 36 Survival check or an appropriate DC 32 Lore check (such as Cooking Lore, Farming Lore, or Milling Lore) to Search, increasing the party’s total recovered supplies by 3 Bulk on a success (or by 6 on a critical success).</p><blockquote><h4>Haul Supplies</h4><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">EXPLORATION</span><span style=\"border: 1px #000000 solid; padding: 0.2em\">MOVE</span><br>You pack up as many supplies as you can carry and make your way back to Bazal’s Basin with food and water.

Here they’ve survived on the inn’s larders, but on three different occasions the wendigo has circled the building, howled, and rattled the building’s walls. The civilians are all eager to relocate but won’t do so without a major escort. While the PCs’ presence is reassuring, most of the survivors here think the PCs are too few to protect the whole group in the open, so the inn’s occupants are hesitant to leave their one place of safety. <b>Soluk Tark</b> (CN female dwarf) is especially outspoken against leaving the inn, and many here look to her as a leader in this disaster. A successful DC 34 Diplomacy check to Request that they join the other survivors for safety, Deception check to Lie about the dangers outside, or Intimidation check to Coerce (which likely involves taking down Tark with a nonlethal strike) can all convince the survivors to brave the harsh conditions and depart for the Basin. In any event, escorting the civilians back to Bazal’s Basin is automatically successful once they’re convinced to accompany the PCs to safety.</p><p><b>Locating Stragglers:</b> Of the other folk who tried to find shelter in Bluemarket, many have already died of exposure or been picked off by monsters. Finding the remaining survivors is difficult work that exposes the PCs to the dust storm for 10 minutes. To search for survivors, the PCs must Scout and attempt a DC 35 Medicine, Perception, or Survival check. For each successful check, the PCs evacuate several survivors to a temporary shelter, but also turn up numerous corpses of humanoids and pack animals that fell victim to the weather, elementals, wendigo, or some combination of these. Three successes are required to finish this task—with a fourth success, the PCs confirm that there are unlikely to be more survivors sheltering in Bluemarket.</p><p><b>Assisting Eloisil:</b> The civilian survivors in Bluemarket all know that a fearsome beast stalks Finderplain, but only a handful have seen it and can describe its appearance as a “towering horned man with glowing eyes.” Only the gnome Eloisil has witnessed the wendigo up close, and he is currently afflicted with stage 1 of the wendigo torment curse (<i>Bestiary</i> 327), leaving his speech somewhat slurred and his thoughts muddled. He struggles to recount the experience, in which he was snatched by the antelope-headed beast, after which he felt his body growing lighter and lighter as the creature spoke hungry thoughts into his mind. In a panic, Eloisil bit at the creature’s claw, and the beast dropped him atop a roof (less out of pain than in delight at the gnome’s eagerness to tear flesh with his teeth). Eloisil made his way back to the inn, where the others have done what they can to comfort him. It’s been more than a day since he returned, and the other survivors fear the trauma has left him badly disturbed. Due to the curse’s high save DC, Eloisil will almost certainly critically fail his next Will save, shortly after he reaches the Basin (advancing to Stage 3); at this point he sneaks away, kills another gnome, consumes part of the victim, and then loudly flees to transform into a new dust wendigo.</p><p>Until then, with a successful DC 41 Arcana or Nature check to Recall Knowledge, a PC can use Eloisil’s hazy description to identify the monster as a dust wendigo, a rare desert version of what is typically an arctic beast. Wendigos are particularly known for tormenting and cursing victims, releasing some infected prey to consume their friends and transform into new wendigos. What’s more, that PC recognizes that Eloisil’s symptoms match the early stages of this transformative curse. Even without identifying the wendigo, a PC who studies the gnome with <i>detect magic</i> can determine that he’s under the effect of an enchantment. The DC to Identify this Magic using Nature is 41. The only ways to stop Eloisil’s transformation are to keep him firmly restrained, remove the curse, or kill him. So long as the PCs prevent Eloisil from terrorizing the Basin and transforming, they succeed at this goal.</p><p><b>Recovering Gear:</b> The PCs can search Bluemarket for useful tools and supplies. Finding these treasures requires succeeding at DC 34 Crafting, Perception, or Thievery checks as part of a search, with each attempt requiring 10 minutes spent in the dust storm. Once the PCs achieve three successes, they can transport the gear back to safety. Among this gear are some potentially useful or valuable items that Satla insists the PCs keep as a reward—37 sling bullets, a standard-grade cold iron scimitar, an assortment of several hundred animal figurines carved out of semiprecious stone (collectively worth 400 gp), and a trunk containing six different high-fashion outfits of Nexian style (collectively worth 330 gp).<h3>Royal Rise</h3>Royal Rise is a cobbled-together compound atop a low hill. When the dust storm began, its owner, <b>Narvimelbs</b>(N male gnome; Will +26), ushered in those he considered his loyal subjects and then sealed the doors. He, his two retainers, and several dozen other survivors have feasted here ever since, making merry in an attempt to drown out the howling wendigo and scouring winds. The whole affair soothes Narvimelbs’s ego; although he insists that he abdicated his role as high king several months ago, he in fact was overthrown by citizens who were weary of his posturing. As monarch emeritus, he insists on being referred to as nothing less grandiose than “your majesty.”Once the PCs signal the guards from outside and confirm that they’re not monsters, they are invited into Narvimelbs’s feast hall. After 2 days of increasingly forced revelry with periodic breaks to sleep, the party seems a little deflated. The arrival of new guests, though, encourages Narvimelbs to ascend his gilded throne and “hold court.” He listens magnanimously to any request to join forces with Satla but waves them off as unreasonable. After all, he observes, there’s still so much roistering yet to do!</p><p>Convincing the faux king to abandon his palace and assist Finderplain directly requires three successful DC 36 skill checks (or a single critical success) before failing twice (or critically failing once). Suitable skills include Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Performance, and Society. In place of a skill check, a PC can try to impress Narvimelbs by out-drinking him, which requires a DC 36 Fortitude save. A success or critical success contributes to the PCs’ overall success as above, whereas a failure doesn’t offend him—it simply makes the PC clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for the next 2 hours. On a critical failure, both condition values are 2 and the PC is also sickened 2.</p><p>If the PCs succeed at enough checks, Narvimelbs agrees (possibly in a state of some inebriation) to come with the PCs, bringing his entourage and supplies with him. If the PCs instead fail too many times, the haughty gnome banishes them. He lacks the force to significantly threaten the PCs (though his guards do leap to his defense as needed). Instead, failure represents his stubborn unwillingness to work with Satla, in which case dragging him to the Basin would merely aggravate the situation for everyone.</p>","_id":"pauoE5D76WZxKdr9"}

The Pactmasters are all too familiar with the Scarlet Triad’s tactics, but sending in the Zephyr Guards would only prompt the Scarlet Triad to execute their hostage. Instead, the Pactmasters elect to ask an independent team to do the job for them: the PCs.After the Council of Guilds’ abrupt end, Hashim ibn Sayyid signals for the PCs to follow him, quietly indicating that the Pactmasters wish to speak with them. He leads the PCs into a back room where two of the Pactmasters (Angruul and Morvithus) await them. The two wait for the PCs to file in before explaining the delicate situation the Scarlet Triad has created and the Pactmasters’ intention to have the PCs raid the Red Pyramid, do whatever damage they wish to the Scarlet Triad, and recover their colleague Tsandarkon. The Pactmasters admit that they learned of Tsandarkon’s disappearance not long before the Council meeting, and that they had suspicions about the Scarlet Triad’s involvement but no proof. Now that they know their colleague has been abducted, they ask the PCs to step in and solve the problem. The Pactmasters themselves wish to stand back from these events, so that if the PCs try and fail, the Pactmasters will be able to disavow collaborating with the PCs, and can condemn them publicly—but they also matter-of-factly state that they expect the PCs to succeed. If they do, the Pactmasters promise that no charges of public endangerment or aggression against a guild will be filed against the PCs, and further, they promise to see that the PCs are well rewarded for their service to the city.However, the two Pactmasters caution that the Scarlet Triad is moving quickly. It’s only a matter of a few days before the entire organization escapes, and each attack on them is likely to encourage more resistance. If the PCs propose just ambushing the Scarlet Triad as they move from the pyramid to the docks, the Pactmasters veto the plan, arguing the PCs will provoke the Scarlet Triad into believing the city is defying the cease-fire’s terms and therefore execute their hostage. What’s more, many Triad members can teleport short distances, allowing them to move their most crucial treasures directly to unidentified ships in the harbor or outside the city. If the PCs move ahead with such a plan, you’ll need to rework the rest of this chapter’s contents as needed; “Against the Scarlet Triad” assumes the adventure ends with a tense invasion of the Scarlet Triad’s headquarters under the Red Pyramid.</p>","_id":"pceFvdfgTvBamz7E"}

Use the Katapesh Streets map on page 40 for this encounter. Many of the buildings feature open storefronts and wholesale vendors selling pesh of varying quality. However, Ghost has no intention of showing up for a meeting with the PCs. Instead, this is a opportunity for the Unseen Hand to sabotage some of Katapesh’s iconic aluums and cast doubt on the Zephyr Guards’ ability to keep the peace.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> As the PCs are waiting, two Zephyr Guards accompanied by a pair of spiritbound aluums enter the plaza. The onlookers give the procession a wide berth, but the guards show a charcoal illustration to various bystanders as though searching for a criminal. With a successful DC 35 Perception check, a PC can see the image of a middle-aged human woman, and they can spot that woman fetching water from the fountain. Moments later, the guards spot her as she tries to sneak away, presenting their aluum charms and commanding the aluums to detain her. At first, the constructs don’t respond. However, any PCs who succeeded at the Perception check see two figures—one in the southeast alley and another in a third-story window—present their own aluum charms and issue quiet commands. The aluums respond to these orders, each grabbing a Zephyr Guard and crushing them messily.With that, the aluums begin rampaging around the plaza. They ignore mere bystanders, inflicting property damage on the pesh shops and attacking anyone who fights back. If the PCs don’t intervene, the aluums do considerable damage before a larger group of Zephyr Guards finally arrives to deactivate them.</p><blockquote><h4>Spiritbound Aluums (2) - CREATURE 16</h4><br>Page 83<b>Initiative</b> Perception +28</blockquote><p><b>Aftermath:</b> If the PCs defeat the aluums, witnesses approach to assess the damage caused by the golems and to investigate the noise. Many complain that this isn’t the first time the Pactmasters’ pet golems have escaped control, and they question how the Zephyr Guard could have failed like this. Some of the surviving pesh merchants quietly accuse each other of inviting this disaster, citing the League of Peshmongers’ unpopular attempts to control the drug supply. Everyone observes the PCs, waiting to see if they can clarify the matter.</p><p>This is an opportunity for the PCs to speak out in favor of the Pactmasters, denounce the Pactmasters, or remain neutral. A pro-Pactmaster stance might involve revealing that this event was the work of the Unseen Hand or that it was an accident. This pleases the Pactmasters, who encourage several other guilds to view the PCs favorably. The PCs reduce Support Points for one or more guilds by a total of 4, divided as they choose among the guilds. An anti-Pactmaster stance might involve declaring that the incident was retaliation from the Pactmasters for the League’s defiance. Although this displeases the Pactmasters, it shows the League that the alliance with the Scarlet Triad is insufficient protection; this shifts the League’s stance to anti–Scarlet Triad and ensures it’ll vote against the group.</p><p>The following day, the PCs receive a final letter from Whahar that notes Ghost is most intrigued by how the meeting went and will continue watching their actions with interest. </p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs take a stance regarding the Pactmasters (regardless of which stance they take), grant them 40 XP.</p>","_id":"sTXgbs9vzsKDiBqz"}

Rugs in vibrant geometrical patterns cover the floor. A mandolin standing atop a stone pillar emits a lively tune on its own.</blockquote><p><b>Creature:</b> Sedranni Vashnarstill, a tall human woman draped in elaborate shawls and elegant jewelry, rushes over to speak with anyone entering the shop. Her first words are an attempt to rudely dismiss the PCs: “Pardon me, are you lost? I am Lady Sedranni Vashnarstill, the owner of this establishment, and I assure you there is little to here to interest anyone of your…” she looks the PCs up and down. “…pedigree. Good day.” She continues in this insulting fashion, insisting that the PCs depart while identifying shortcomings in their dress or appearance. </p><p>This attitude doesn’t befit the normally gracious Sedranni, and a PC who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check to Sense Motive when interacting with her for at least 1 minute realizes that she is nervous, perhaps hiding something, and just wants the PCs to leave as quickly as possible. On a critical success at this check, the PCs realizes that Sedranni is terrified underneath her discourteous bluster. </p><p>Getting Sedranni to open up requires a successful DC 27 Diplomacy check to Make an Impression or a successful DC 27 Deception check to Lie about the PCs’ motives (either to convince her that they are legitimate customers with questions or, with a critical success, to convince her they are representatives of the Scarlet Triad). A PC who reacts to Sedranni’s boorishness with a consistently polite and pleasant demeanor shames her into revealing her recent troubles and gains a +2 circumstance bonus to any Diplomacy or Deception check to secure her cooperation. A PC who instead relies upon threats has a slightly easier time swaying Sedranni, as she’s already near her breaking point. A PC who succeeds at a DC 22 Intimidation check to Coerce Sedranni convinces her to cooperate.</p><p>If the PCs recovered Sedranni’s <i>cape of the mountebank</i> from the <i>Genie’s Smile</i> and she realizes they have it, she also realizes the PCs are likely no friends of the Scarlet Triad, and the PCs gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks they attempt to secure her cooperation—if they reveal to her that they’re enemies of the Scarlet Triad and offer to return her cape, they automatically gain her trust and she allows them to keep it.</p><p>If the PCs successfully gain Sedranni’s trust or exploit her fear, she says the following.</p><blockquote>“We were desperate to stay in business. We had unpaid bills, outstanding shipments, more goods than would fit in the warehouse, and no one to buy them. The Scarlet Triad seemed like the only way forward. I just really had no idea what they were really like. I’m not part of any of their frightful activities. I just want them gone, but instead, they’ve taken over. I can’t even get into the warehouse, and there is something horrific going on back there. I would give anything—I would give up this business, which has been my whole life—to reverse this whole sordid mess.”</blockquote><p>Sedranni can provide more specifics about Scarlet Triad operations to the PCs, as follows.</p><p><b>Slavery:</b> Sedranni is certain that the Triad is engaged in slavery, even though the flesh trade has been illegal in Ravounel since its founding a few years ago.</p><p><b>Laslunn:</b> Sedranni has only seen the local leader of the Scarlet Triad only once, but that was one time too many in her view. Laslunn is a ferocious-looking gnoll with a scar across her snout and a cloudy eye. The other members of the Scarlet Triad are utterly loyal to her. Laslunn gave several of them directions to spread out throughout the city, but Sedranni doesn’t know where or for what purposes—although she assumes the worst. Sedranni hasn’t seen Laslunn in many days and, from conversations she’s overheard between other Scarlet Triad members, believes Laslunn is no longer in Kintargo at all.</p><p><b>The Scarlet Triad:</b> The slavers have taken over her warehouse. Sedranni has been specifically instructed to remain in the showroom and make it look as if Sunset Imports is open, but to turn away all potential clients. Scarlet Triad agents sometimes come and go through the showroom and cast threatening glances at her. One agent once asked her where to buy poison in town, and she overheard another laugh about his work with “the demons.” There used to be a dozen or more Scarlet Triad members in her warehouse, but she thinks there are much fewer now. (In fact, nearly all of them recently left to pursue leads regarding the Bellflower Network; only a Scarlet Triad bruiser named Lurb and a slaver demon remain.) </p><p><b>The Genie’s Smile:</b> The Scarlet Triad had a ship called the <i>Genie’s Smile</i> docked here at Sunset Imports until a few days ago, and it was crewed with the most ruthless and bloodthirsty crew she’s ever seen. They helped themselves to whatever they wanted from the warehouse and left particularly well provisioned.</p><p><b>The Warehouse:</b> Sedranni is convinced that all sorts of dark deeds are performed in her warehouse; she’s heard screaming and sobbing, even as recently as a few minutes ago. She points out a double door that leads into the warehouse and the smaller door that leads to a hallway that might let the PCs reach the back of the warehouse unseen. Although Sedranni doesn’t want to risk having the PCs sleep in Sunset Imports for fear of discovery, she points out that her office (area <b>F3</b>) might make a good place for the PCs to retreat for a short time if necessary. She doesn’t believe the Scarlet Triad has been interested in it, and she’s correct.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b> The mandolin playing on its own is a <i>moderatemaestro’s instrument</i>. Its ability to play on its own is due to a magical link with the heavy stone pillar; it doesn’t play on its own when removed from the pillar, and the pillar doesn’t cause any other instrument other than the mandolin to play. Sedranni likes the mandolin but is willing to part with it for 450 gp if selling it to the PCs gets them out of her shop quickly. If the PCs handle her Scarlet Triad problem, Sedranni gives it to them for free instead. The pillar is made from Arcadian granite and weighs 800 pounds, but Sedranni includes it with the mandolin for no additional charge.</p><p>As mentioned previously, if the PCs recovered Sedranni’s <i>cape of the mountebank</i> from the <i>Genie’s Smile</i>, she gratefully allows them to keep it.</p>","_id":"sUxKZLDqhewEdN0m"}

These chambers were an ancient shrine to Minderhal, a cruel smith-god of the giants, and their discovery was enough to finally close the quarry.</p><p>The Scarlet Triad identified the deep quarry as a potential storage pen for prisoners gathered from around Ravounel, and when she visited the site, Laslunn approved. Best of all was the system of sluices; if she needed to cover her activities quickly, Laslunn could flood the quarry and drown the slaves imprisoned at the quarry’s bottom.</p><p>Yet the Scarlet Triad were not the only ones to arrive at the quarry. The activity near the shrine to Minderhal drew the attention of a stone giant lich named Jaggaki. Jaggaki knew that such shrines sometimes contain sacred markings, so he collected a few retainers—both living and undead—and investigated. At first, the giants clashed with the slavers who had recently come to the site, but Laslunn realized that an alliance with these visitors could be very useful. Laslunn and Jaggaki reached an agreement: the giants would be free to study the shrine, and the slavers would provide for their basic needs such as food and water. In exchange, the giants would come to the aid of the slavers to repel an attack or quell any slave uprisings. The current denizens of the quarry may be disparate, but they work together when under attack.</p><p>The chambers within the stone around the quarry average 12 feet high, but the areas occupied by the stone giants (areas <b>J5</b> through <b>J7</b>) are 15 feet high instead.

His natural beauty and grace have earned him a powerful and supernatural patron—a simurgh named Prihayn Ti Huet—who sees the camel as an expression of Shelyn’s artistic will. Shortly after the PCs capture Duneshadow, the simurgh alights atop a 20-foot-diameter boulder about 50 feet away. He menacingly fans his wings and inquires what the PCs are doing, accusing the PCs of stealing living art from the canvas that is Katapesh and challenging them to justify their actions.</p><p>The simplest way to meet this challenge is to fight the simurgh, but PCs who recognize the creature for what it is may balk at attacking a good creature. Additionally, if any PC is obviously a worshipper of Shelyn, Prihayn appeals to that character’s sensibilities—in such a case, Diplomacy might be a better choice (see below). Further possibilities are explored below—at your discretion, other methods of appealing to the simurgh could also result in a peaceful solution. If the PCs do opt for a fight, Prihayn fights valiantly to protect Duneshadow and defeat the disrespectful thieves, favoring ranged powers for several rounds before descending to dispatch foes with his claws. If he detects evil among the PCs, he fights to kill, but otherwise he seeks only to drive off or subdue the PCs. If reduced to 50 or fewer Hit Points, he denounces the PCs loudly and flees combat—he may attempt to rescue Duneshadow from captivity at a later date, if you see fit.</p><blockquote><h4>Prihayn Ti Huet - CREATURE 18</h4><br>Male simurgh (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 295)<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +32</blockquote><p><b>Deception:</b> The PCs can Lie to Prihayn about why they seek Duneshadow with a successful DC 42 Deception check. You’ll need to judge if their lie is potentially compelling to the simurgh, and if it’s not, the PCs need a critical success to fool him and gain his permission to bring Duneshadow back to Katapesh. If the PCs fail, they can still attempt diplomacy, but they take a –2 circumstance penalty to their checks since they’ve tested the simurgh’s patience.</p><p><b>Diplomacy:</b> Prihayn begins this encounter with an unfriendly attitude, unless one of the PCs is obviously a worshipper of Shelyn, in which case the simurgh begins with an indifferent attitude. If the PCs wish to abscond with Duneshadow without provoking a fight from the simurgh, they need to attempt a DC 42 Diplomacy check first to Make an Impression in hopes of increasing the simurgh’s attitude to friendly. If Prihayn starts out unfriendly, the PCs need to critically succeed at this Diplomacy check to do so. During the conversation in which the PCs speak to Prihayn to Make an Impression but before the Diplomacy check is rolled, keep track of the topics and themes the PCs use to appeal to the simurgh, and once the conversation is over, allow certain PCs to attempt additional skill checks to reduce the Diplomacy check DC to Make an Impression. A PC who demonstrates reverence for Shelyn can attempt a DC 35 Religion check; a PC who demonstrates talent for art can attempt a DC 33 Crafting or Performance check, and a PC who displays an understanding and respect for animals can attempt a DC 37 Nature check. With each successful check, the Diplomacy check DC to Make an Impression is reduced by 1 (or by 2 for each critical success on these checks). If the PCs manage to make Prihayn friendly, with a successful DC 36 Diplomacy check to Request his permission, he allows them to take Duneshadow to Katapesh—if the PCs manage to make him helpful, he automatically grants his permission.</p><p><b>Intimidation:</b> An attempt to Coerce the simurgh requires a DC 42 Intimidation check. On a critical success, Prihayn allows for Duneshadow to be taken without repercussion. On a success, he’ll allow it, but will then attempt a rescue operation for the camel 2d4 days later—in which case the Union of Breeders sides once more with the Scarlet Triad out of spite for the PCs, who they feel betrayed them. On a failure, the simurgh attacks.</p><p><b>Compromise:</b> If the PCs and the simurgh can’t come to an agreement but avoid a fight, Prihayn sighs and suggests a compromise. If the PCs agree to create a work of art commemorating Duneshadow’s majesty for the simurgh to keep and can convince him that Duneshadow will be treated well (this is automatically successful as long as the PCs are polite and not obviously evil; otherwise, it requires a successful DC 35 Diplomacy check), Prihayn will allow them to escort Duneshadow to the city. The simurgh gives the PCs a week to craft a work of art; doing so requires either a Crafting check to create a physical piece of artwork or a Performance check to create a song, dance, or other form of entertainment. Prihayn agrees to meet with the PCs at sunrise in 1 week at a secluded cove just north of Katapesh for delivery of the artwork, at which point a PC must attempt a DC 40 Craft or Performance check to appease the simurgh. If this results in a failure, Prihayn demands Duneshadow’s return within another week—this may give the PCs enough time to secure the Union’s vote before the simurgh takes matters into its own hands.</p><p><b>Rewards:</b> If the PCs deliver Duneshadow to Zulran, he awards them the bounty of 1,000 gp, along with a set of <i>greater horseshoes of speed</i> in thanks for being able to secure such a spectacular creature.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs manage to deliver Duneshadow to Zulran, grant them 80 XP.

The wealth that the Scarlet Triad earned from slavery was readily converted into arms and armor to equip its growing mercenary force, and once the Scarlet Triad had enough political clout, it leaned on the Order for ever more exploitative deals. The Order has suffered in these negotiations, further emboldening the Scarlet Triad and encouraging it to further intimidate the smiths to ensure their support in the Council of Guilds—until they are just another pawn in the Scarlet Triad’s growing stranglehold of Katapesh.</p><p>The Scarlet Triad still engages in the occasional criminal act against the Order—either to secure pricey resources at a discount or to reinforce the pecking order. For unfortunate smelter and ingot merchant <b>Mekrem Oagli</b> (N male human merchant), who is well known to Satla from previous dealings, both are true. Well known for his ability to secure even rare skymetals for the right price, Mekrem received numerous visits from Jelek Jaziman, one of the Scarlet Triad’s top agents in Katapesh. Jelek made a small down payment for Mekrem to secure samples of a skymetal known as djezet for a secret project (this component was needed to repair the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i>), and when the metal arrived, Jelek showed up with armed bodyguards to demand Mekrem sell the metal for a fraction of the original price. Insulted, Mekrem refused.</p><p>Jelek bitterly paid the original asking price for the djezet, but he could not stand the sting to his pride. Over the weeks that followed, he’s had two Scarlet Triad enforcers, a woman named Weyir and a man named Aanam al-Jebir, secretly harassing Mekrem and working to set him up for a humiliating fall. These two have taken to their task a bit too eagerly, and are enjoying the time spent slowly ruining Mekrem’s business by scaring away customers, stealing or sabotaging shipments, and—most recently—framing him for embezzling from his guildmates and engaging in the black market sale of deadly and poisonous ores. When evidence of Mekrem’s alleged misdeeds came to light, the guild withdrew its support entirely, leaving Mekrem in a desperate position indeed.</p>","_id":"yDy7PcaP7pssNyAs"}

Doing so involves both clearing his name of embezzlement and recovering his seized property. Once the PCs feel they’ve investigated things as far as possible, tally the number of clues they secured. If it is 3 or higher, the PCs gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the checks below. It it’s 6 or higher, this increases to +4. If it’s 9 or higher, or if the PCs capture one or both of the Scarlet Triad enforcers alive and secure their confessions, the PCs automatically succeed after spending the necessary time.</p><p>So long as the PCs secured any evidence of the Scarlet Triad framing Mekrem for embezzlement, a trio of representatives from the Fraternal Order of the Anvil agrees to meet with the PCs in short order and listen to their testimony. With a successful DC 35 Diplomacy, Society, or appropriate Lore check, a PC can use the evidence to convince the representatives of Mekrem’s innocence. On a critical success, the guild also dispatches workers to help track down some of Mekrem’s goods and tools. On a failure, the Order is willing to reconsider, but only so long as someone pays a 500-gp reinstatement fee (which Mekrem can’t afford). On a critical failure, the guild denies the appeal.</p><p>Once reinstated, Mekrem just needs help setting up again. This provides the PCs a special downtime activity for which they can attempt a DC 35 Crafting, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Mercantile Lore check to track down the missing wares or help set up the shop again. The PCs need to earn three such successes (two if the Order agreed to help), after which the Silver Ewe is back in business.</p><p><b>Reward:</b> Once Mekrem’s shop is restored, he is happy to lend his crafting expertise to the PCs’ cause. He can use his extensive trade connections to secure a small quantity of adamantine or orichalcum—enough for him to fashion armor, a weapon, or other item at market price, or he can give the PCs 1,000 gp after a week of resumed work and recovering his lost assets.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> If the PCs restore Mekrem’s reputation, grant them 80 XP. If they help him reestablish and reopen the Silver Ewe, grant them an additional 40 XP.</p>","_id":"zT9f8aPBHfpJmZtj"}

Several leather-bound journals sit atop the desk.</blockquote><p>The chest of drawers contains six different outfits of fine clothing as well as four much simpler outfits designed for physical training and exercise. Among the modest other possessions are five journals providing a detailed look into Uri Zandivar’s past 12 years operating the Scarlet Triad in Katapesh, including the Scarlet Triad’s original foundation by Mengkare as scouts for his Glorious Endeavor, the frustration with reduced funding from Hermea forcing the Scarlet Triad’s increasingly public shift into slave trading, coercive measures taken to better control rivals in Katapesh, concerns about the end of slavery in Absalom, and increasingly risky plans with Uri’s unnamed sister to confront Mengkare himself and establish the Scarlet Triad as its own entity and not, in Uri’s words, “slaves to gather slaves.” The journal hints that these plans are tied to an unnamed artifact referenced only as the “Orb.” This is, of course, the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i>. Uri takes care never to mention his sister or the Orb by name, but the implication that it can be used to confront Mengkare and claim the city of Promise as a base of operations for the Scarlet Triad is unmistakable. The last few entries in the journal indicate that the repair work for the Orb has been completed and that it is currently in transit to Uri’s sister in Promise, and bemoan the fact that Uri “couldn’t use the amber bauble to take the short route through Vengegate to Promise quite yet”—a clear hint toward where the final gate in Alseta’s Ring might lead. In fact, the final entry in the journal concerns the PCs themselves. Once Mengkare “falls into line,” Uri writes, “we won’t need to worry about what he might think about our use of Alseta’s Ring, and the heroes who’ve been using it should be our next targets. That they’re active here in Katapesh makes it even more convenient—let me know when it’s safe to make my move, and I’ll take them down!”</p><p>If the PCs invaded the Pyramid without first seeing the Scarlet Triad censured, these journals can prove the Scarlet Triad’s illegal activities and, if presented to the Pactmasters, can exonerate the PCs of any crimes committed in the course of invading the Red Pyramid.</p>","_id":"zsZrRdKmmcvddiIa"}
