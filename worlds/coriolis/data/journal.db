The planet contains lush oasis gardens, extreme temperature variations, vast deserts, and a population with a soft spot for philosophy, mathematics, and beautif</h3><p><strong>Dabaran is a</strong> binary system, but Dabaran-B is so small that it can hardly be spotted on its fast course past the gigantic Dabaran-A. The main star is a red giant with few satellites, but the rock planet Dabaran is the only one with a sizeable population. There are some gas mines on the enormous Salamanx and a research installation on the boiling hot Arara.</p><h4>HOME OF THE DARS</h4><p>The arid Dabaran is home to a flourishing class of nobles living in oasis gardens, domed palaces and ravine seraglios. Regardless of whether they are emirs, ferik, pashas or sultans, nobles should be addressed using the royal prefix ”dar” or ”dari”, and the same term is used when speaking of their emirates. The dars are tangled up in a constant struggle to top one another in competitions of art, knowledge and wealth. The race for perfection takes on all sorts of forms, from intricate mosaics and palaces to shining, mechanical nightingales and owls. Dabaran was mostly spared the horrors of the Portal Wars. The planet was not hit by any major bombardment, and the dars had no fleets with which to engage in the fighting. Concentrated efforts instead went into securing the planet’s self-sustainability, fortifying the oasis domes and stopping the spread of the contagious hate and suspicion that held the rest of the Horizon in a chokehold. In Lotus, the temple city, alliances and marriages were formed to safeguard the frail peace and further progress and enlightenment.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PERPETUAL THIRST</h5><p>The peace has lasted to this day, but the larger dars have begun competing over the planet’s most important resource – water. Water is rich in the lowlands around the equator, in underground springs and rivers, but the highlands, where many of the royal courts have their oasis domes, are dry, and water is something one must drill deep for. This has spawned a large, lucrative water rights market, with transactions in the form of either birr or marriage. More and more oasis domes are being constructed, and this has led to physical confrontations over wells and pipelines.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/algol_tanker.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">Water carrier loading precious cargo from the Khouro Oasis.</p><br /><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE WATER WARS</h5><p>Countess dari-Evadires has always controlled a large water reserve in the northern badlands, and her three oasis domes have prospered while the surrounding oases are slowly drying up. With support from the pasha of Dar Bouti, the other nearby emirs have contracted a small army of mercenaries to secure the pumping stations in the area once and for all. Dari-Evadires has, however allied herself with an external benefactor and has access to defense systems, mercenaries of her own, and brand new faction tech. The hostilities have destroyed two oasis domes so far, and are on the verge of spilling over the hills and down into the lowlands.</p></div><p></p><h4>ZENITHIAN ARROGANCE</h4><p>The Consortium, with Parr and the Colonial Agency at the forefront, has started to take an interest in the rich soils of the lowlands. With permission from emir Karabah of Lotus, several multi-farms have been founded on the slopes of the Yeva Valley. Pumping stations and colossal crawlers are slowly taking over the valley – destroying it, according to many – and this has resulted in dust storms sweeping out towards the neighboring dars. Rumors have it that the Zenithians are attempting to drill their way into the Wound, which is located just north of the Yeva Valley – why else would they have mobilized Parr-Nestera’s attack brigades?</p><h4>DABARAN CALM</h4><p>The Dabarans are a calm and thoughtful people. It is not for nothing that the Circle of Seekers has their headquarters for the Horizon on Dabaran. For a while, the Seekers were on their way to becoming a faction, which would have given Dabaran a voice in interstellar politics, but this never came to be as large parts of the cult were assimilated into the Church of the Icons. The Dabarans nowadays work through the Church to get their voices heard, if they involve themselves at all. As long as the bulk haulers from Mira via Kua arrive, not many are bothered, however.</p><p>The Dabaran calm is also present in daily life – at least for the privileged. Art, mathematics, fine mechanics, and philosophy are valued highly. In the oasis domes, many practice a form of topiary called botanotechne, the practice of shaping trees and bushes into beautiful art using both sculpts and physical knives. To the plebeians, who often live and work under slave-like conditions in barracks in the lowlands or underground facilities by the oasis domes, life is instead a calm but constant toil. According to Dabaran thought, this will also lead to fulfillment, if of another sort. Certain voices are now being raised saying that the life of the plebeians is far from easy, however.</p><h1>THE PLANET DABARAN</h1><hr /><p>Dabaran is a world full of contrasts – the lowlands are rich and warm, while the cold deserts in the highlands are almost sterile. The highlands experience extreme temperatures, and although the dars’ climate reactors have increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to even out the differences, they can still differ as much as 60 degrees C between day and night. The summers are desert hot, and the winters are the opposite. The outer farmlands require sculpted crops or oasis domes.</p><p>The lowlands are warm and more even when it comes to temperature, with open palaces, cities and farms. The larger cities are located here, as well as the planet’s only ocean</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>CARAVAN AND SHUTTLE</h5><p>A Dabaran travels in style. Small, extravagant shuttles for the rich rush back and forth between the larger oases and dome cities, and are also used for transport up into orbit. Only the larger spaceports allow traders to land planet side, and they are often located far from the oases and cities.</p><p>The most exalted of the dars often travel in slow moving land caravans. In the lowlands, gravcraft resembling small, floating palaces are used, followed by an entourage of courtesans, servants, Algolan elephants and Miran full bloods. Huge ground crawlers are instead used on the plains, swarmed by a fleet of smaller vehicles like ants around a termite queen.</p></div><h4>THE IRON STORMS</h4><p>The highlands are plagued at regular intervals by red iron storms, sometimes referred to as the ”face of the Judge”. In the iron-rich deserts, a ground charge builds up, pulling microscopic sand particles up into the atmosphere and then throwing them across the plains. The charged particles find their way into every nook and cranny of vehicles and exos, and can even affect shuttle traffic departing for orbit. The storms sometimes last for days. The Mathematical Institute in Daddah regularly issues warning predictions about coming storms.</p><h4>THE CLOUD CITY</h4><p>The Shariqah emirate stands out from the other dars of Dabaran. Instead of constructing an oasis dome, emira Yossipa dari-Shariqah created a flying city called the Cloud City. The city floats above the equator of the planet on an elliptical base covered with several oasis domes. The Cloud City has become a focal point for gamblers among Dabaran’s upper classes as well as from the rest of the Horizon. There are always grav racing, shah tournaments, and other events taking place here. The wealth of the Cloud City has attracted the attention of the Syndicate, which has established themselves here through intermediaries.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>DESDEMODU</h4><p>The cold badlands are home to the slow and wagging desdemodu. Since ancient times, they have been revered for their wisdom by the seekers of the Lotus. The strange horns of the desdemodu have become a sought-after aphrodisiac in other systems over the last few years, and poacher companies have made some successful attempts at hunting and killing desdemodu. This is, of course, a crime that cannot be tolerated, and the latifs have retaliated brutally whenever they have apprehended poachers.</p></div><h4>THE WOUND</h4><p>To the nobles of Dabaran, Lotus is the Icons’ capital on the planet. The city was constructed by the Seekers next to the mysterious Wound, a chasm whose volcanic depths are yet to be measured. The Wound is said to be of Portal Builder origin, but there are no obvious artifact finds in the area that could prove it. Several expeditions have disappeared in the darkness of the Wound. To settle the matter once and for all, the Foundation recently sent a team of xeno-archaeologists to the site.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE JADE MONKEY</h5><p>Just south of the city of Merkab-al-Kour lie the Galrada steppes, an area of the badlands conquered by bio sculpted steppe grass. The local nomads tell stories about a statue made of jade, a stone not naturally found on Dabaran. The statue is said to depict King Karak, a nature spirit in the shape of a gigantic ape. Karak is supposedly going to wake if the nomads come under threat from newcomers on the steppes. An excavation site in the Merkab ravine led by the Zenithian Markadu company has recently run into problems – broken gear, employees going missing, and interrupted communications.</p></div><h4>DAR BAHRI</h4><p>The metropolis of the lowlands, on the beaches of the Bahri Sea, is Dabaran’s unofficial hub. Lords and ladies come here to mingle, form pacts and settle disputes in the sun-drenched beach pavilions constructed by emir Rahmalan. The city stretches far into the distance above the beach promenade. White houses, villas and palaces are spread out among olive gardens, sculpted pine groves and cliff sides plummeting into the sea. On the edges of the city, the luxury gives way to narrow alleys and small brown, red and whitewashed houses. The spaceport and the lodgings for the thousands of plebeians, who serve the masters of the city, are hidden behind the mountain, which the city lies on.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LAW OF THE LATIFS</h5><p>The latifs are the planetary police force that maintain law and order on Dabaran, patrolling both the cities and the plains in fast, state-of-the-art gravcraft. Only the factions’ secret tech can measure up to the vehicles of the latifs. Much of the latifs resources go towards policing the plebeians, who are often immigrants from the systems along the Dabaran circle. After the riots in Lotus a couple of cycles ago, the latifs have been extra vigilant. There are rumors going around about agitators having arrived from the Conglomerate.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SAILING PALACE</h5><p>One of the eight wonders of the Horizon is the Sailing Palace constructed in the highland desert outside of Dar Bahri. The palace is actually a high sky tower with multiple terraces, masts, and steeples. Every day, sails are hoisted on the different terraces to make the tower turn slowly in the desert wind. When Dar Sakam Bahri passed away, black sails were hoisted for a whole cycle. Today, the white sails are back, but the tower is used as the dars’ mausoleum.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>NIGHTINGALES AND SHAH</h4><p>The Dabarans are known for the aptitude for fine engineering, such as the hand-built luxury vehicles of Metri, the beautiful garments created at Il-Aahls or the mechanical nightingales of master watchmaker Ingios Gharbigah. The nightingales are meticulously crafted wonders of gears and springs and are often given as luxurious gifts.</p><p>Dabaran shah is a complex variant of regular shah and the boards themselves are often works of art, patterned and decorated like the interiors of the oasis domes.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"KsH7Aq4yHG8htMZ8","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264796,"modifiedTime":1680376264796,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"0S8I42XxYWS8R5Ea"}

The system has an invaluable strategic position and is home to the space station Coriolis and the rulers of mankind. But Kua is more than that. This chapter will describe the different planets and regions of the system, from the jungle world that shares its name with the star itself to the emptiness of the Rimward Reach.</h3><p><strong>The Kua System</strong> is without a doubt the most important system of all. The Coriolis station is the seat of political power, and the Zenithian culture is molded in the palaces on Kua below, slowly spreading to and dominating the rest of the Horizon. The system is also a miniature version of the Horizon as a whole. Under the surface, it is rife with conflict – between Zenithian landowners and Firstcome workers on Kua, or between the struggling prospector clans and the traditional nomads in the Rimward Reach. Spies, assassins, and agents from every faction gather in the system. Coriolis and the Consortium are the dominant players in the system, but their authority is challenged by everything from tiny smuggler gangs to whole regions, such as the independent Rimward Reach that is growing stronger day by day.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE PLANETS OF KUA</h4><p>This chapter will detail the most important locations in the Kua system. Starting from the star and counting outwards, the planets of Kua are:</p><ul><li><strong>LUBAU</strong> – The desert world closest to the star.</li><li><strong>JINA</strong> – A hostile world with only one small colony.</li><li><strong>KUA</strong> – The green planet that takes its name from the star.</li><li><strong>THE ASTEROID BELT</strong> – Worked by prospectors.</li><li><strong>XENE</strong> – A gas giant in the depths of which the Emissaries are supposed to have originated.</li><li><strong>SURHA</strong> – An ice planet that smugglers and pirates call home.</li><li><strong>THE RIMWARD REACH</strong> – Inhabited by free-minded pilgrims and entrepreneurs.</li></ul></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/Kua_systemet_kua.webp\" /></div><hr /><ul><li>@JournalEntry[Lubau]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Jina]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Kua]</li><li>@JournalEntry[The Monolith]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Xene]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Surha]</li><li>@JournalEntry[The Rimward Reach]</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"_id":"iE5uICsHOb10jxn9","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265252,"modifiedTime":1680376265252,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"0VIjt4Zx9gviKGJH"}

Mighty temples, Icon churches and cloister palaces preside in gilded bliss in the hearts of the planet’s city-states. Pilgrims and merchants flock to the planet, as does their protectors and exploiters. Mira is full of Firstcome wonders: winding pilgrim trails, the floating traffic in the Icon City, ascetic monks in the forgotten valleys of Menau, and much more. The Horizon’s best grav projectors are also from Mira – made in the legendary Chelebs dockyards.</p><p>Mira is a trinary system. There is a second star called Mira-B, or Antmira, and a third called Mira-C, or Menau. Both Antmira and Menau have planets suitable for human habitation, but they are nowhere near as rich as the planet Mira. Trigon in Antmira is an industrialized world that seems to be of more interest to the Zenithian factions than to the Mirans themselves. Menau is remote and home to scattered colonies and temples belonging to the Circle of Seekers.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch13/mira5 copy.webp\" /></div><p class=\"centerJournalText\">The Dhol Guard of the Icon City</p><h4>THE CRADLE OF COLONIZATION</h4><p>The city-states of Mira are the cradle of Firstcome colonization and considered by many to be its pinnacle – a loose federation of states that have enjoyed centuries of peaceful competition. Today, power is shared between the Church of the Icons, the Cities and the Chelebs-Menau family. The Church controls Icon City from high up in the flying Temple City. The other large cities on the planet, like Bandar Asul, Tifret, and Cimoran, are ruled by local courts, but the Church maintains a presence everywhere through their preachers, bureaucrats, and the warrior nuns of the Weeping Matriarch.</p><p>The Chelebs-Menau family shines like a mighty sun across the dockyards in the Icon City from their floating palace high above the Intrapelagic Sea. In recent years, the Chelebs have formed strong ties with the Zenithian Hegemony, and rumors whisper about a coming marriage between the builder masters and one of the purest and most exalted Hegemony families, which would create a blood bond across the whole Horizon. The Weeping Matriarchy is an alliance of convents that are responsible for most of the Church’s security on Mira and Antmira. The Triumvirate of Sisters, appointed for life, controls the Matriarchy.</p><p>Okra Darma is the closest thing to the Syndicate the Mirans have – a criminal network that lives off robberies and gullible or frightened pilgrims visiting the Icon City. Okra Darma’s headquarters are said to be hidden in the deep ravines on distant Menau, but their presence in the Icon City is anything but discreet.</p><h4>PILGRIM TRAILS</h4><p>Pilgrim’s trails, paths, channels and all manner of vehicles that ever so slowly transport pilgrims across the holy lands criss-cross Mira and Menau. Neither pilgrims nor Mirans can see the point in rushing – the voyage is often a goal in itself. If speed is required, there is usually a dhol available nearby, and those too frail to walk can ride dromedons on Mira or the wooly, grip-hoofed cria on Menau.</p><p>A pervasive myth in the whole system is that of the Ensnarer, or Yal-Shir, who is said to seduce and prey on unworthy pilgrims. The more obscure or sparsely traveled a trail is, the more ”active” the Ensnarer is. Several pilgrim groups disappear every year on the Yadaman trail between the Icon City and the Valley of Monuments, something that neither private mercenaries nor the Matriarchy have been able to stop.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"XbA65p8bA1Nijd6B","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266046,"modifiedTime":1680376266046,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"0eQxKq4Uesa71ZK3"}

The rulers use the faith as a political tool to control their subjects. The head of the masked clergy, Aremerat, is presented as chosen directly by the Icons. It is an insular system, and news from the rest of the Horizon is subject to strict control and censoring. Emigration is not permitted, but the Consortium and a few other groups have been allowed to establish themselves here in recent years.</p><p>Sadaal is a binary system. Both stars, Sadaal and Bahram, have one planet each with good conditions for human settlement. High mountains and dry steppes dominate Sadaal, while Bahram is covered in oceans, marshes and wide plains of farmland.</p><h4>THE EIGHT WISDOMS</h4><p>The most powerful group in Sadaal is without question the hierocrats in Amesha Spenta, The Eight Wisdoms. These high priests interpret the words of Aremerat and are the de facto rulers in all matters. Each of the eight Ameshas represents one Icon and leads a sect devoted to the domain of that Icon, as it is understood in Sadaal. The ninth Icon, the Whisperer – called the Faceless One elsewhere – has no representative in Amesha Spenta.</p><p>The Ameshas work as a political force to maintain and expand their power. Institutes, bureaus and departments grow and shrink, priests win or lose reputation – it is a constant shadow play that often takes a hard toll on the population.</p><p>Sadaalians generally live strict, humble lives. They work to feed their families. They wear their talismans and thank Aremerat at dawn and dusk for the great civilization he has created. They meet their confessor at least once a week to confess and scrutinize their actions. Moderation guides all things. There are no decadent pleasures available to common people on Sadaal.</p><p>Life on Bahram is somewhat different. Farmers are moving into the big cities to share in the new economy, and a middle class is forming. New districts crop up around shipyards and factories. Bigotry is receding and the citizens no longer fear change.</p><h4>DAHARAB AND THE CONSORTIUM</h4><p>The Daharab dockyards are the center of Consortium power on Bahram. They are located in the Newlands, a group of islands where foreign companies are allowed to establish themselves. Components of enormous freighters are constructed in the huge factories of the yards and then taken up into orbit for assembly.</p><p>Daharab is a bustling city. The social strata are much more nuanced here compared to other parts of the planet and the system. There is more money to be made here, but also a lot of people living in actual poverty – something that hardly exists outside of the Newlands. Another indication of the loosening of control in the Newlands is the growing influx of plebeians, drawn here from across the Horizon to work in the factories.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch13/sadaal_byrakrat.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"w9eAS7w7zLNEH4w0","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266152,"modifiedTime":1680376266152,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"0fsHYtNHtj8Qgus6"}

The planet is known for its heavy industry, deep mines, vast wastelands and draconian faction and Consortium-affiliated rulers. The industrial expansion has taken its toll on both the planet and its inhabitants, leaving the people divided between company loyalists and rebels.</h3><p><strong>Algol is a</strong> trinary system containing the stars Algol, Persei, and Rhaas. Algol and Persei circle each other in destined passion, while Rhaas, the forgotten lover, watches from afar. As the stars are white, only Algol-Persei space contains habitable worlds: Yavan, Algol, Ermenu, and Taus. A few worlds orbit the distant Rhaas, but house only a handful of mining colonies.</p><h4>CHILDREN OF THE DEMON STAR</h4><p>Across the Horizon, Algol’s reputation reflects its unspoken name: “The Demon Star”. It was thought to be a haunted place only visited by the desperate and the greedy. The first colonists were probably aware of the stories, but ignored the system’s bad reputation to exploit its rich concentration of metals and minerals, and settled in the temperate belts on the planet Algol. When the Portal Wars raged across the Horizon, Algol was hit hard. Many cities were destroyed during a campaign of orbital bombardments remembered today as the “Year of the Flaming Tears”. The arrival of the Zenithians revitalized the wounded world.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>ALGOLAN ECLIPSES</h5><p>Algol and Persei rotate close to each other and shine together on the planet Algol. During the day, both can be seen as suns from the planet, quickly changing positions. There is a solar eclipse every third day when one of the stars passes behind the other. On rare occasions, both stars are obscured by the moon Barir, leaving only the faint light from Rhaas in the sky – an omen of misfortune and death.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CONSORTIUM AND THE REBELS</h5><p>The Consortium is the largest faction on Algol. With birr, grav cranes, and Vulcan might, the companies seized control of the ruined cities and began extracting the planet’s natural riches. The infrastructure was repaired and expanded, but vulgar displays of wealth next to growing shantytowns have become the face of the Consortium on Algol. The Zenithian Hegemony has also invested in several of the planet’s cities, thanks to the Algolan diaspora in the shadow of the Monolith. All Algolans do not kneel before their Zenithian overlords, however – the brutal treatment of the planet and the population fuels resistance and revolt. The rebels keep to the remote highlands, the forests of the taiga, and the frozen deserts near the planet’s poles.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> YIHANNA AND THE MONSTER</h5><p>The largest conflict on the planet is located in the metropolis formed by the three cities Akhandar-O-Sharif, Yasul, and Merkate, known as the AYM metropolis. The rebels’ headquarters, Haven, is located just south of the city. Colonial governor Abbaras has proposed taking out the rebels using strategic nukes from Gevennon-P “the Monster” Quam, but the high risk of fallout has stopped this. Conventional warfare is too expensive, resulting in a long shah game of nekatra and strike teams against the rebel meme drones and war elephants.</p><h4>INDUSTRY AND NATURE</h4><p>Life on Algol is tough – hard work in the factories in the cities or hard work in the mines and logging camps in the wilderness. But just like the two suns chasing each other across the heavens, the toils of the day give way to the pleasures of the night. The entertainment districts in the cities are filled with courtesan houses, pit fights and grav racing, and things like kohôl, opor, arrash, and Substance O, the latest drug, help the people forget their worries. The bleak countryside mirrors the hard lives of the population – endlessly stretching gravel plains, empty tundra, high mountain ranges, and deep, dark forests. Pioneers and prospecting companies defy the hostile landscape to search for precious metals and ore veins, hoping for that one big find – as the saying goes: “a miner in the morning can be a pasha by night”.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE SLAVERS</h4><p>The only group that benefits from the unrest on the planet and in the system are the Algolan slavers. The Church’s ban on slavery doesn’t seem to deter them. They are active mainly in the shantytowns where beautiful and strong young men and women are kidnapped and sold to the dars on Dabaran, the factory islands in the Conglomerate or in the Newlands on Sadaal. Large bulk haulers hidden on the edges of the Cloud belt in Rhaas’ northern heliopause ship the slaves off world.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CRATER FIELDS</h5><p>The bombardments during the “Age of Flaming Tears” left many areas scarred with deep craters, such as the wide Merchant Lake or the pit fields at Tasuga. Those who lost their lives there haunt the crater fields; evil dybbuk and kafras are said to possess miners and rebels passing through the area. The soil and air here are sometimes toxic, even though the bombardment wasn’t thermonuclear.</p><h1>THE PLANET ALGOL</h1><hr /><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/slavjägare5.webp\" /></div><p class=\"centerJournalText\">Slave traders preparing departure from the Tanzim Highlands</p><p>Algol is the hub of the system and most people today, city dwellers and rebels alike, still live in its two temperate belts. Old and newer cities like Yasul, Akhandar-O-Sharif, Belem, and Yousfana crowd together, surrounded by wasteland on all sides. Colonies and mines exist across the entire planet, and are common throughout the whole system, on moons and asteroids as well as in the big cloud belt.</p><h4>MENGOL’S MINING ARCHIPELAGO</h4><p>The Mengol Sea used to be a place full of life and long beaches, with Akhandar-O-Sharif towering above the waters like a shining pearl. This all changed when the Consortium arrived. The sea floor was rich with nodules of almost pure metals, but the costs of prospecting were high. By blowing up the tongue of land separating the sea from the Yafsa Desert, Mengol was drained of water and the desert became an enormous salt marsh devoid of life.</p><p>Today, the name of the engineer who came up with the idea, Salbara, is a common curse word on Algol. The Mengol sea floor is a wasteland covered in mining units, chotts, and shantytowns where the plebeians live in squalor and despair.</p><h4>THE TANZIM HIGHLANDS</h4><p>The Tanzim massif is an inhospitable plateau rising above the atmosphere. The plateau can be used to enter orbit. The Consortium started to build a gravway from Akhandar to the plateau, but the rebels sabotaged it. Today, drone batteries and combat satellites from Gevennon-P patrol the skies, preventing anyone from approaching. The old spaceport on Rhaas-Tanzim is deserted and in ruins, but the whole massif is riddled with slaver dens and hidden opor farms.</p><h4>AKHANDAR</h4><p>Akhandar-O-Sharif is one of the oldest cities on Algol, although it doesn’t look the part, as much of the city was destroyed during the Portal Wars. The Consortium has launched several large restoration projects on top of the old ruins, and shining sky towers, spires, Dabaran globe complexes, and the newly finished Crater dome have given Akhandar a new face. Ruins from the old days can only be seen in the poor districts and shantytowns.</p><p>Akhandar is divided into blocks, each controlled by a single corporation or faction through the Khasar Council. The chaotic shantytowns surrounding the city are left to their own devices, as is the Undercity. Slavers and opor cartels control these areas, and the police only come here when they are hunting rebels.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE KHASARS</h5><p>The city’s ruling council of corporate bureaucrats and factionaries, the khasars maintain control over their blocks through their various private police forces, such as the Khasa Guard or Hyperion’s Granite Watch. The Legion-trained Rebel hunters are used for military operations, armed and equipped with the latest Consortium tech, such as grav belts, combat gravs, and vomit fields.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE PRAYER TOWERS</h5><p>A famous Algolan architectural feature is the prayer towers that have crowned temples and churches since the days of the Firstcome. The prayer tower in Akhandar is the city’s highest building, designed by the architect Yassa dol-Gardi. Yassa was inspired by a visit to the hollow cliffs of Qusuf that have been turned into natural musical instruments by eons of erosion. The Gardi prayer tower contains many holes and vents that carry sermons and prayers out across the district without electrical amplification, and the wind creates sad, rolling notes when it hits the tower from the right angles. Prayer is the most important of the Church’s nine sacred rites in Algol. All across the system, society grinds to a halt during dawn and dusk prayers.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SOUK OF LOST SOULS</h5><p>In the shadows of the Undercity lies the Souk of Lost Souls – the slave market. Traders from the different slaver clans gather here, cloaked in bouras and hidden behind thermal visors and voice changers, to do business with each other, the Syndicate, the Serpent or other shady organizations. Most of the plebeians working as servants in the wealthier districts of Akhandar are actually slaves with “laundered” identities. These “plebeians” can be exported across the Horizon, avoiding the ban on slavery imposed on many worlds.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/algol_daglönare_gruvor.webp\" /></div><p class=\"centerJournalText\">Slave trade at the Souk of Lost Souls</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ELEPHANT MARKET</h5><p>The large elephant market can be found on the outskirts of the trade district. Brightly colored tents shade the animals that, as much as the prayer towers, have become synonymous with Algol. Everything from lively dwarf elephants and majestic white madra elephants to working animals like carrier elephants or the woolly steppe breeds can be found here. Elephant Day is celebrated once a year, when all the animals are beautifully decorated and painted.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"PHR96cU1pFImANIT","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264761,"modifiedTime":1680376264761,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"0j5dReQfg9ZhtTeK"}

You can use the sector as a follow-up to the Zhar Baghra mini scenario or independently.</h3><p><strong>The PCs can</strong> end up in the valley for many different reasons. Perhaps they are here to look for the statuette of Zhar Baghra, or maybe they are here to excavate the tower ruins. They could be here bringing supplies to the archaeologists, or as hired guns for them or the loggers. They could also have been hired by the Legion to locate the crash site of their downed fighter prototype.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>Terenganu Valley is located deep in the jungles along the little river and lake that share its name. The water has cut through the sandstone of the plateau and is now running in a deep ravine. The days here have a predictable weather pattern – pounding sun in the morning, usually replaced by pouring rain in the afternoon. The surrounding jungle is full of life and sounds, and the nearby Sogoi tribe Gurghan have plenty of game. The proximity to a Legion training field makes for a lot of sensor and com jamming bleeding into the valley. Communicators work only sporadically.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch15/dalen.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SOGOI VILLAGE</h5><p>The village is located in a clearing and consists of a few domed huts covered in leaves, lichen and twigs. The tribe has some forty members, including children, and is led by the Icon shaman Ixra and the matriarch Yusu-ghan. A Zenithian prophet, Huraman Kahl, has been living here as a guest of the tribe for a while. The Sogoi hunt primarily east of the river, and sometimes on the lake itself using primitive canoes. They avoid Excavation Site 9 as they believe that djinn and djanna live there (Chapter 14).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EXCAVATION SITE 9</h5><p>Archaeology professor Ihana dol-Pranha from the Foundation controls the dig site aided by the three assistants Fara, Kemal, and Yousin. They are assisted by the scout Gathor and a digging drone nicknamed Sysfos. The ruin field is a row of low house foundations covered in tarps against the afternoon rains. The expedition has not been resupplied in a while and is waiting for a transport that is running late.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE TOWER RUINS</h5><p>Three frail tower ruins rise like prehistoric teeth from the jungle. The area is full of blood-sucking mosquitoes, sinkholes and jungle monsters, both according to the Sogoi and Gathor the scout, which makes everyone leave the towers alone. A private expedition tried to investigate the towers in the past, but went missing according to the Sogoi.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE PLATEAU</h5><p>A grey plateau rises above the green jungle below. It is made of a different kind of rock than the surrounding sandstone. If it wasn’t for its steep sides, it would be a perfect landing site for small freighters. The Sogoi claim that evil djinn live in the caves underneath the plateau.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WATERFALL</h5><p>Just next to the waterfall, you will find the only level, open area large enough to set down a spaceship on, unless you want to land on the dig site or the Sogoi village, with all the consequences that would bring.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MARSH</h5><p>Lake Terenganu goes on to become a marsh, home to water buffalo, seabirds and crocodiles. Deep in the marsh lies an almost intact, unsalvaged Legion fighter.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LOGGING STATION</h5><p>Logging station Terenganu is run by the prospector Mustar Kollah and a crew of about twenty tough and taciturn loggers. They cut hardwood in the valley below the plateau and drive it down the river to a larger port farther down. There is a small wooden quay at the logging station as well as Mustar’s pride and joy – the river barge Eufrynde.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The three groups in the valley – the archaeologists, the Sogoi, and the loggers – are heading quickly towards a clash. As of late, the loggers have begun felling trees up on the plateau in an area where the Sogoi’s ancestral spirits rest. The Sogoi are traditionally very careful, and have tried to make the prophet Huraman stop Mustar from working on the plateau, but this has so far yielded no results. When a child in the Sogoi village recently came down with blood fever, many of the villagers – led by the young and proud Kubu-ghan – believed that this was a sign that the spirits are angry – probably provoked both by the archaeologists' digging and the logging on the plateau.</p><h4>PEOPLE IN THE VALLEY</h4><p>The most prominent inhabitants of the valley are the Sogoi leaders, professor dol-Pranha and the prospector Herrah, Mustar’s right hand.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">IXRA, SOGOI SHAMAN</div>@Actor[Ixra, Sogoi Shaman]<div class=\"blueheader\">KUBU-GHAN, SOGOI WARRIOR</div>@Actor[Kubu-Ghan, Sogoi Warrior]<div class=\"blueheader\">PROFESSOR IHANA DOL-PRAHNA, ARCHAEOLOGIST</div>@Actor[Professor Ihana Dol-Prahna, Archaeologist]<div class=\"blueheader\">GATHOR, SCOUT</div>@Actor[Gathor, Scout]<div class=\"blueheader\">HERRAH, PROSPECTOR</div>@Actor[Herrah, Prospector]<h4>TECHNOLOGY AND ARTIFACTS</h4><p>There is not much in the way of special technology in the valley except for Sysfos the drone, a broken grav bike in a shed by the logging station and the loggers' arsenal, five Vulcan carbines and one flamethrower. Valuable objects of art can be found in the ruin field. The statuette of Zhar Baghra (if not found in the previous scenario) is hidden in a cave underneath the plateau (see below).</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>Many things can happen in the valley, possibly leading to clashes between the natives of the valley and the newcomers. Below are a few examples for you to expand upon.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BEAST RAIDS</h5><p>A jungle monster is plaguing the valley. Its territory overlaps with one of the three settlements. People living there could fall prey to the beast, leading to maiming, disappearances or even deaths. The blame could fall on one of the other settlements. What will the consequences be?</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SOGOI STRIKE BACK</h5><p>Enough is enough! The Sogoi are furious that the excavation has awoken the djanna of the woods. Ixra has had a vision telling her that the expedition must be stopped. Has the professor just unearthed something? Or have the PCs found the statuette? This will cause problems for Kubu-ghan who wishes to maintain his friendship with Gathor in order to get to his accelerator rifle.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ARRIVAL OF SASORA</h5><p>Parts of the Sasora brigade arrive from the north, led by the mercenary Yvera. She is a paragon of the people, at least in her own opinion. Her company has been reduced to about ten soldiers, now retreating from the Legion to regroup. They have wounded members who need medical aid and are short on resources. They will use force to get what they want if they have to – the liberation of the people will be stopped by nothing.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE STATUETTE OF ZHAR BAGHRA</h5><p>The Zhar Baghra mini scenario leaves the PCs with coordinates to Terenganu Valley, or to the plateau west of the lake to be precise. An investigation of the area around the plateau reveals a vast network of caverns underneath the valley. Deep in the darkness rests the remains of Doctor Baghra’s expedition, a sentinel (page 331 @Actor[Sentinel]) and some Portal Builder remains.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ASTÛRBAN’S ARCHAEO TROOP</h5><p>Either the discovery of the statuette or the excavation of the Portal Builder ruins has generated a signal intercepted by the xeno-archaeologists of the Astûrban.

Everyone except the Draconites’ lorekeepers and the prophets of the Order of the Pariah has forgotten most of the first two Horizons.</h3><p><strong>To understand the</strong> Third Horizon of today, one needs to know what happened during the Portal Wars and the background of the hostilities between the First and Second Horizon. This is described shortly below for the GM to read.</p><h4>THE FIRST AND SECOND HORIZON</h4><p>The two first Horizons were colonized long before the Third Horizon. The eternal Emperor of Ardha rules the First Horizon, or Terra as it is known there. The Second Horizon was dominated early on by the Symmetry, a caste of mystics. They had fled the tyranny of the First Horizon and colonized the Second Horizon in a series of quick waves. The Symmetry practitioners developed their own political dominance in the Second Horizon to protect themselves from the Emperor. Just as the Third Horizon was discovered and colonization of it began, hostilities broke out between the two older Horizons. The heart of the conflict was competition over natural resources and territory. The long and bitter war left dead stars, silent systems, burned-out planets and rock belts between the two Horizons in its wake. The war became permanent as the First Horizon began to focus on harnessing the power of the Dark between the Stars.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE KEY TO THE HORIZON</h5><p>To both the First and Second Horizon, the Third Horizon was of great strategic importance. Aside for natural riches, the Third Horizon also housesd weak points in the Symmetry’s otherwise almost impenetrable defenses – most obviously, the node in the gas giant Xene. The cult known today as the Circle of Seekers were originally a part of the Symmetry, or rather, what would later become the Symmetry. The Seekers and the Symmetry quickly discovered several nodes in the Third Horizon. A node can create a mystical and physical link between systems in a fashion that falls outside of the technology and methods used by the Portal Builders. Using the nodes, the Seekers could stay in contact with their mystic allies in the Second Horizon, but when the two cults parted ways, the use of the nodes stopped and the knowledge of their mysteries faded.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Timeline</div><table><thead><tr><th>CORIOLIS CYCLE</th><th>EVENT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>-1,000 (roughly)</td><td>Zenith and Nadir leave Terra.</td></tr><tr><td>-900 (roughly)</td><td>The portals are discovered in systems close to Terra.

Many portals are damaged by the unchecked use of thermonuclear and antimatter-based weapon systems.</td></tr><tr><td>-99</td><td>Faced with the imminent threat of a full-scale invasion by the First Horizon, a plan is set in motion to isolate the Third Horizon. The few portals that link the First and Third Horizon become targets and are destroyed.</td></tr><tr><td>-98</td><td>After the enemies’ escape route has been cut off, the last of the imperial fleet is caught in the Odacon system and annihilated in the most devastating battle of the whole war.</td></tr><tr><td>-5</td><td>The Zenith finally arrives at a system with a red star – Dabaran.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>THE PORTAL WARS</h4><p>The original conflict that went on to become the Portal Wars was centered around whether the Third Horizon should be allowed independence or if it should be co-ruled by the First Horizon. As the war intensified, the original question was sidelined and many other conflicts that had been simmering in the shadows instead took its place. By proxy, the First and Second Horizon also fought each other during the Portal Wars.</p><p>The titanic weapons used in the war destroyed many of the portals linking the three Horizons together. The portals between the First and Third Horizon were hit the hardest, but also some of the portals connecting different systems within the Third Horizon. The last contact with the First Horizon was intentionally severed by the Order of the Pariah as the last of the Empire’s forces were crushed, and several portals and mystical nodes had been destroyed before that. The Taoan system contains portals to Hamura and Uharu, and a dead portal leading to the First Horizon – or rather, a portal the people of the Third Horizon believe to be dead.</p><h4>NAZAREEM’S SACRIFICE</h4><p>After the Portal Wars had ended, the Order’s holy warriors found that tainted remnants of the Empire still existed in the Horizon. The taint bore the name Nazareem’s Sacrifice. After a wave of diplomacy, the Order managed to unite the Firstcome factions in one last offensive and wipe out the Nazareem – or so they believed.</p><p>Nazareem’s Sacrifice began as an Iconic cult devoted to the mystery of the Dancer. Influenced by the First Horizon, they eventually started to revere an aspect of the Dancer called the Beast. Worship of the Beast mixed well with the extreme ideals of beauty and absolute nihilism of the First Horizon. Only those free of the shackles of morality could achieve perfect beauty. Submission to this cruel movement and its ecstatic revels of perverse pleasures opened doors to unfathomable powers – stemming from the Dark between the Stars.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A DARK PHOENIX</h5><p>Nazareem’s Sacrifice were not totally unprepared for the other factions’ attack. The cult was ready for the coming witch hunt and escaped complete annihilation. In forgotten valleys on Mira, in high mountain caves on Algol, behind the masks of the bureaucrats of Sadaal – the Nazareem are hiding all over the Horizon. Awaiting their resurrection, the cult is at work in the shadows, getting ready. They possess powerful relics – macabre cadaver clocks that will sound when the time of the Nazareem has come. New members are recruited and the group is slowly growing stronger. As the Symmetry’s knowledge disappeared after the Portal Wars and the prophets of the Order have abandoned the mystical ways, the Nazareem are free to use their abilities without fear of discovery.</p><h4>THE ARRIVAL OF THE EMISSARIES</h4><p>During the first years of the Portal Wars, mystical nodes were created all over the Third Horizon as a way for the Second Horizon to enter the First. Nodes opened directly between the Second and First Horizon were immediately destroyed, which made the routes through the Third Horizon necessary.</p><p>The Third Horizon was systematically purged of nodes in the final months of the war, either by imperial agents or by Firstcome factions tired of outside influence over the Third Horizon.</p><p>A few nodes survived, scattered across the systems. One such survivor is the node in the gas giant Xene, a node that operates both ways. There is much fear within the Symmetry that if the First Horizon were to gain access to the node, they could – theoretically – influence the Symmetry with their dark fantasies.</p><p>When a prospector ship made an emergency landing on the Xenian node, the Symmetry seized the opportunity. Their mightiest seers entered a permanent trance and each possessed one of the prospectors. This was a risky maneuver, as it was done both via a node and at such extreme distances. The Dark between the Stars was lurking dangerously close by. The results were as expected – mixed. Of those who sacrificed themselves, only one retained her spirit and kept full control of the host. The darkness forced itself upon the souls of the others, who were all affected to varying degrees. The Emissary who was relatively unharmed travelled to Coriolis to steer the rulers of the Third Horizon in a desirable direction, without revealing either its secret or the existence of the node.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/corioliscrash.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">A group of explorers approaching the ruins of Sah Khoujand.</p><p></p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"ASS4kPAaA9JXEj6v","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264843,"modifiedTime":1680376264843,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"1DbCXqwkf30dC4Mo"}

They want something fast, and with the ability to land planetside. They find a small courier vessel they like, and name it Narzalus.</em></p></div><h4>THE SHIP’S PROBLEM</h4><p>To make your ship feel more unique, you should give it a problem. The problem will not always be active – the GM can activate it using his Darkness Points. Choose from the examples below or use your imagination.</p><ul><li><strong>FAULTY THRUSTERS</strong>: The ship’s thrusters are unreliable, especially when under stress. When the problem is activated, the ship suffers a -1 to Maneuverability, lasting during a combat encounter or some other event requiring dice rolls, such as docking.</li><li><strong>CURSE</strong>: The Icons have turned their gaze away from the ship, making portal jumps and longer space travel dangerous. When the problem is activated, you get a -1 when rolling for a portal jump, and space travel counts as one danger level higher (page 140 @JournalEntry[Chapter 7 - Spaceships &amp; Star Travel]).</li><li><strong>UNRELIABLE SENSORS</strong>: The sensors of the ship are of poor quality. When the problem is activated, all data djinn sensor rolls suffer a -1 during a combat encounter or some other event requiring dice rolls.</li><li><strong>WORN-OUT SHIP COMPUTER</strong>: The ship’s computer has seen better days. When the problem is activated, all pilot rolls suffer a -1 during a fight or some other event requiring dice rolls.</li><li><strong>SLOW ACCELERATOR</strong>: The grav projector’s accelerator unit is slow and unresponsive. When the problem is activated, moving the ship in combat costs one extra EP.</li><li><strong>OBVIOUS SIGNATURE</strong>: The hull reflects radiation, making it easy to spot on sensors. When the problem is activated, all opponents get a +2 to their data djinn rolls to detect the ship.</li><li><strong>ECCENTRIC SHIP INTELLIGENCE</strong>: Requires the feature Ship Intelligence. When the problem is activated, the intelligence will refuse to perform a specific task and instead begin to protest loudly over the ship’s intercom. The effect lasts during a combat encounter, or a few hours.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>The ship Narzalus is built in the Chelebs shipyards on Mira, and is therefore slim and streamlined. Its starting game stats are modified with a +1 to Maneuverability but also a +1 to Signature. The Narzalus is a class III ship and its starting stats are as follows: Maneuverability +1, 5 EP, 6 HP, Signature +1, Armor 5, Speed 2 and up to 10 extra modules.</em></p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>The group thinks that a bickering ship intelligence seems fun, and therefore pick “eccentric ship intelligence” to be the problem of Narzalus.</em></p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 7.6 COST</h4><table><thead><tr><th>CLASS</th><th>BIRR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>I</td><td>100,000</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>200,000</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>1,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>2,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>V</td><td>10,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>MODULES</h4><p>A ship has a number of modules, each one supplying some important function. All spaceships in the Third Horizon have three required modules:</p><ul><li>Bridge</li><li>Reactor</li><li>Graviton Projector</li></ul><p>All other modules are called optional modules. How many of these that can be fitted on a ship depends on the ship’s class. The starting number of modules can be modified by the feature Extra Modules (see below). To serve its purpose, different ships need different combinations of the modules listed below. Small ships can fit few modules, while larger ships usually have plenty of space. The cost of optional modules is added to the ship’s base price – see the adjacent list.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/sadaal_lots.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h4>USING DARKNESS POINTS ON SHIPS</h4><p>Darkness Points can be used during travel and combat in space. Below are effects that the GM can trigger:</p><ul><li><strong>BROKEN SYSTEM</strong>: A system onboard stops working. It could be anything from a weapon system to life support. A TECHNOLOGY or DATA DJINN roll is required to repair it. Costs 3 DP, or 1 DP if the system in question was poorly tended to.</li><li><strong>SHIP PROBLEM</strong>: The ship’s problem is activated. Details are specified in the list of problems above. Costs 2 DP.</li><li><strong>OVERLOAD</strong>: A system is overloaded, either from neglected upkeep or a temporary malfunction. The system stops working for three turns (see Service, below). Costs 1 DP.</li></ul></div><h4>REQUIRED MODULES</h4><ul><li>@Item[Bridge]</li><li>@Item[Reactor]</li><li>@Item[Graviton Projector]</li></ul><h4>OPTIONAL MODULES</h4><ul><li>@Item[Bridge]</li><li>@Item[Cabins - Coffins]</li><li>@Item[Cabins - Standard]</li><li>@Item[Cabins - Suite]</li><li>@Item[Cargo Hold]</li><li>@Item[Chapel]</li><li>@Item[Docking Station]</li><li>@Item[Escape Pods]</li><li>@Item[Graviton Projector]</li><li>@Item[Hangar]</li><li>@Item[Medlab]</li><li>@Item[Mining Station]</li><li>@Item[Reactor]</li><li>@Item[Salvage Station]</li><li>@Item[Service Station]</li><li>@Item[Smuggler's Stash]</li><li>@Item[Stasis Hold]</li><li>@Item[Torpedo and Mine System]</li><li>@Item[Weapon System]</li><li>@Item[Workshop]</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/skoter_hangar_rymdskepp.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>TECH LEVEL</h5><p>Just like regular gear, ship modules and features have a tech level (page 104 @JournalEntry[Chapter 6 - Weapons and Equipment]). Usually, spaceships and their associated technology is of Ordinary tech level (O), but some modules and features are Advanced (A), and some rare ones even Factionary (F). Some modules are restricted (marked *) – to purchase these, someone in the crew must have the talent Licensed (page 73 @Item[Licensed]).</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE IMPORTANCE OF DOCKING STATIONS</h4><p>The Docking Station module, while optional, is almost a necessity for ships above class II. Without it, you won’t be able to dock with space stations or other spaceships, and thus you will need to land in a hangar to enter or exit the ship.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/Missil_torped_rymdskepp.webp\" /></div><h4>FEATURES</h4><p>The last step in creating your ship is picking features. You will start with three features, but you can add more later. There is no limit to how many features you can have, except your personal financial limits. The cost of features depends on the size of the ship. A feature will have its cost listed as a percentage of the ship’s starting cost, usually 10%. Two features results in a cost increase of 20% and so on, see table 7.10.</p><ul><li>@Item[Ablative Armor]</li><li>@Item[Advanced Countermeasures]</li><li>@Item[Advanced Targeting Computer]</li><li>@Item[Advanced Torpedoes]</li><li>@Item[Advanced Weapon System]</li><li>@Item[Advanced Workshop]</li><li>@Item[Antimatter Rockets]</li><li>@Item[Arboretum]</li><li>@Item[Atmospheric Entry]</li><li>@Item[Blessed Ship]</li><li>@Item[Bonus Modules]</li><li>@Item[ED Fields]</li><li>@Item[Ejector]</li><li>@Item[External Cargo]</li><li>@Item[Heavy Armor]</li><li>@Item[Library Database]</li><li>@Item[Precise Thrusters]</li><li>@Item[Reactor Burst]</li><li>@Item[Research Computer]</li><li>@Item[Robust Hull]</li><li>@Item[Salvage Unit]</li><li>@Item[Sensitive Sensors]</li><li>@Item[Ship Intelligence]</li><li>@Item[Ship System]</li><li>@Item[Stealth Technology]</li><li>@Item[Super Sensors]</li><li>@Item[Supercharged reactor]</li><li>@Item[Trauma Lab]</li><li>@Item[Tuned Accelerator]</li><li>@Item[Turbo Projector]</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/rymdskepp2_hangar.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>The group is equipping their ship Narzalus with extra modules (other than the three fixed modules of bridge, reactor and graviton projector) and chooses the following: cabins (4 standard cabins), a chapel, a medlab, a service station (as they expect to be traveling to primitive planets), a stasis hold (to be able to portal jump), a workshop (to analyze artifacts and other findings), a cargo hold, a countermeasure dispenser and an accelerator cannon. They also pick the following features: Atmospheric Entry, Ship Intelligence and Turbo Projector. The Turbo Projector gives the Narzalus Speed 3 and Maneuverability +2.</em></p></div><h4>SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE</h4><p>Your adventures will sooner or later start to wear down your spaceship – micro meteorites or frost damage, a clumsy docking or maybe an uncontrolled landing – it will happen to even the best of crews. Servicing your ship (a <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">technology</strong> test) also resupplies food, drink and other consumables, as well as reactor isotopes, antimatter etc. Your service roll is modified depending on where you are. If you fail the roll, you still pay half the listed cost (table 7.11). You should service you ship after any longer space travel (10 AU or more), short travels that include portal jumping and after every completed scenario.</p><p>If you have a service station onboard, ignore the penalty for doing service in primitive environments. If you have the antimatter rockets feature, service costs are doubled. If you choose not to service your craft, or if you fail the roll, the ship will start to break down – roll on the table to the right to see which systems are affected. For each missed tune-up, the wear effects stack. If you roll the same system twice on the table, it breaks down completely and the ship is disabled until repaired (page 172 @JournalEntry[Space Combat]).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 7.12 SHIP WEAR</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 7.12 Ship Wear]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2D6</th><th>SYSTEM</th><th>EFFECT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2-3</td><td>Sensors</td><td>-1 to sensor rolls</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>Reactor</td><td>-1 EP</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>Thrusters</td><td>-1 to PILOT rolls</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Weapon System</td><td>-1 to RANGED COMBAT rolls</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Graviton Projector</td><td>All actions in space combat cost 1 extra EP.</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>Random Module</td><td>-1 to use if applicable, otherwise reduced functionality decided by the GM.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 7.11 SERVICE COSTS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>ENVIRONMENT</th><th>MODIFIER</th><th>COST</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Smaller space station or space port in primitive settlement, for example on remote, uncivilized planets or farthest out on the system arms.</td><td>-3</td><td>1/500 of ship value</td></tr><tr><td>Standard space stations or space ports in ordinary settlements, for example portal stations or systems with only sparse traffic.</td><td>0</td><td>1/1,000 of ship value</td></tr><tr><td>Large space stations or advanced space ports, for example Coriolis</td><td>+1</td><td>1/2,000 of ship value</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>LIVING WEAR AND TEAR</h5><p>While the ship is getting worn down, lots of less essential systems will also start to malfunction. While not always giving penalties in the game mechanics, they can add some color to the game and help create drama – airlocks closing just a little too slow, flickering lights, unresponsive landing gear, doors refusing to open etc. These problems can be activated using DP (page 56 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]).</p></div><h1>PREMADE SHIPS</h1><hr /><ul><li>@Actor[Scarab - Blockade Runner]</li><li>@Actor[Scarab - Passenger Ship]</li><li>@Actor[Scarab - Standard Model]</li><li>@Actor[Azuk - Patrol Ship Model]</li><li>@Actor[Azuk - Standard Model]</li><li>@Actor[Azuk - Torpedo Ship]</li><li>@Actor[Oryx - Express Freighter]</li><li>@Actor[Oryx - Patrol Ship Model]</li><li>@Actor[Oryx - Standard Model]</li><li>@Actor[Kamruk - Flying Circus]</li><li>@Actor[Kamruk - Mining Model]</li><li>@Actor[Kamruk - Salvage Model]</li></ul><h1>OTHER SHIPS</h1><hr /><ul><li>@Actor[Corsair Ship]</li><li>@Actor[Destroyer]</li><li>@Actor[Fighter]</li><li>@Actor[Shuttle]</li><li>@Actor[Space Scooter]</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"_id":"VCJ7F19gXZ458LCB","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265519,"modifiedTime":1680784899629,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"nRFV3m3MEAgKsrne","sort":0,"_id":"1R4KW8raQDtt0yDv"}

The exact nature of the darkness is something the preachers and prophets disagree on – some describe it as a dark, corrupting force, the root of all evil, while others, such as the Church of the Icons, believe that the darkness is a mirror image of the shadows and secrets of the human soul. The only thing that is certain is that the emptiness of space seems to be the place where the human psyche is most at risk.</p><p>The endless void, emptiness and loneliness affect the minds of all spacefarers. The darkness exists not only in space, but also in terrifying events, madness and mental trauma. If you have gazed into the darkness, you will never be the same. Regardless of the specific circumstances, mental strain from space travel or traumatizing events generates Darkness Points. The GM receives DP whenever one of the below events happens:</p><ul><li>The PCs perform a portal jump without being in stasis: 3 DP.</li><li>A PC suffers bad stasis after a portal jump: 1 DP.</li><li>A PC prays to the Icons for a reroll: 1 DP.</li><li>A PC activates a mystic power: a varying amount of DP.</li><li>The PCs travel far out into the Big Black: 1-3 DP.</li><li>The PCs visit places or experiences events that are linked to the Dark between the Stars: a varying amount of DP.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SPACE TRAVEL AND DARKNESS POINTS</h5><p>When the PCs leave the safety and comfort of Coriolis or other civilized planets to go traveling in the depths of space, they are exposed to the Dark between the Stars.

As the GM you should make sure to spend your DP, not just pool them. The DP represent that every positive force has a negative counterforce. The different ways you can spend your DP require a varying number of points and are described below:</p><div class=\"blueheader\">USING DARKNESS POINTS</div><ul><li><strong>REROLL</strong>. Just like the PCs can pray to the Icons to get a reroll, the GM can reroll a skill test for an NPC. Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>TAKE THE INITIATIVE</strong>. An NPC breaks the turn order in combat and acts before her turn. The GM decides when. Costs 1-3 DP.</li><li><strong>EMPTY CLIP</strong>. A PC attacking with RANGED COMBAT runs out of ammo. The attack is not affected but the weapon needs reloading. Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>WEAPON JAM</strong>. A PC’s firearm jams as it fires. The attack is cancelled and a TECHNOLOGY roll (a slow action) is required to fix the weapon. Costs 3 DP.</li><li><strong>BROKEN SYSTEM</strong>. A system onboard stops working. It could be anything from a weapon system to life support. A TECHNOLOGY or DATA DJINN roll is required to repair it. Costs 3 DP, or 1 DP if the system in question was poorly tended to.</li><li><strong>SHIP PROBLEM</strong>. The ship’s problem is activated. Details are specified in the list of problems. Costs 2 DP.</li><li><strong>OVERLOAD</strong>. A system is overloaded, either from neglected upkeep or a temporary malfunction. The system stops working for three turns (see Chapter 7). Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>REACTION</strong>. NPCs cannot perform reactions in combat (page 84 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) unless the GM spends 1 DP.</li><li><strong>LOST POSSESSION</strong>. A PC has dropped an important possession. The GM decides which. Costs 3 DP.</li><li><strong>REINFORCEMENTS</strong>. The enemy receives unexpected backup. The GM decides the details. Costs 1-3 DP, depending on the reinforcements.</li><li><strong>INNOCENT IN DANGER</strong>. An innocent bystander is suddenly caught in the line of fire and needs help. Will the PCs intervene? Costs 2 DP.</li><li><strong>PERSONAL PROBLEM</strong>. A PC’s personal problem (page 26 @JournalEntry[The Player Character]) affects her in a manner the GM chooses. Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>NATURE’S WRATH</strong>. Something dangerous in the environment around the PCs suddenly affects them. It could be collapsing beams or a landslide. Costs 1-3 DP depending on the level of danger.</li><li><strong>A DARK MIND</strong>. A PC is suddenly stricken with a temporary dark mania. More details in Chapter 14. Costs 1-3 DP.</li><li><strong>THE POWER OF THE DARKNESS</strong>. Certain talents or abilities can be activated in NPCs or creatures using DP. More details in Chapter 14. The DP cost varies.</li><li><strong>RELOADING</strong>. Normally, NPCs cannot reload their weapons, for example after automatic fire. To do it, the GM must spend 1 DP.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NATURE’S WRATH</h5><p>Nature’s Wrath means that the environment suddenly works against the PCs. It could be smoke, strong winds, mud, falling rocks or something else. Sometimes, nature will affect the PCs negatively without the Darkness having anything to do with it, such as difficult terrain or storms. The nature’s wrath rules below only apply when the GM spends DP to challenge the PCs. There are three levels of nature’s wrath. The effect generally lasts for a limited time, affecting one or more PCs that perform similar actions.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 15.2 Nature’s Wrath</h4><table><thead><tr><th>DP COST</th><th>EFFECT</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The difficulty is raised by 1 for one or more skills.

So, before resorting to violence, always ask yourself: is it worth it?</h3><h4>TURNS AND INITIATIVE</h4><p>Combat begins when you attack an enemy, or when an enemy attacks you. Begin by determining your initiative score. Roll for initiative before testing any skills.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE ICON CARD DECK</h5><p>Instead of rolling dice, you can choose to draw Icon cards from the Icon Card Deck (sold separately) to determine the turn order. The “tens” number on the cards will determine your initiative scores. The “ones” number will break ties. Keep the cards in front of you to remember your scores.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INITIATIVE SCORE</h5><p>All participants in a fight, willing or unwilling, roll one die each. The result of each die is the initiative score for that person. Leave the dice showing your individual scores on the table during the fight. The GM rolls for NPCs. The scores of the combatants establish the turn order, where a higher score goes before a lower one. In case of a tie, let chance decide (roll another die, no modifiers). When all participants in the fights have acted, the turn is over and another begins. Initiative rolls are only made for the first turn of combat; you keep your original initiative roll for the whole fight, but it can be raised or lowered during the fight</p><p><strong>Time</strong>: One turn of combat in the game is approximately 10–20 seconds long.</p><p><strong>NPC groups</strong>: For groups of NPCs sharing the same game stats, the GM can choose to make a single initiative roll for them all. They all act at the same point in the overall turn order, but the order in which the NPCs act at that point is up to the GM.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Sabah attacks a Sogoi warrior deep in the jungles of Kua. She rolls an initiative score of 6, and then adds +1 (i.e. the initiative bonus of her Dura knife). Her total initiative score is 7, and she gets to act first in the turn. She must attack with the Dura knife this turn, because she claimed the initiative bonus from it.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RAISING YOUR INITIATIVE</h5><p>You never reroll your initiative score during a fight, but you can raise your score in a number of ways.</p><ul><li>A surprise attack (below) gives you a +2 to your initiative score, but only in the first turn of the fight.</li><li>The talent Combat Veteran (page 72 @Item[Combat Veteran]) lets you make your initiative roll with two dice instead of one, and you choose the best result.</li><li>You can use actions (below) to maneuver into a better position, raising your initiative score. Your new score takes effect in the following turn, and could change the turn order for the rest of the fight.</li><li>Skill tests that you pass remarkably well can raise your initiative score.</li><li>Weapons can give you an initiative bonus, but only a temporary one. To gain the bonus, you must attack with the weapon in question. If you apply a weapon’s initiative bonus to your score in a turn, you are required to attack with that weapon in that turn – or perform no action at all.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LOWERING YOUR INITIATIVE</h5><p>When it’s your turn to act in the turn order, you can – instead of taking any action – lower your initiative score to any number below your current score. This has the effect of allowing you to simply wait and see how things unfold. When your new score is up, you can choose if you wish to act or to keep waiting, lowering your score further. Your new score is then in effect for the rest of the fight; you cannot “return” to your original, higher initiative score.</p><p>Some bonus effects for successful attacks allow you to lower an enemy’s initiative score.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch5/odacon_vapensystem.webp\" /></div><h4>ACTIONS</h4><p>When it’s your turn to act, you can perform actions. There are four kinds of actions: slow, normal, fast, and free.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACTION POINTS</h5><p>You get 3 Action Points (AP) to spend each turn.</p><p>A slow action will cost you all 3 AP, a normal action will cost 2 AP, a fast action will cost 1 AP, and free actions are just that: free, costing zero AP.</p><p>In a turn, you can perform three fast actions, one normal and one fast action, or one slow action. You can make any number of free actions. Usually, you will perform all your actions together during your position in the turn order, but reactions are exceptions to this (see below). Your AP are refreshed at the beginning of every turn, before anyone acts.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">SLOW ACTIONS (3 AP)</div><ul><li>Firing an aimed shot</li><li>Firing full auto</li><li>Administering first aid</li><li>Tinkering with a gadget</li><li>Activating a mystical power</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">NORMAL ACTIONS (2 AP)</div><ul><li>Attacking in close combat</li><li>Firing a normal shot</li><li>Reloading a weapon</li><li>Ramming with a vehicle</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">FAST ACTIONS (1 AP)</div><ul><li>Sprinting a short distance (typically ten meters)</li><li>Taking cover</li><li>Hitting the ground (makes you harder to hit, see page 88 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat])</li><li>Getting up off the ground</li><li>Drawing a weapon</li><li>Picking up an item</li><li>Parrying in close combat</li><li>Making an attack of opportunity in close combat</li><li>Making a quick shot</li><li>Going into overwatch</li><li>Getting into a vehicle</li><li>Starting a vehicle</li><li>Driving a vehicle</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">FREE ACTIONS (0 AP)</div><p>A free action is really no action at all. Most are passive dice rolls.</p><ul><li>Using your armor against an attack</li><li>Defending in an opposed roll</li><li>A quick shout to a comrade</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 5.1 Action Points</h4><table><thead><tr><th>ACTION</th><th>ACTION POINTS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Slow</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Normal</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Fast</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Free</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  REACTIONS</h5><p>Generally, all your actions must be made at your initiative score’s place in the turn order, but there are exceptions to this. These exceptions are called ”reactions.” There are three different reactions in the game:</p><ul><li>Defending in close combat</li><li>Attacks of opportunity</li><li>Overwatch fire</li></ul><p>How these reactions work are described below under Close Combat and Ranged Combat, respectively.</p><p>In order to perform a reaction, you still need to spend AP. If you perform reactions before your turn in the turn order, you will have less AP to spend on your regular actions when it is your turn. Further, to perform reactions after your turn in the turn order, you need to have saved some AP while performing your regular actions, and so have some AP left over for this turn.</p><p>NPCs cannot perform reactions, unless the GM spends Darkness Points (page 56 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HELPING OTHERS</h5><p>Helping someone perform a slow action counts as a slow action for you as well. Helping someone with a normal or fast action counts as a normal action for you.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>GROUP ROLLS FOR NPCs</h5><p>Groups of NPCs working together can attack with only one dice roll, instead of each one making an individual attack. This works like Help From Others (page 58 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]): each additional person, up to the maximum of three, means a +1 to the attack roll. This makes the GM’s job a lot easier.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Sabah has been broken, and her friend Wali attempts to administer first aid using his M-Dose. He is not a very good medicurg (medicurgy 2), so he asks the help of Cillah (medicurgy 2). When Wali tests his medicurgy, he gets a +1 for Cillah’s help, and a +1 for the M-Dose. The effort counts as slow actions for both Wali and Cillah.</em></p></div><h4>RANGE</h4><p>In combat, the distance between you and your enemy is divided into four categories.</p><ul><li><strong>Close Range</strong>: up to about 2 meters</li><li><strong>Short Range</strong>: up to about 20 meters</li><li><strong>Long Range</strong>: up to about 100 meters</li><li><strong>Extreme Range</strong>: up to about one kilometer</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>BATTLEMAPS</h4><p>A battle map of a desert and a battle map of a bazaar are available as PDFs from the Modiphius website. Use these if you want to keep extra-detailed track of where all the combatants in a fight are positioned. Place tokens or miniatures representing each of the fighters on the white dots on the map. The white dots are two meters apart – that is, at Close Range from each other. Two people cannot occupy the same dot.</p></div><h4>MOVEMENT</h4><p>Moving around in combat requires actions. One fast action lets you move a number of meters equal to your Movement Rate, which typically means ten meters. There are talents that increase your Movement Rate, and non-human creatures and vehicles can both have higher Movement Rates than a human PC. During combat, you will need to keep track of where the different combatants are positioned. You can keep this approximate, or you can use a battle map if you wish. The GM has the final say if there are any uncertainties.</p><p><strong>Terrain</strong>: In difficult terrain like dense jungle, deep snow, or waist-high water, your Movement Rate is halved.</p><p><strong>Crawling</strong>: If you crawl on the ground instead of running, your Movement Rate is halved.</p><p><strong>Sneaking</strong>: Sneaking takes time; if you sneak, your Movement Rate is halved.</p><p><strong>Darkness</strong>: If you are moving in complete darkness, you must move carefully, so your Movement Rate is halved.</p><h4>SNEAK ATTACKS AND AMBUSHES</h4><p>The key to winning a fight is often to attack when the enemy least expects it. There are several ways to do this.</p><p><strong>Surprise</strong>: If you attack in a way that the GM deems surprising to your enemy, you get a +2 to your initiative score. This can only occur in the first turn of the fight.</p><p><strong>Sneak attack</strong>: Sneaking up on someone and attacking without them knowing is called a sneak attack. First, test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong>. Roll only once, regardless of how far you are sneaking. Your roll will be modified depending on how close you want to get to your target (see table 5.2). If you want to attack in close combat, you have to get within Close Range.</p><p>If you fail the test, you are spotted; now roll initiative scores as you would normally. If you pass the <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> test, you get a normal action “for free” before rolling initiative.</p><p>You cannot “trade” your bonus normal action for two fast actions. If several people wish to make a joint sneak attack, they must test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> individually. If one or more of the rolls fail, all the attackers are discovered; now roll initiative scores normally.</p><p><strong>Ambush</strong>: An ambush is a special kind of sneak attack. You lie in wait for an enemy and then attack when she passes you. All participants in the ambush must test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> individually, as above, but each roll gets a +2 modifier because it is the target that is moving, not the attacker.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 5.2 SNEAK ATTACKS AND AMBUSHES</h4><table><thead><tr><th>RANGE</th><th>MODIFIER</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Close</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Short</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Long</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme</td><td>+4</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>MELEE COMBAT</h4><p>When you are within Close Range of an enemy who is aware of your presence, you are engaged in close combat. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t attacked each other yet; as soon as you are within Close Range, you are engaged in close combat.</p><p>When engaged in close combat, you can attack. This is typically a normal action, and you test the skill <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong>. The enemy then chooses if she should take the blow or attempt to defend, which she can do if she has enough AP left. For NPCs to defend, the GM also needs to spend 1 DP (below).</p><p><strong>Standing up</strong>: To attack someone in melee combat, you must be on your feet. If you are prone, you must first stand up (a fast action) before you can attack.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong> can give you extra dice to roll. The weapon’s Gear Bonus tells you how many extra dice you get</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch5/stridshopp_strid_talang.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  BONUS EFFECTS</h5><p>When your melee combat roll is successful, your attack hits and you inflict your weapon’s Weapon Damage on your enemy (see below). For each additional six rolled beyond the first one, you can choose one of the following bonus effects:</p><ul><li><strong>Increase Damage</strong>: You inflict 1 extra point of damage. This effect can be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Critical Injury</strong>: You inflict a critical injury on your enemy. This effect costs extra sixes (beyond the first one) equal to your weapon’s Crit Rating. By adding even more sixes, you can increase the severity of the critical injury.</li><li><strong>Strike Fear</strong>: You strike fear into your enemy. She takes 1 point of stress (page 92 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). This effect can be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Raise Initiative</strong>: You assume a better position for your next attack. Your initiative score is raised by 2, taking effect at the beginning of the next turn. This effect can be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Disarm</strong>: Your enemy drops her weapon, or some other hand-held item of your choosing. Picking something up again is a fast action.</li><li><strong>Grapple</strong>: You pin your enemy in a tight clinch. See Grappling, below.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>Sabah attacks a Sogoi warrior with her Dura knife, and she rolls two sixes. She inflicts 2 points of damage on the Sogoi with the first six (2 is her Weapon Damage), and she spends her second six on pinning the now-bleeding warrior. The Sogoi attempts to break the clinch through an opposed melee combat roll, but fails. In the following turn, Sabah makes a grapple attack, giving her a +2 modifier and a total of 8 dice to roll. She gets three sixes! The pinned Sogoi cannot defend. Sabah spends both her additional sixes on extra damage, and the Sogoi goes limp beneath her, broken after another 3 points of damage.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DEFENDING</h5><p>Your enemy can attempt to defend against your attack, and you can of course do the same if you are attacked. You must state that you intend to defend before the enemy makes her attack roll.</p><p>Defending is a fast reaction (above). This means that you can defend even when it is not your turn in the turn order, so long as you have the AP required. Enemies can only defend if the GM also spends 1 DP.</p><p>When you defend, you test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong>. You and the enemy roll dice at the same time, and compare the results. For each six you, the defender, rolled, choose an effect below.</p><ul><li><strong>Decrease Damage</strong>: You neutralize one of the enemy’s sixes. If she is left at no sixes, the attack misses. This effect can be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Counterattack</strong>: You perform a counterattack, dealing Weapon Damage to the attacker. You cannot spend additional sixes to increase the damage of your counterattack. You can, however, spend extra sixes to inflict a critical injury, but the Crit rating of your weapon is considered 1 step higher than normal. You can spend further extra sixes to  increase the severity of the critical injury.</li><li><strong>Disarm</strong>: You disarm your enemy, but only after her attack has been resolved normally.</li><li><strong>Raise Initiative</strong>: Your initiative score is raised by 2, taking effect this turn if you have not yet acted. Otherwise, the effect applies at the beginning of the next turn. This effect can be chosen multiple times, for additional effect.<br />Note that you can perform a counterattack instead of stopping your enemy’s attack. The outcome could be that you both hit each other at the same time. Also note that each time you defend is considered as a fast reaction, costing you 1 AP. To be able to defend, you must have either not yet acted in the turn, or have AP saved up after performing your regular actions this turn. If you are attacked multiple times in the same turn, you will eventually not be able to defend.</li></ul><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: If your enemy attacks you with a weapon, and you yourself are unarmed, you get a -2 modifier to defending.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> QUICK MELEE ATTACK</h5><p>You can perform a quick attack in melee combat. This is at the expense of accuracy; you get a -2 modifier to the attack roll, but the attack counts as a fast action (1 AP) instead of a normal one (2 AP). Quick melee attacks can only be performed with light weapons (or unarmed).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY</h5><p>If an enemy who is engaged in melee combat with you attempts to move away, you can, if you wish, make an attack of opportunity against her. This works like any other melee combat attack, but counts as fast (1 AP), and you get a +2 to your roll. Attacks of opportunity are reactions (see above).</p><p><strong>Movement</strong>: You also get to make an attack of opportunity against an enemy who moves past you within Close Range. The enemy’s movement must not start or end within Close Range of you – if she passes close enough during her movement, you get to strike.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GRAPPLING</h5><p>As a bonus effect to a successful <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> attack, you can choose to pin your opponent. To break free, your enemy must beat you in an opposed <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> roll. The opposed roll counts as a normal action for the person in the clinch, but as a free action for you. Until your enemy manages to break free, she can perform no other actions.</p><p><strong>Grapple Attack</strong>: While you are grappling with a pinned opponent, grapple attacks are your only available actions. A grapple attack is like any other melee combat attack (a normal action), but with the following exceptions:</p><ul><li>You cannot use weapons (you inflict your unarmed Weapon Damage, normally 1).</li><li>You get a +2 modifier to the number of dice you roll for the grapple.</li><li>Your enemy cannot not defend against the attack.</li></ul><h4>RANGED COMBAT</h4><p>When attacking an enemy from a distance, test the <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> skill. You will need some form of ranged weapon, be it just a rock. The tables in Chapter 6 list the maximum range of different weapons – i.e. how far away your target can be for your weapon to still be used effectively. You can fire your weapon at targets at up to one range step beyond the weapon’s maximum range, but you will suffer a -3 modifier.</p><p><strong>Cover</strong>: You cannot defend against ranged attacks. Instead, a smart move is to find cover (page 93 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) when the bullets start flying.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch5/färdighet_strid.webp\" /></div><br /><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 5.3 RANGED ATTACKS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>DISTANCE</th><th>MODIFIER</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Close</td><td>-3/3</td></tr><tr><td>Short</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Long</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Beyond Weapon Range</td><td>-3</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Target Size</h5><p>If your target is prone or small, you suffer a -1 modifier to the shot. Tiny targets can give even bigger penalties. A large target, such as a vehicle, instead gives you a +1. Huge targets can give you +2 or more – this is up to the GM.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RANGE MODIFIERS</h5><p>The distance to your target will also affect your hit chance.</p><ul><li>When your target is at <strong>Long Range</strong> from you, you get a -1.</li><li>At <strong>Extreme Range</strong>, you get a -2.</li><li>Within <strong>Close Range</strong>, you either get a -3 if you are engaged in close combat with the target (the scuffle makes aiming very difficult), or a +3 if the target is immobile or unaware of you.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AIMED SHOT</h5><p>If you take your time to aim carefully before squeezing the trigger, you get a +2 to your attack roll. This makes your attack a slow action (costing 3 AP) instead of a normal action (2 AP). You cannot make an aimed shot against an enemy with whom you are engaged in close combat – there is simply no time to aim.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> QUICK SHOT</h5><p>If there is no time for aiming, you can just shoot from the hip. You get a -2 to your attack roll, but the attack is a fast action (1 AP) instead of a normal action (2 AP). There are two special rules that apply to quick shots.</p><ul><li>You can only fire a quick shot attack against enemies at Close Range or Short Range.</li><li>If you make three quick shots in the same turn, your clip is empty or your cell depleted. You must reload your weapon.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RELOADING</h5><p>Most firearms have large enough magazines for you not to need to worry about counting shots during a fight – just reload when the fight is over. There are a few exceptions.</p><ul><li>Some primitive firearms like long rifles, bows, and rocket launchers (see the weapon lists in Chapter 6) require reloading after every shot.</li><li>If you make three quick shots in the same turn, your clip is empty or your cell depleted (this does not apply for mounted weapons).</li><li>When you shoot full auto fire (see below), you run a great risk of emptying your clip.</li></ul><p>Reloading in combat is a normal action (unless you have the Rapid Reload talent).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BONUS EFFECTS</h5><p>When your <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> roll is successful, your attack hits and you inflict your weapon’s Weapon Damage on your enemy. For each additional six after the first one, choose one of the bonus effects below.</p><ul><li><strong>Increase Damage</strong>: You inflict 1 extra point of damage. This effect can be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Critical Injury</strong>: You inflict a critical injury on your enemy. This effect costs extra sixes (beyond the first one) equal to your weapon’s Crit Rating. By adding even more sixes, you can increase the severity of the critical injury.</li><li><strong>Suppressive Fire</strong>: You force your enemy to keep her head down. She suffers 1 point of stress (page 92 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). If you are shooting full auto fire, she takes 1 additional point of stress. This effect can be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Raise Initiative</strong>: You assume a better position for your next attack. Your initiative score is raised by 2, taking effect at the beginning of the next turn. This effect can be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Disarm</strong>: Your enemy drops her weapon, or some other hand-held item of your choosing. Picking something up again is a fast action</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>In the Kuan Conglomerate, Sabah is suddenly attacked by a group of mercenaries firing at her from a rooftop. She returns fire with her Vulcan carbine and rolls 7 dice (3 for Agility, 3 for ranged combat, and 1 for the Gear Bonus of the weapon). She rolls two sixes, inflicting her weapon’s Weapon Damage (3) on one of the mercenaries. She uses her second six to disarm the mercenary, whose rifle drops to the street below.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AUTOMATIC FIRE</h5><p>Some firearms are capable of unleashing deadly bursts of fully automatic fire (see the weapon lists in Chapter 6). Full auto fire differs from regular ranged attacks in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Your attack counts as slow (3 AP).</li><li>Your target must be within Long Range or less.</li><li>You get a -2 modifier to your attack roll.</li><li>Regardless of whether your initial roll is successful or not, you can choose to keep rolling dice, one at a time. These extra dice are added to your first roll. However, as soon as you roll a 1, your clip is empty and you must reload (see above).</li></ul><p><strong>Mounted Weapons</strong>: Many large mounted weapons have magazines so big that they don’t need to be reloaded in combat. Full auto fire with these weapons works the same as with other weapons, but a result of 1 on the extra automatic fire dice instead means that the shooter loses control over the weapon and must stop firing. No reloading is necessary.</p><p><strong>Multiple Targets</strong>: When you fire full auto, you can choose to distribute your dice – those in your original roll and/or the extra full auto dice – against new targets. You can do this after rolling. The first six you roll for a new target means that you inflict Weapon Damage on it. Additional sixes against the new target mean bonus effects as usual. Every new target you direct your fire against must be within Close Range of the previous target. You can fire at any number of targets, until the burst is cut off by you rolling a 1.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>Sabah is taking cover behind a wall when suddenly the mercenaries’ firing stops. War-crying, four of them come running towards Sabah’s hiding place, giving her no choice but to fire a deadly burst of full auto fire against them. She rolls 6 dice (3 for Agility, 3 for ranged combat, 1 for the weapon’s Gear Bonus, 1 for the support of leaning against the wall, and then -2 dice for firing full auto). She is out of luck – no sixes! She sends a quick prayer to the Icons, giving the GM a Darkness Point, and rerolls. Two sixes! She uses the two sixes to hit two of her enemies, and then starts rolling extra full auto dice. On the first one, she rolls a 4 – no hit, but she gets to keep on firing because it wasn’t a 1. Next die shows another 4, but she keeps going. Third die shows a 6, which she uses to score a hit on a third mercenary. The fourth die shows a 1 – her clip is empty and she must reload. Three of the mercenaries were hit by Sabah’s burst, each taking Weapon Damage. Time to see if their armor holds!</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> OVERWATCH FIRE</h5><p>As a fast action (1 AP), you can assume an overwatch position, aiming in a specified direction. Your aim covers a 90-degree fire arc with your line of sight in the middle. You cannot assume an overwatch position when engaged in melee combat.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: Overwatch means that you are ready to fire your weapon in the direction of your aim any time during the coming turn (i.e. from now until your initiative score comes round again in the next turn). During this time, you can fire a normal shot (costing 2 AP) whenever you want to, before any other actions are performed – even after they have been declared.</p><p>For example, if an enemy within your fire arc wants to shoot at you, you can shoot him first. Your enemy cannot change her declared action after your overwatch attack. If you and an enemy both are in overwatch position and are in each other’s fire arc, an opposed ranged combat roll (a free action for both of you) decides who goes first.</p><p><strong>Broken Overwatch</strong>: As soon as you perform any action other than shooting at a target in your fire arc, your concentration breaks and your overwatch position is gone. This also immediately happens if:</p><ul><li>You become engaged in close combat.</li><li>You take damage.</li></ul><h4>WEAPONS</h4><p>Weapons make you more effective in close combat, and they are a direct necessity for ranged combat. Chapter 6 lists and describes common weapons in the Third Horizon.</p><p><strong>Bonus</strong> tells you what Gear Bonus modifier you get to your attack roll (i.e. to the number of dice you can roll for your attack). It can be positive or negative.</p><p><strong>Initiative</strong> on a weapon modifies your initiative score – on the condition that you attack with the weapon in the turn. If you apply the weapon’s initiative modifier to your initiative score, you must make an attack with the weapon during the turn. Other actions that somehow include the weapon in question don’t count: to get the weapon’s initiative modifier, you must attack with the weapon, or you lose all AP for the turn.</p><p><strong>Weapon Damage</strong> determines how many points of damage are inflicted on your enemy if your attack hits. Extra sixes on your attack roll can inflict more damage.</p><p><strong>Crit</strong> tells you how many extra sixes beyond the first one you need on your roll to inflict a critical injury on your opponent.</p><p><strong>Range</strong> is the maximum range within which the weapon can be used effectively.</p><p><strong>Light Weapons</strong> require only half a row in the gear list on your character sheet.</p><p><strong>Heavy Weapons</strong> require two rows in your gear list.</p><p><strong>Automatic Weapons</strong> can fire in fully automatic mode.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> means special features and modifications, which are found on some weapons.</p><h4>STRESS</h4><p>You start the game with a pool of Mind Points (MP) equal to your Wits plus your Empathy. When you are attacked in combat or when someone tries to use <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong> on you, you might suffer stress (which lowers your number of MP) from the mental strain. Contact with the Dark between the Stars can also have this effect.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BREAKDOWN</h5><p>If something puts you at zero Mind Points, you suffer a breakdown, collapsing from fear or anxiety. You can follow simple commands but not take any action that requires dice rolls. After D6 hours, you regain some control of yourself and 1 MP is restored; after that, you can begin to recover the rest of your MP normally.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>: You can use either <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> or <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">medicurgy</strong> to treat someone who has suffered a breakdown. If your roll is successful, the person you are calming down regains MP equal to the number of sixes on your roll. Each attempt is a slow action, and each person can try only once.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RECOVERY</h5><p>You automatically recover 1 MP per hour when resting. If you have suffered a breakdown, however (zero MP), you run a risk of permanent trauma. Roll one die. If the result is a one, your maximum total of Mind Points is permanently reduced by one. If you drop permanently to a zero MP total, you become a raving lunatic – time to create a new PC</p><h4>DAMAGE</h4><p>You run the risk of being injured in combat. Everything from exhaustion to bleeding cuts and broken bones is summarized as damage. How much damage you can take is determined by your number of Hit Points (HP).</p><p><strong>Starting Hit Points</strong>: You start the game with a number of HP equal to your Strength plus your Agility scores. Talents can modify your HP total.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch5/strid.webp\" /></div><br /><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TRACK YOUR DAMAGE</h4><p>When your PC takes damage, tick the corresponding number of boxes next to the Hit Points section on the character sheet</p></div><p></p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARMOR</h5><p>To protect yourself from harm, you can wear armor (see Chapter 6). The effectiveness of a piece of armor is described by its Armor Rating. You can only wear one suit of armor at a time. When you take damage from an attack, roll a number of dice equal to your Armor Rating. Each six you roll lowers the damage by 1. The armor roll is a free action. If the damage from the attack is reduced to 0, you escape any critical injuries as well.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>A mercenary is firing a Vulcan carbine (Weapon Damage 3) at Sabah. The mercenary rolls three sixes and uses them all in order to maximize damage. Luckily, Sabah is wearing an armored suit (Armor Rating 3). She rolls 3 dice and gets two sixes, canceling 2 points of damage from the attack.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> COVER</h5><p>In a firefight, taking cover behind something could save your life. Choose something sturdy, like a metal doorframe or a brick wall. Taking cover is a fast action, separate from any movement required to reach the cover itself. Covers also have Armor Ratings and work just like armor (above), but they only work against ranged attacks. Cover and armor can be combined. Simply add the dice together.</p><p><strong>Fire Support</strong>: If you are behind cover, you can also lean on it when shooting. This gives a +1 modifier, but not on quick shots.</p><p><strong>Being Prone</strong>: If you are prone, enemies firing at you suffer a -1 modifier. This can be combined with the effect of cover (above). Also, you can claim the +1 fire support bonus when prone, even if you have no cover.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 5.4 COMMON COVERS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>COVER</th><th>ARMOR RATING</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Divan</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Table</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Door</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Inner wall</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Outer wall</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Brick wall</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Foxhole</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>Sabah is sneaking through a corridor on a spaceship when a corsair suddenly fires at her. The first shot misses, and Sabah takes cover around a corner in the corridor (fast action) to return fire. In the next turn, the corsair shoots again, hitting Sabah with two sixes. Given Sabah is in cover behind the corner (an inner wall) she gets to roll 8 dice when testing her armor (5 for the inner wall and 3 for her armored suit).</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BROKEN</h5><p>If you drop to zero Hit Points, you are “broken” – unconscious or paralyzed with pain, and in no condition to keep fighting. You cannot perform any actions and may not test any skills. All you can do is writhe in pain and cry for help. Further normal attacks that would put you below zero HP have no effect, but you can still suffer additional critical injuries.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>BROKEN NPCS</h4><p>NPCs can get broken, just like PCs. An NPC can give first aid to a PC, and vice versa. When NPCs are treating each other, no dice roll is necessary; the GM can decide the outcome.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GETTING BACK UP</h5><p>Being broken is not fatal; only critical injuries can actually kill you. There are two ways to get back up after being broken</p><p><strong>First Aid</strong>: Someone can help you back onto your feet by administering first aid to you. This is a slow action demanding a medicurgy test of the helping player. The medical equipment at hand determines what modifiers apply to the dice the player rolls (see below). Without any medical equipment, the test cannot be attempted at all – you need to at least improvise something. If the roll is successful (i.e. if the player rolls at least one six), you get back up immediately, regaining HP equal to the number of sixes on the medicurgy roll. Administering first aid to someone who isn’t broken has no effect – no HP are restored.</p><p><strong>Pushing on</strong>: When you have been broken and no one is around to treat you, you automatically recover 1 HP after D6 hours, and can then get back up on your own.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RECOVERY</h5><p>When you are no longer broken, you recover 1 HP per hour until you are fully healed. Critical injuries can still affect you after all your HP are restored, however.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 5.5 MEDICAL EQUIPMENT</h4><p>There are many kinds of medical equipment in the Third Horizon.

Critical injuries represent a much more dangerous form of injury – these can maim or kill you.</p><p>When attacking an enemy, in melee combat or from afar, you can spend any extra sixes you rolled beyond the first one to inflict critical injuries. How many sixes you need (beyond the first one) depends on the weapon you are using. You must spend sixes equal to your weapon’s Crit value.</p><p>When you inflict a critical injury on an enemy, roll D66 on @RollTable[Table 5.6 Critical Injuries] to see which critical injury you inflict. Note that a critical injury won’t necessarily cause someone to be broken.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 5.6 CRITICAL INJURIES</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 5.6 Critical Injuries]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D66</th><th>INJURY</th><th>FATAL</th><th>TIME LIMIT</th><th>EFFECT</th><th>HEAL TIME</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>11</td><td>Wind Knocked Out</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Disorientated</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Sprained Wrist</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Drops held item, then -1 to RANGED COMBAT and MELEE COMBAT.</td><td>D6</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Sprained Ankle</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Falls down, then -1 to DEXTERITY and INFILTRATION.</td><td>D6</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Concussion</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -1 to all advanced skills.</td><td>D6</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Bruised Lower Leg</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Falls down, then -1 to DEXTERITY and INFILTRATION.</td><td>2D6</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Broken Nose</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -2 to MANIPULATION.</td><td>D6</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Broken Fingers</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Drops held item, then -2 to RANGED COMBAT and MELEE COMBAT.</td><td>2D6</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Broken Toes</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -2 to DEXTERITY and INFILTRATION.</td><td>2D6</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Teeth Knocked Out</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -2 to MANIPULATION.</td><td>2D6</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Groin Hit</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for two turns, then 1 point of damage per FORCE, DEXTERITY, and MELEE COMBAT test.</td><td>2D6</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Dislocated Shoulder</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -3 to FORCE and MELEE COMBAT.</td><td>D6</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Broken Ribs</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -2 to DEXTERITY and MELEE COMBAT.</td><td>2D6</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Broken Arm</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -3 to RANGED COMBAT and MELEE COMBAT.</td><td>3D6</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Broken Leg</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Falls down, then Movement Rate halved, and -2 to DEXTERITY and INFILTRATION.</td><td>3D6</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>Shredded Ear</td><td>No</td><td>-</td><td>Stunned for one turn, then -2 to OBSERVATION.

The medicurg Vasil (Wits 4, medicurgy 2) first manages to stabilize her wounds. Then he rolls again to shorten Sabah’s healing time. He gets a +3 modifier for the medlab, rolls his nine dice, and succeeds. The recovery time for the punctured lung, 2D6 days, is halved.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SEVERITY</h5><p>If you have even more sixes to spend than those which you need to score a critical injury, you can use them to increase the severity of the injury. For every extra six spent to increase the severity of the critical injury, you get to reroll the D66 crit roll once. You need to determine how many sixes you want to spend on this before you start rerolling. You are allowed to go back to an earlier result if you reroll.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EFFECTS OF CRITICAL INJURIES</h5><p>Most critical injuries have two effects – one immediate (such as making you fall over or being stunned), and one long term (usually giving you negative modifiers to one or more skills).</p><p><strong>Stunned</strong>: The effect “stunned for one turn” means that you lose all your remaining AP in the current turn (if you have any left), or in the next turn (if you have none left this turn).</p><p><strong>Modifier to Skill</strong>: The listed modifier is in effect until the critical injury is completely healed (see below).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DEATH</h5><p>If you suffer a critical injury described as fatal in Table 5.6, someone must give you first aid or you will die when the listed time runs out. First aid is a slow action and requires a successful <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">medicurgy</strong> test, modified by the available medical equipment (Table 5.5).</p><p>Note that some critical injuries are so severe that a negative modifier is applied to the medicurgy test. As long as you are not broken (above), you can try to give yourself first aid, but you get a -2 modifier to the roll. Each person who attempts to treat you can try only once – to get a second chance, better medical equipment is needed.</p><p><strong>Broken</strong>: If you are both broken and have sustained a fatal critical injury, two separate medicurgy rolls are needed: one to get you back on your feet, and another one to save your life. You can make these two rolls in whichever order you prefer.</p><p><strong>Instant kill</strong>: There are two critical injuries in the table – numbers 65 and 66 – that simply kill you outright. If you roll one of these two, the Lady of Tears has come to claim you. Time to make a new PC!</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HEALING</h5><p>Each critical injury below lists its healing time in days (usually rolled with a number of D6). If someone gives you medical treatment during your recovery time, that person tests <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">medicurgy</strong>, modified by the available medical equipment (see above). If the roll is successful (i.e. if the roll includes at least one six), the remaining recovery time is reduced by half. Earlier <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">medicurgy</strong> rolls to stabilize a fatal injury or to bring you back on your feet from having been broken don’t count – a new roll is required to shorten the recovery time.</p><h4>ATYPICAL DAMAGE</h4><p>There are many ways to get hurt in the Third Horizon. Some examples of “atypical damage” are described below. As a rule, atypical damage is determined through a dice roll where each six means you take 1 point of damage.</p><p><strong>Atypical Weapon Damage</strong>: Atypical damage usually has a Weapon Damage of 1 – the first rolled six causes 1 point of damage – but in some cases the Weapon Damage can be 2 or more.</p><p><strong>Critical injuries</strong>: Atypical damage can result in critical injuries as well, but only if the attack leaves you broken. If you drop to zero HP and there are extra sixes left unused, check the Crit Rating of the atypical damage in question (below). If enough sixes are left, you suffer a critical injury. A critical injury from atypical damage is usually not rolled on Table 5.6; instead, atypical damage has a special critical injury at the bottom of the table. The time limit until death varies, depending on the type of damage.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FALLING</h5><p>A fall of three meters or more ending on a hard surface prompts an atypical damage attack roll. The GM rolls dice equal to the number of meters fallen -2. Armor may be tested. The Crit Rating of falling is 3. Roll critical injuries normally.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DROWNING</h5><p>Swimming on the surface works just like movement on land, but your Movement Rate is halved. If, however, you are underwater (by choice or not), you are “attacked” once every turn. The GM rolls the attack at your turn in the turn order, and before you get to act. He rolls a number of dice equal to double the number of turns you have been under water: two dice for the first turn, four dice for the second turn, and so on. As soon as you come up for air, the attacks stop. Armor has no effect. You will continue being attacked even after having been broken, which sooner or later will result in a critical injury. The Crit Rating of drowning is 2, and the time limit to death is D6 minutes.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FIRE</h5><p>If you are in, or within Close Range of, a large fire, you will suffer attack rolls once every turn. The GM rolls the attack at your turn in the turn order, and before you get to act. The size of the fire determines the number of dice on the roll, and that is up to the GM to decide. The number of dice is then increased by one per turn. As soon as you suffer 1 or more points of damage from the fire, your clothes catch fire, and you will continue to suffer the attack rolls even if you get out of the fire itself. Putting out burning clothes demands a successful <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong> test (you or someone else within Close Range of you may attempt the roll). Armor may be tested. You will continue being attacked by fire rolls even after having been broken, which sooner or later will result in a critical injury. The Crit Rating of fire is 1, and the time limit to death is D6 turns.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EXPLOSIONS</h5><p>The strength of an explosion is measured in its Blast Power. When an explosive detonates, the GM rolls an attack with a number of dice equal to the Blast Power once for each person within Close Range of the explosion. Armor may be tested. The Crit Rating of normal explosions is 2 (but see Shrapnel, below). Critical injuries caused by explosions are rolled on Table 5.6, like regular critical injuries.</p><p><strong>Blast Radius</strong>: Powerful explosives, with a Blast Power of 7 or higher, may wound people beyond Close Range of the explosion. Within Short Range, the Blast Power is lowered by 6. If a lot of victims are within Short Range of the explosion, the GM could make one attack roll against them all, for simplification.</p><p><strong>Shrapnel</strong>: The Crit Rating of normal explosions is 2, but bombs containing shrapnel such as nails or ball bearings, as well as some forms of grenades, are more lethal. Explosives that spread shrapnel damage have a Weapon Damage of 2 and a Crit Rating of 1.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HUNGER AND THIRST</h5><p>Coriolis is not mainly a game about survival, but you could well end up in situations where you don’t have enough food or water. The GM decides when this is the case.</p><p><strong>Thirst</strong>: If you lack sufficient water, you become dehydrated. You automatically suffer 1 point of damage per 12 hours (no attack roll is made). When dehydrated, you cannot heal any damage or critical injury. If you become broken from thirst, you immediately suffer a critical injury. The time limit to death is D6 days.</p><p><strong>Hunger</strong>: If you lack sufficient food, you will starve. You automatically suffer 1 point of damage every 48 hours. In all other regards, see Thirst, above.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> COLD</h5><p>If you are in a cold environment without the necessary gear to stay warm (the GM decides), you suffer attack rolls with six dice – the frequency of those rolls is up to the GM. Around zero degrees Celsius, a roll per day should be enough, but on a blistering ice planet, you may have to roll once per hour. The Crit Rating of cold is 1, and the time limit to death is D6 hours.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> VACUUM</h5><p>The Dark between the Stars is a cold and unforgiving place. Without the protection of an exo shell or the hull of a ship, you won’t last long in the black void. If your ship suffers explosive decompression or if you are thrown out of an airlock, your life is in extreme danger. The absence of pressure creates gas bubbles in your blood, causing your whole body to swell up. This results in crippling pain, all while the raw UV radiation from the nearest star sears your skin. You can’t hold your breath – if you do, your lungs will collapse – so after about ten seconds you lose consciousness from the lack of oxygen. After that, you are maybe a minute or two away from death.</p><p>Rules-wise, you must pass a <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong> test every turn you are without protection in a vacuum. The test is a free action, but you must pass it before doing anything else in the turn. The roll is unmodified for the first turn, but you get a -1 modifier for the second turn; in turn three you get -2, and so on. A failed roll means you drop directly to zero HP, become broken and suffer an immediate critical injury. The time limit to death is D6 minutes.</p><p>Before going unconscious, you should put all your efforts towards getting an exo shell on, if one can be found nearby. Climbing into an exo shell in a single turn requires a successful <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong> test.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RADIATION</h5><p>The Dark between the Stars contains many places where you will be exposed to hard radiation – on a spacewalk near a dying star, for example, or when you try to repair your ship’s leaking reactor core.</p><p><strong>Radiation Level</strong>: When you are exposed to radiation, you suffer Radiation Points (RP) that accumulate in your body. Check off the RP boxes on your character sheet. The area’s Radiation Level determines how often you get RP.</p><ul><li><strong>Weak Radiation</strong>: 1 RP per day</li><li><strong>Strong Radiation</strong>: 1 RP per hour</li><li><strong>Extreme Radiation</strong>: 1 RP per minute</li></ul><p><strong>Effects</strong>: Every time you suffer an RP, you must roll a number of dice equal to your total current number of accumulated RP. For every six in the roll, you take 1 point of damage. The Crit Rating of radiation is 1, and the time limit to death is D6 days.</p><p><strong>Recovery</strong>: When you leave the irradiated area, you heal one RP per day.</p><p><strong>Permanent Radiation</strong>: There is a risk that the radiation will permanently stay in your body. Every time you are about to heal an RP, roll a die. If it shows a six, the RP is not healed but instead becomes permanent. Mark this with a line between the RP boxes on your character sheet. Permanent radiation can never be healed.</p><h4>VEHICLES</h4><p>The Third Horizon is home to many different kinds of vehicles. Driving under normal circumstances requires no dice rolls, but more advanced maneuvers demand pilot tests. Note that pilot is an advanced skill; unless you have a skill level of at least 1 in pilot, you don’t get to roll for it and fail the test automatically. Entering or mounting a vehicle is a fast action. Starting a motorized vehicle is also a fast action.</p><p><strong>Gear Bonus</strong>: The modifier you get to your PILOT tests when performing challenging maneuvers. Small, agile vehicles generally have higher bonuses than large and heavy ones.</p><p><strong>Hit Points (HP)</strong>: How much damage the vehicle can take before becoming wrecked.</p><p><strong>Movement Rate</strong>: The speed of the vehicle – how many meters the vehicle moves per fast action from the driver.</p><p><strong>Fuel</strong>: All vehicles require fuel, be it fusion batteries or bahtrol. Table 5.7 lists which vehicle needs which fuel type.</p><p><strong>Passengers</strong>: The number of people that can ride in the vehicle, including the driver.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: The Armor Rating of the vehicle.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch5/algol_stid.webp\" /></div><br /><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>VEHICLES IN THE THIRD HORIZON</h4><p>Planetside vehicles in the Third Horizon normally run on wheels or graviton projectors. The former types of vehicle are commonly referred to as “crawlers” and the latter types as “gravs.” Most vehicles are powered by small fusion units that run on water, or sometimes they run on rarer isotopes of water. Smaller vehicles may run on fusion batteries or cells. Older, more primitive, vehicles sometimes run on alcohol, or on petroleum products like bahtrol.</p></div><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 5.7 VEHICLES</h4><table><thead><tr><th>NAME</th><th>BONUS</th><th>HP</th><th>MOVEMENT RATE</th><th>ARMOR</th><th>PASSENGERS</th><th>FUEL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Armored gravcraft</td><td>0</td><td>40</td><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>Fusion unit</td></tr><tr><td>Gravcraft</td><td>+1</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>Fusion unit</td></tr><tr><td>Grav Bike</td><td>+2</td><td>8</td><td>30</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>Fusion battery</td></tr><tr><td>Crawler</td><td>0</td><td>25</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>6–8</td><td>Fusion unit/bahtrol</td></tr><tr><td>Band Loader</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>Fusion unit</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> VEHICLES IN COMBAT</h5><p>Combat in a vehicle works just like combat on foot, but you use the vehicle’s Movement Rate instead of your own.</p><p><strong>Ramming Enemies</strong>: Most vehicles can be used as weapons – i.e. to simply ram your enemies. It counts as a <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> attack, but you test pilot instead of melee combat. Don’t forget the vehicle’s Gear Bonus. The Weapon Damage is equal to the vehicle’s HP divided by five, rounded up.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>Sabah is riding her grav bike through the Conglomerate slums. She wants to ram a mercenary from Short Range. She uses a fast action to get within Close Range (the bike’s Movement Rate is 30 meters), and then her normal action to ram the enemy. She rolls 7 dice (Agility 3, pilot 2, Gear Bonus +2). After a quick prayer, she finally gets two sixes. The mercenary is hit and takes 3 points of damage (Weapon Damage 2 – the bike’s HP (8) divided by 5 and rounded up, +1 damage for the extra six).</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DAMAGE TO VEHICLES</h5><p>Vehicles suffer damage just like people, each point of damage lowering the vehicle’s total Hit Points by 1. When the vehicle’s HP drop to zero, the vehicle is wrecked. Vehicles don’t suffer critical injuries. Most vehicles have armor, which works just like armor does for people.</p><p><strong>Ramming Vehicles</strong>: You can use your vehicle to ram other vehicles as long as your vehicle has at least as many HP (starting value) as the enemy’s vehicle. Roll the attack like you would if you were ramming a person. The damage from your attack is inflicted on the enemy vehicle. Passengers in the vehicle are only hurt if the enemy vehicle’s HP drops to 0, in which case all passengers suffer the same amount of damage as the vehicle did.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>An enforcer from the Syndicate fires a missile against Sabah’s gravcraft. The attack hits and deals 6 points of damage. Sabah tests the gravcraft’s armor (Armor Rating 3), and rolls one six. The gravcraft takes 5 points of damage.</em></p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"lm08GqSM28fSq5pk","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265335,"modifiedTime":1680592717679,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"TFn3Ex1LfhYhAv3s","sort":0,"_id":"2x5TrLkB00YF1occ"}

Trade and new Zenithian ways have replaced armed conflict and isolationism. Ancient traditions have been abandoned, which upset some of the factions. Luckily, the Council of Factions seemed to live up to its civilized reputation, and careful negotiations resolved issues that in the past would have resulted in bloodshed. And then, the Emissaries arrived. It started with reports of faint sensor echoes from the depths of the gas giant Xene, and then they emerged – ghosts from another world. They arrived at the Foundation’s research installation monitoring the gas giant, numbering five, and on an unknown mission. One of them remained at the station, three set off into the Horizon and the last one headed straight for Coriolis to demand a seat on the Council.</p><h4>THE BIRTH OF THE MYSTICS</h4><p>When the Emissaries arrived, so did something else – ordinary people suddenly began changing. Minds twisting, rampant madness, but worst of al – mystical powers, thought only to exist among the ascetics of the Circle of Seekers, were suddenly manifesting themselves at random. From prince to beggar, Firstcome to Zenithian – anyone could suddenly fall victim to the illness, known as Mystic’s disease, or simply the Blight. The medicurgs of the Foundation compete with the Order’s prophets to try and explain the phenomena as either a mind meme or an evil curse from beyond the darkness. People with mystical powers are being hunted and killed – even just suspicions of the illness are enough to place someone in mortal danger. Mystics who wish to live stay silent and disappear while fear and hate has the Horizon in a stranglehold.</p><h4>THE ZALOSIAN CONFLICT</h4><p>When the Emissary on the Foundation station at Xene declared itself the Judge incarnate – an Icon – the Firstcome factions were outraged by the blatant heresy. The Order of the Pariah threatened to leave the Council, but was persuaded to stay. Instead, the Order closed their home system and stopped all traffic through the Zalos system, effectively shutting down the pilgrims' route to Mira. This also threatened the trade flow vital to the Consortium, which has responded by posing an ultimatum – reopen the routes or the Legion will be sent in to deal with the situation. The Order says that they will keep the system closed until the blasphemous emissary is extradited to Zalos to stand trial. The other factions watch and wait, the Council does nothing. A secret arms race begins. Docks on Kua and Sadaal increase their production. The Consortium sends spies and agents all across the Horizon for information. Zalos remains silent.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch8/kua_jagare2.webp\" /></div><br /><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><em>Monastery Cruiser Hamijara of the Order of the Pariah.</em></div><p></p><h4>THE TAOAN DISTRESS CALL</h4><p>Suddenly, something happened. A distorted distress signal arrived from one of the Colonial Agency’s largest settlements, Tsubari on Taoan – a desperate cry for help. Only a fragment of the whole message had gotten through, but it spoke of an attack. The Zenithian factions convened and assembled a rescue mission. The fleet departed for Taoan only to face death and destruction – just a handful of ships returned. Silence descends upon the Horizon yet again, but something stirs beneath the surface.

Read or act out the following:</p><p><em>Echoes from the past, voices speaking about the important task ahead. Captain Ia Kaschares: “The Tsurabi colony has sent us a distress call and we are part of the response team. What we expect to find after the jump to Taoan is not clear – well, you’ve all heard the message. We are being escorted by a Legion destroyer, the Zafirah, and we make the jump immediately after her.”</em></p><p><em>Colonial agent Nakifa continues: “The Tsurabi colony is a gas mine orbiting the system’s largest planet, the gas giant Taoan. About three hundred colonists, mainly miners plus a few scientists. Since we’re going in blind, no orders have been issued. Sensor sweeps will tell us more when we get there.”</em></p><p><em>The captain again: “All non-essential personnel are to go on ice immediately and sleep their way to Hamura. The Icons are with us – the Deckhand smiles in the bed next to you and the Traveler keeps watch from the bridge as we jump. See you in Taoan. Sleep tight.”</em></p><p><em>The urgency of the present: Flashing red and white lights, blaring sirens, heavy heads and unresponsive limbs. You must have come out of stasis too soon, and this is the infamous thawing nausea. Infamous for good reason.</em></p><p><em>No orders, no updates – just the cold floor underneath your feet and bodies reluctant to move. Your fingers remember the code to the locker with your personal effects and you clumsily put your gear on – no weapons, of course, those are kept up on the bridge.</em></p><p><em>You look around at each other – all frozen and stiff, squinting in the faint light. Still no orders, no updates – nothing. Stasis beds stacked in rows around you. About thirty team members went to sleep here – why are you the only ones awake? One of you asks for more light in a hoarse voice, but nothing happens. You call out to the central computer, but get no answer. You look at each other, at the spiral staircase climbing upward into the dark, and at the flashing white pulses in the red light strips along the floor.</em></p><p><em>Emergency lighting.<br />Emergency.</em></p><p>The PCs wake up surrounded by humming stasis pods, with heavy heads from the cryo sleep.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs and two dozen other rescue workers went on ice in a section containing sixty beds divided between four chambers. The PCs are in the deepest chamber, which has saved their lives – the sleepers in the chambers above are all dead (from the radiation). Many of the deceased clutch Icon talismans – a deckhand tradition when going on ice. Show the PCs the picture of the Ghazali, and show them which section of the ship they are in. Apart from a vague memory of where their ship is docked, they know nothing else of the ship. They will have to start exploring the ship to find their bearings.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>WEAPONS</h5><p>The PCs were not supposed to bring weapons onboard, and any they brought along anyway were locked away on the bridge. They might have been able to hide a weapon on their person, however. If they pass an INFILTRATION test, they have managed to stash a weapon, so long as it has the weapon features Light or Small.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>FINDING WEAPONS</h4><p>If the PC didn’t smuggle weapons onboard (see above), they might want to get hold of something to defend themselves with as they leave the stasis chamber. A successful FORCE test allows them to rip a steel pipe from the wall to use as a club (Gear Bonus +1, INIT 0, weapon damage 1, CRIT 3, Close range). Clever PCs might try to find a power tool instead, by searching the crates of mining gear (dura drill, thermal lance or equivalent – Gear Bonus 0, INIT 0, weapon damage 2, CRIT 2, Close range).</p></div><h4>THE STASIS CHAMBER</h4><p>The chamber is faintly illuminated by the red emergency lighting, but brighter light shines in from above where a spiral staircase leads up to more chambers. The room is a simple construction of metal and rubber, without any of the upper decks’ luxurious fittings. At the top of the stairs, after passing four identical chambers, an automatic door opens and closes on a dark corridor. The PCs’ personal effects can be found in the lockers at the foot of the stasis beds. All weapons they brought aboard are kept on the bridge, however.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>Passing a medicurgy test can reveal that the other rescue workers in this section have been killed by radiation poisoning. The PCs must exit the stasis chambers to find out more about what has happened. Attempts to contact the ship’s computer via the intercom system fail. A successful data djinn test can tell them that they must find a working terminal to contact the ship’s intelligence. All the terminals they pass seem to be broken, however.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Oyq3luWJhCS9gB55","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252629,"modifiedTime":1680376252629,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"1fwOiyHqfa7kK99F","sort":0,"_id":"3Bk00cvhdfWfNuGe"}

As the inhabitants of the station find out more about their new guests, however, they become the talk of the town.</h3><p><strong>The PCs are</strong> approached by the colonial agent and the local Bulletin correspondent, and are invited to a meeting with the station Akbar. Below is a list of events for the epilogue. As they wait for clearance to jump back to Kua, a lot can happen – read more on page 52 @JournalEntry[The Hamura System].</p><h4>ARRIVAL AT HAMURABI</h4><p>The PCs’ ship arrives at the Hamurabi portal station. Three smaller vessels are docked already, but no ships appear to be in jump preparation. The dock’s manager replies straight away to their docking request and sends them a vector for Dock 11. If the PCs radio ahead to tell the port office about the fate of the Ghazali and about carrying badly irradiated passengers, they are promised that a medical team will be waiting at the docks when they land.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/epilogue/Hamurabistationen03_fri.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WELCOMING COMMITTEE</h5><p>Port inspector Asal Harub – ever the bureaucrat – and two station guards are the first to greet the PCs as they dock. Asal has not been informed about the circumstances of their arrival regardless of whether they alerted the port office or not, and obnoxiously starts flicking through documents on his tabula to have them fill out all the correct paperwork before entering the station interior. The inspector’s annoying adherence to protocol might land him in trouble as the survivors are likely to be desperate for medical attention, but a team from the station’s medlab rushes in before things get out of hand and starts helping the wounded off the ship. Asal is shoved aside, loudly complaining about the triumph of anarchy over order – in his mind, the fact that no one informed him of the medical needs of the new arrivals trumps the fact that an enormous catastrophe has just occurred, practically in his own backyard. He demands to inspect every inch of the PCs’ ship to restore some of his sullied professional honor. Should he find Sabetha Pour’s cargo during his inspection, the PCs are in big trouble…</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MEDLAB</h5><p>Chief medicurg Lumara Akbion and her team follows the Life-Limb-Function-Aesthetics rule, initially focusing on saving as many lives as possible. Replacing lost limbs with prosthetics and other minor surgeries will have to wait.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STATION MANAGEMENT AND THE EMERALD DISC</h5><p>The PCs are called upon by station chief Rhavinn Bokor. He is interested in anything they can tell him about the Ghazali disaster, and will accept the emerald disc if they offer it to him. He can’t read it however, only the Colonial Agency can do that. The dynamic decryption on the disc is outside of his abilities to crack, even if he was allowed to try. If the PCs wish to hold on to the disc themselves, Rhavinn recommends that they bring it to the Agency headquarters on Coriolis as soon as possible, which is what he himself will do if it is entrusted to him.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE COLONIAL AGENCY</h5><p>Shortly after their arrival on the station, the PCs are approached by Colonial Agent Yasintra Hur. She is also interested in their statement regarding the incident. She has a more direct, demanding demeanor than Akbar Bokor, and will insist that they hand over the emerald disc if she finds out that they have it. She intends to be the one to hand over the disc to her superiors to score political favors, and is willing to do a lot of things to see it through. If she finds the PCs uncooperative, she threatens to slander their involvement in the evacuation – which she could quite easily do, as she is friends with Anata Garam and several others at the Bulletin.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BULLETIN</h5><p>The Bulletin is represented on the station by Anata Garam. She is very keen on interviewing the PCs, and would love to shoot a segment onboard the ship. Unless the PCs hide from her, she makes sure their faces and names are on every screen on Hamurabi and Coriolis over the next few days. Anata will try to dig up as much as possible about the PCs and their handling of the evacuation. If they acted foolishly or immorally during some situations on the Ghazali, she will most likely find out about it. If you want to put your players on the spot even more, she might even be able to find dirt on them from previous scenarios. The way they are portrayed in the Bulletin could heavily affect their Reputation scores (page 28 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[The Player Character]).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>OTHER NEWS</h4><ul><li>The portal between the Hamura and Taoan systems was damaged during the incident and the Foundation have no prognosis about when (or even if) it will recover. This means that Dabaran is currently only reachable via Amedo and Melik. The Zafirah had completed the jump to Taoan when the portal exploded, and its fate remains unknown. Rumors about the Legion destroyer are not optimistic, and Legionnaires and their families are gathering at the chapels on the station to pray.</li><li>The Council of Factions have convened an emergency meeting, but the resulting actions are surprisingly weak. A small reconnaissance group is sent the long way around to investigate but it will take long time before any news is heard back from them.</li><li>After another week or so, reports arrive indicating that the portal between Uharu and Taoan fluctuates in a strange new pattern, effectively isolating the Taoan colony from the rest of the Horizon. The Legion and the Consortium rapidly try to fortify their hold on the Hamura portals, causing tension with both the Hegemony and the Order. The Order’s temple cruisers show up in Uharu and quickly disperse the small fleet of mercenary gunboats hired by the Consortium. Political tensions near a breaking point.</li><li>In the absence of news about the Taoan colony, the Bulletin returns to focusing its coverage on the second hottest topic: the conflict between the Consortium and the Order over passage through Zalos, closed by the Order after the heretical claims to divinity made by the Judge Emissary.</li></ul></div><h4>THE RETURN TO CORIOLIS</h4><p>The most likely course of action for the PCs at the end of the scenario is to jump back to Coriolis, which is an uneventful affair. Rhavinn Bokor provides jump coordinates free of charge if the PCs promise to deliver the news of Hamurabi’s dire medical shortages to the owners on Coriolis. The free space on the PCs’ ship will be hotly contested by the rest of the survivors, as they too wish to return to Coriolis. Economically minded PCs stand to make a quick fortune off of the competing passengers. Rhavinn Bokor tries to persuade the group to bring some of the worst cases with them as they have a better chance of surviving if they receive proper medical attention on Coriolis.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> IN THE SPOTLIGHT</h5><p>PCs who willingly submit to the massive media exposure that follows the disaster are invited to Dawn Hostess Nana Eliades’ talk show, recorded every morning at the Alkamaar restaurant at the top of the Spire on Coriolis. The interviewees are treated to all the luxuries of the famed establishment, including courtesans and specially imported delicacies. The show is seen by a fifth of the station’s population, and PCs who appear on the show become instantly recognizable in the streets, at least until the next big event comes along. If they go on the show, the PCs’ Reputation scores are raised or lowered by 1, depending on how their actions during the evacuation are portrayed. Most other news circulating on the station also concerns the Ghazali disaster.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE EMERALD DISC</h5><p>If the PCs retrieved the emerald disc, the time has come to pass it on to someone else. The group may have their reasons for wanting to deliver it to a factionary hotshot, but it isn’t important who ends up with the disc, at least not for this scenario. The disc is encrypted with the Colonial Agency’s dynamic cipher – a code constantly producing enormous amounts of new information, making it incredibly difficult and time-consuming to crack it without the key. If another faction initially gets hold of the disc, they will eventually sell it back to the Agency for promised support in future votes on the Council. If the PCs attempt to sell it to the Agency themselves, they will be offered the non-negotiable sum of 5,000 birr. If they hesitate, the agent they are meeting with will firmly say that this is the faction’s only and final offer – one they would be very wise to accept. If they refuse, the faction will turn to Special Branch (see page 190 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[The Consortium]), and highly trained agents will start stalking the PCs, ready to do whatever it takes to get the disc back. The emerald disc contains the following information, some of which may come into play later during the Mercy of the Icons campaign, and some that you as the GM can use to create your own scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>The Portal Field</strong>: The Ghazali was hit by an energy pulse from the portal field when the Zafirah jumped. Detailed logs show that the blast occurred before the entire destroyer was through, which may indicate that parts of the Zafirah may still be in the Hamura system. A partially corrupted spectrum analysis of the portal field shows that the blast significantly altered the fluctuation patterns of the portal, on a scale previously unheard of.</li><li><strong>The Probes</strong>: The warning from the Zafirah came from three emergency probes fired from the aft of the ship before it was all the way through the portal. The destroyer suffered such catastrophic damage immediately upon entering the field that the emergency protocols were activated.</li><li><strong>The Zafirah’s Data Dump</strong>: A data dump of the Zafirah’s condition was included with the message on the probes. It is the hardest information to get out of the disc, and only available to the PCs through contacts within the Agency or the Legion. The logs show that the Zafirah suffered multiple hull breaches immediately upon entering the portal field. This took the grav projectors offline and damaged several critical systems, and the ensuing collapse of the portal field tore the ship in half. This resulted in a reactor overload only seconds later and decompression in several sections. The most mysterious piece of information in the logs is that the destroyer evidently suffered damage before the portal field blast. If this is shared with the Agency, they will begin investigating the incident as a terrorist attack, with the Order of the Pariah as their prime suspects.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FATIMA’S BOUNTY</h5><p>The owner of Fatima’s Bounty, aging skipper Ninia Skados, perished along with the Ghazali. Her sickly widower, Radavan Skados, thus inherited the ship but has no interest in becoming a free trader – he is perfectly content with his life at a Legion Veterans’ home where he spends his days playing shah and bragging about his heroism on Uharu. To afford continuing his lifestyle (previously paid for by his wife), he might be inclined to let the PCs have the Bounty (“She would have wanted youngsters like you to have it”) in exchange for a contractual obligation to pay Radavan’s modest living expenses (To make it simple, this sum has been included in the Bounty’s service costs below). The contract is to be signed with Legion lawyers present as witnesses, and the faction will make sure the PCs hold up their end of the deal. If the PCs attempt to claim the ship as theirs without contacting the authorities, they will soon run into trouble. The ship is registered to Ninia Skados, which will show as soon as someone scans their transponder signal.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>STATS FOR FATIMA’S BOUNTY</h4><p>Fatima’s Bounty is a medium freighter of the Omrik model.</p><table><thead><tr><th>STATS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Energy Points: 5</td></tr><tr><td>Hull Points: 6</td></tr><tr><td>MANEUVERABILITY: –1</td></tr><tr><td>SIGNATURE: 0</td></tr><tr><td>ARMOR: 5</td></tr><tr><td>SPEED: 2</td></tr><tr><td>MODULES: Accelerator Cannon, Docking Module, Hangar, Cabins (Standard), Cabins (Suite), Chapel, Cargo Module X5, Cargo Module X2, Medlab, Countermeasure Dispenser, Escape Pods, Unused Module Space X2, Stasis Module, Workshop</td></tr><tr><td>FEATURES: Atmospheric entry, Robust hull, Bonus modules x2 (for a total of 23 modules)</td></tr><tr><td>EXTRA GEAR: None</td></tr><tr><td>PROBLEM: Curse</td></tr><tr><td>COST: 1,652,500 birr</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/epilogue/frihandlare2.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SABETHA POUR’S SENSITIVE CARGO</h5><p>You are free to let your players explore the mystery surrounding Sabetha Pour’s contraband as you please.

People looking to hire personnel can upload their task or problem to the database, and prospective adventurers can take the job from any of the Bulletin’s info terminals on stations or in ports, or apply through a Free League field office. It is usually the smaller fish who use the database, but it supposedly features a locked area containing faction missions as well, only available to those with the proper code key. The database contains a sophisticated search engine with many helpful features to aid the user. The GM can use the database to offer the group a few different missions to choose from. You can use the mission sheet from the Free League web page to write down the missions available to the PCs. There is also an editable digital version of the mission sheet – use it to share your missions with the Coriolis forum on the Free League website. Expand on the missions below with your own material – every mission can be an exciting adventure!</p><h4>MISSION TYPE</h4><p>The first step is choosing the mission type, or rolling dice on table 18. The outcome will determine difficulty level, travel distance, possible complications and other problems. A mission that will take a long time to accomplish including long travel or containing difficult resistance will of course result in greater reward than a routine mission. Some missions will earn the PCs extra rewards, which could be anything from more birr to new ship modules or favors. There are rewards tables in each of the group concepts' sections and explanations of the different forms of rewards in table 43 on page 50 @JournalEntry[10 - Mission Generator].</p><p>The group’s concept should be the foundation of their missions, but there is nothing stopping a group of free traders from infiltrating a spy ring or a group of agents from working an ice hauler – variety is a spice, even in the Horizon! Below are descriptions of the group concepts' different mission types and what they are called.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AGENTS – MISSIONS</h5><p>Agent groups can take on missions from a range of different employers. The mission itself is often pretty straightforward, but complications along the way could make it more difficult. The locations of the missions are for the GM to decide, or he can use the systems table at the end of this chapter. The kind of location is determined randomly, however. The rewards are often birr or gear, but could include other things as well.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  MERCENARIES – CONTRACTS</h5><p>The life of a mercenary is tough and brutal, and so are their contracts. The employer is often a larger organization, but it could be a small group or business as well. The contracts are often combat-oriented, but the GM could use ingredients from the other group concepts' missions if he wants to. The locations are often war zones, combat stations or fortifications.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EXPLORERS – EXPEDITIONS</h5><p>Finding the birr to fund your own expedition is not easy. This makes most explorers dependent on patrons and sponsors. Since a group of explorers could be anything from correspondents to colonists or archaeologists, the expeditions can vary a great deal. The GM can modify and improvise to tailor the expedition to the group. The rewards are often permits to go on expeditions of one’s own, or new, desirable knowledge.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PILGRIMS – VOYAGES</h5><p>Like explorers, pilgrims are a disparate group. They could be just that – pilgrims – or travelling plebeians, circus troupes, nomads etc. Pilgrim voyages are therefore divided into three categories: one for pilgrims, one for entertainers, and one for plebeians and nomads. The rewards will vary depending on the different groups' needs and lifestyles.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FREE TRADERS – TRADE RUNS</h5><p>Some free traders travel the whole Horizon, others stay in one system, but they all live off commerce.

The Zenithians can shed no light on the matter, but this is of no consequence to the faithful – the fact that the Icons exist is enough. The Icons link everyday life with spirituality in many ways. The figurines on the altars of people’s homes, the talismans on dashboards and bridges, the temples and chapels along the trade routes, in the villages, and on the space stations – all are links between the individual and eternity. The nine Icons are worshipped differently depending on profession, faction and personal beliefs. In some places they are even praised under different names but, according to the Church of Icons, they are still the same Icons. The nine Icons and their followers are presented below.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>DAR SALUB’S GRIEF</h5><p>Legend has it that the sultan Dar Salub on Dabaran sent his son on an important diplomatic mission during the Water Wars, but offered no tribute to the Messenger. The son was supposed to hoist white sails upon his return, but forgot, and was shot down by the sultan’s accelerator batteries. The bereaved ruler ordered the construction of a gigantic sailing palace in which he had himself immured as an offering in the hopes of good fortunes for his son in the afterlife.</p></div><h4>CALENDAR</h4><p>In the Third Horizon and on Coriolis, time is usually measured in cycles – or Coriolis’ Cycles, CCs – instead of years, as the length of a year differs from system to system. One CC is the length of a Kuan year and is divided into three triads of three segments each. Each segment is dedicated to one Icon. There is one odd day between each of the triads. These odd days are special holidays and are celebrated in a fashion reflecting the coming triad’s Icons.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/cyclade.webp\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">The Icons</div><table><thead><tr><th>ICON</th><th>SYMBOL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The Messenger</td><td>Scroll</td></tr><tr><td>The Dancer</td><td>Sweeping Shawl</td></tr><tr><td>The Gambler</td><td>Dice</td></tr><tr><td>The Deckhand</td><td>Key</td></tr><tr><td>The Merchant</td><td>Chalice</td></tr><tr><td>The Judge</td><td>Sword</td></tr><tr><td>The Traveler</td><td>Ship</td></tr><tr><td>The Lady of Tears</td><td>Tear</td></tr><tr><td>The Faceless One</td><td>No symbol</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE AFTERLIFE</h5><p>Philosophers, priests, and prophets everywhere debate the nature of life beyond the corporeal. To common people, the afterlife is a heavenly place, reminiscent of Al-Ardha before it was destroyed by industry and progress. Ascetics in the Circle of Seekers dispute the existence of an afterlife altogether, instead believing that the spirit is reunited with the Icons in the eternal Aoum. The Church of the Icons has no official view on the afterlife, but has denied all claims that the ghost or soul of a deceased can be trapped in the Dark between the Stars and transformed into a dybbuk, a sarcofagoi, or some other mythic creatures.</p></div><h4>THE MESSENGER</h4><p>The fleet-footed Messenger brings news, prayers, and omens to wherever the faithful might be. The Messenger is portrayed as a pale boy with a stern face and flaming eyes. He is sometimes depicted holding a winged messenger rod, and in some places he himself is portrayed with wings, such as in the Hafra chapel on Algol, for example. He is sometimes called the Whisperer, the one who knows all your secrets, or the Seducer who drives people mad. Many view the Messenger as the Icon that escorts your ghost to the afterlife when your body dies, often as a host of sparrows or some other small birds. Sacrifices to the Messenger are often made when a message must be delivered or cargo secured, or together with intercessory prayer to bring someone good luck. A common sacrifice is the burning of a prayer written on a piece of paper or putting a small vessel carved out of sugar in the alcove of the Messenger in the temple. Woe to all who neglect the temperamental Messenger.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/budbäraren.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><h4>THE DANCER</h4><p>The Dancer is the Icon of inspiration and perseverance. Sometimes woman, sometimes man, but most often androgynous and ungendered like the hijras. The Dancer represents the bond formed in the life union between two lovers, but also unbridled lust when appearing as the Musician, playing a nine-string lyre or a cirra. Darker folklore speaks of the Beast, representing mankind’s true nature and, according to some, her inherent evil. The Beast has no place in the temples, but some of Mira’s forest nomads worship it as the Icon of strength and portray it as a dragon-like creature with fur and nine eyes. Sacrifices to the Dancer are a small but exquisite meal, a dance, or a beautiful song, but preferably all three combined.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/dansaren.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><h4>THE GAMBLER</h4><p>For the adventurous, the intelligent, and the gifted, the Gambler is a perfect fit. Curious children who speak the truth as they see it and think quickly on their feet are the Icon’s protégées. The Icon is often pictured as a young man stretching his hand towards you, urging you to take a risk, to roll the dice. Myth and folklore across the Horizon usually describe the Gambler as a trickster, such as in the forms of the Laughing Hyena on Algol, King Macaque on Mira, or as juggling tarrab. The darker aspect of the Icon is surrounded by stories of monsters and the Dark between the Stars. On Mira, one incarnation of the Gambler is the Ensnarer who comes for the cowardly and the weak that are afraid to take risks in life. The Gambler appreciates simple offerings, such as dice, Gambler cards from an Icon deck, a mug of wine or some other kohôl. Lingering memories from the Long Night speak of goat blood sacrifices, and ever fouler things.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/spelaren.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">offerings</div><p>A suitable sacrifice can be just about anything one has at hand – as long as the act of faith itself is pure – but trading in offerings is nevertheless a lucrative business. Outside larger domes, chapels, or temples there is usually a row of traders selling myrrh, tabak, or olibanum incense sticks, tiny sugar sculptures holding bowls of vinegar, bone fragments, dice, cards, decorative rope work, Algolan paper sculptures – basically everything even faintly faith related. The Church of the Icons has not done anything about this yet, but concerns are being raised about the dangers of commercializing the faith, the “Zenithism” of it all.</p><h4>THE DECKHAND</h4><p>The Deckhand is usually portrayed as a tired boy holding a broom or a switch key. The Deckhand can bless homes, ships, and stores, if they’re well-kept and the right offerings have been made. The Deckhand protects the unfortunate as the folklore always depicts the Icon sharing their fate – tricked out of a well-earned reward. Some stories describe the Deckhand a bit differently, as a rascal that disturbs commerce, destroys electronics on ships, or makes sure the shelves in the shops are dusty and crooked. This aspect of the Deckhand is called the Waba, or the Fox. The best sacrifice to the Deckhand is a well-kept shop, balanced accounts, and meticulous service to one’s ship. In the chapels, a common offering is to wash the altar of the Icon and read a fairytale for the tired boy.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/skeppsgasten.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><h4>THE MERCHANT</h4><p>The portly Merchant, an older man dressed in embroidered silk robes, is the Icon of prosperity, forward thinking, and success. The kind and generous side of the Icon is often depicted as an elderly, smiling woman giving alms to the poor. She is revered by colonists who live off the land and plantation owners and farmers who pray for a good harvest. The darker side of the Merchant is the Miser who can be found in caricature form in many plays and holo dramas. The Miser has an insatiable lust for birr, precious stones, and power, and is oblivious to the consequences. Commonly, a sacrifice to the Merchant is birr (although sometimes gold leafed sugar birr) or fancy raw materials, delicacies or cut crystals.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/Krämaren.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><h4>THE JUDGE</h4><p>An old matriarch with a grave face and a sword at her side is the common way to picture the Judge. The Judge’s realm is that of justice and due punishment, hence the name. Early Icon myths name the Icon either as The Blind or the Warden, and many believe that it is the Judge who presides over the afterlife, accompanied by the Gambler and holding a pair of scales. The famous mosaic in the Sarras temple on Menau depicts the Judge together with the hyena-headed Gambler who is trying to lead the ghosts of the dead astray. The Martyr is another aspect of the Judge and the most important Icon to the Order of the Pariah. The Martyr accepts unjust punishments, such as in the story “The Woes of Chigas” where the Martyr takes Chigas’ place when Kahaz, the monster of the deep, is coming to devour her. The only sacrifice the Judge desires is confession of one’s failings and lies, and remorseful penance. Flagellation in honor of the Martyr can be appropriate under certain circumstances, but is almost exclusively practiced by the Order.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/domaren.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><h4>THE TRAVELER</h4><p>For free traders, caravaneers, explorers or colonists, the Traveler stands for protection. The Traveler is often a man with his eyes on the horizon, holding a walking stick, a compass or maybe an astrograph. A Firstcome variation of the Traveler is the Star Singer, who is a spreader of wisdom and who anchors reality with song and story. Yet another aspect is the Demiurge worshipped on Menkar, believed to be the original portal creator. In this origin story, the Portal Builders never existed, but instead it was the Icons themselves who wove the network of gates between the Horizons. The malicious side of the Traveler is the Spider, who controls the web of star ways and traps reckless ship crews in the darkness between the portals. Offerings to the Traveler are usually a knotted hemp rope or crude string,  a figurine of a ship, a dromedon, a horse or some other transportation craft.</p><h4>THE LADY OF TEARS</h4><p>On their way toward the Judge’s justice, the Lady of Tears accompanies the dead. She also consoles the ones still living. The Lady of Tears is a woman dressed in the white of mourning, traces of tears still on her cheeks, but with a mysterious smile. Her element is fire, the cleansing fire that destroys the body to set the spirit free. A dark aspect of the Lady is the Butcher or the Executioner, who cuts or hacks off body parts until nothing is left, but still leaves the ghost trapped. A less grim incarnation is the Lady of Tar, who covers the pyre and the corpse in pitch for a quick and intense fire. The Lady of Tears is praised with offerings of burning myrrh, white candles, or small fires – not inside the chapel, though.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/gråterska.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">MOURNERS AND PYRES</div><p>It is customary in the Horizon to hire mourners for the funerals of loved ones. Preferably, one should endeavor to hire courtesan-trained mourners, with their beautiful white silk dresses, carrying palm leaves and flowers of the light. Mourners are a high status profession and they are believed by many to have a mystical contact with the Icons thanks to the nature of their craft. Iconoscopes written by a mourner always seem to come true. Funeral pyres or cremation is the main form of funeral rite in the Third Horizon. According to Foundation historians, this is probably related to the practical benefits of these methods to life on spaceships or space stations, but the Firstcome scoff at such heathen theories – fire is the only thing that can release the spirit from the body, hence the tradition. Only the most holy of bones are spared from the flames, as this will keep their saintly spirits in the Horizon where they can continue their righteous work. Myths about sarcofagoi who feasts on corpses – or even worse, about bokor or necrographers who reanimate the deceased as their slaves – is likely a part of the explanation as well. Only a few asteroid communities or very remote space stations keep from burning their dead, instead letting the station’s recycling systems take care of the corpses, but this is a custom of bad, almost unholy, repute.</p><h4>THE FACELESS ONE</h4><p>The Seeker among the Icons is never pictured. In temples and on Icon walls there is instead an empty place or alcove, or an asymmetry in the placement of the other Icons. Not so long ago, many did not even know of the existence of the Faceless One, but the rise of the Church of the Icons changed that. On stage, the Faceless One is portrayed as a masked figure all in black that sneaks about the set, rearranging the props and giving or taking away objects from the actors. The most common aspect of the Icon is the Shadow, although for a long time many thought of it as an evil spirit rather than an Icon. The Shadow brings madness by luring the soul out into the Dark between the Stars. The anonymity of the Faceless One makes for few sacrifices in its honor, except by those who have known and revered the Icon for a long time, such as the Black Lotuses of Ahlam’s Temple or the Karvor nomads in Aigi, Uharu. A proper offering is often a mask, black or white stones, or a drop of blood from the believer. Unsubstantiated but persistent rumors claim that certain unsavory cults on Mira and Dabaran worship a perverted aspect of the Faceless One with human sacrifices to quench the Icon’s thirst for souls.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"AJwtj0t9jsAztKEh","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266696,"modifiedTime":1680376266696,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"50J4BLJfueA1P26k"}

Shopkeepers decorate their storefronts, religious processions slowly walk the Ring, crowds gather to pray together at the Core Plaza. Since the disappearances of both the station’s mystics and the Emissary, people are desperately turning to the Icons for guidance. New pilgrims arrive every day and the station is beyond overcrowded. As the cycle nears its end, people fear the dark times ahead. There are still demonstrations almost every day and tensions between different groups onboard have increased even more during the PCs' absence.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> JUDGE KURAHAN TAKES OVER</h5><p>Judge Kurahan will present the PCs' report about the strike team’s base to the Guard, and leak it to the Bulletin. Her motivation is purely to increase her own power within the Consortium’s ranks and her actions have nothing to do with the Hegemony’s conspiracy, but it ties in perfectly with the plans of the hegemonists. Kurahan will also suggest that the PCs continue their hunt by going to Kua, unless they have already decided to do so themselves. Through judicator Akouba, she will stall the official investigation for as long as she can, even withholding the coordinates of the landing site if necessary, to ensure that all credit for finding the Emissary will belong to her alone – there is still time. Depending on how quick the PCs have been to complete the scenario, there may be one or more days left before the Cyclade, and still hope of finding the Emissary.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BREAKING NEWS</h5><p>The Bulletin reports about the events in the Cellar will cause an uproar in the Core and the Sanatorium will be surrounded by an angry mob. The Guard will reluctantly act as human shields to protect the Order’s embassy and the Spire residences of the faction’s ambassador. Rumors will start going around saying that a group of ”external specialists” (the PCs) were hired to deal with the situation, regardless of whether the Guard have stolen the credit for the raid or not.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE OTHER FACTIONS</h5><p>The news that the Order of the Pariah were behind the kidnapping of the Emissary will cause other factions to act:</p><ul><li><strong>The Consortium</strong>: The Consortium’s Special Branch will start looking for the Emissary, first on Coriolis and then down on Kua.</li><li><strong>The Order of the Pariah</strong>: The Order will deny having anything to do with abducting the Emissary, but that is all.

In the ruins left behind by the Portal Builders lived only semi-intelligences, more animal than human. Eventually, the original colonists from the First Horizon arrived through the portals, in self-imposed exile or through forced displacement. They settled on Algol, later spreading to Mira, Zalos, Kua, Sadaal, and Dabaran. Space stations were constructed, grand palaces erected, new colonies founded. The early colonists spread across the Third Horizon like seeds on the wind. They bore many names but most have been forgotten. Today, they are remembered only as the Firstcome.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>language</h4><p>The language of the Zenithians, Zeni, has grown into the lingua franca of the Horizon today, as trade and commerce are dominated by the Zenithians. Most travelers (and PCs) speak Zeni in addition to their native tongues.</p><table><thead><tr><th>LANGUAGE</th><th>SPOKEN WHERE?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zeni</td><td>Coriolis and the entire Horizon</td></tr><tr><td>Dabari</td><td>Dabaran and in many of the systems along the Dabaran circle</td></tr><tr><td>Miri</td><td>Mira and Aiwaz</td></tr><tr><td>Kuan</td><td>Kua and Coriolis</td></tr><tr><td>Algolan</td><td>Algol, Kua, and in many systems along the Algolan route</td></tr><tr><td>Zalosi</td><td>Zalos</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Most Firstcome today live as planet side colonists, plebeians, or slummers, although a sizeable part of the population are space nomads or stationaries, living in fleets and swarms or on lonely space stations.</p></div><h4>THE FIRSTCOME</h4><p>The Firstcome are a diverse group of people that migrated to the Third Horizon in great colonization vessels in many waves, countless years ago. The order of their arrival has been forgotten, but tradition names Algol as the first planet they settled on. Starting out as a rather homogenous group regarding language and culture, they slowly grew apart over the centuries. Today, almost every system has its own language, although migrants and colonists spread the tongues within the Horizon – the Conglomerate on Kua has a large Algolan speaking minority, for example. The Icon faith is the one constant across all the Firstcome peoples, albeit with many different variations in practice. The Firstcome societies tend to be centered on the extended family or the clan, but this is beginning to change.</p><p>For a long time, the Firstcome lived only in the core systems, but when time turned colonists into natives, new waves of pioneers colonized the systems farther out. The war against the First and Second Horizon stopped the spread and laid waste to vast territories however, and the population declined during the Long Night. Today, the Firstcome are expanding again, as a reaction to the arrival of the Zenithians and their trade.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE BERI NOMADS</h5><p>The Beri nomads live in the relatively temperate desert regions of Lubau’s northern hemisphere, riding their dromedons between the oases that surround lake Mnembau. The Beri are suspicious toward new things, and only a few members speak Zeni or own technology more advanced than a long rifle. They lead a good life regardless of this, masters of the desert in black caftans. Outside of Lubau, they are mainly known for their hot chili stew with chicken and eggs.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE PEOPLES of THE RIMWARD REACH</h5><p>The three nomad swarms in the Rimward Reach are a motley group without a clear common agenda. They are basically self-sufficient but trade when they need to, and run some rudimentary mining operations. They control a large number of ships, but are spread across all of the Rimward Reach as the new colonists have outmatched them in forming permanent settlements. “Swarm” is the nomadic term for a group of space ships with a common ancestry. A swarm is normally spread over several AUs. Individual vessels can leave the swarm for short periods of time, but it is rare for a ship to change swarm. The three swarms of today are the warmongering Mehtar, the secretive Badjao, and the Yahin-Kabu, the traders. A fourth swarm, Ahilar, was lost at the beginning of the Marrab conflict, a schism that affected the entire Rimward Reach.</p></div><h4>THE STARFARERS</h4><p>The space nomads travel the Horizon in ancient ships, often heavily modified and jury-rigged, using whatever spare parts their engineers can get hold of. Just like other Firstcome people, the nomads are clan oriented with large families, passing down a profession through generations. From your early years, you will be an apprentice pilot, hydroponic farmer, life support engineer, security guard, or maybe an exo warrior. The clan organizes all of society’s functions.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/nomadsoldat_horisonten.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><p>Since the arrival of the Zenithians, the nomads are increasing in numbers, probably due to the fact that ships are easier to come by and that the best planets are quickly becoming crowded. Many people are faced with the choice of moving away and becoming colonists or making the stars their home, and choose the latter. The nomads fear nothing. They know death is waiting on the other side of the hull and that the smallest mistake could lead them to it. On the other hand, they are freer than any other people – they can go anywhere, jump as they please, and lead adventurous lives. The saying “a drop of nomad’s blood in you” is used to describe wild or impulsive people. Most nomadic groups keep to one route or territory, usually remaining within one system. There are reports indicating that more mystics have appeared among the nomads than elsewhere, something that would support the theory that it is the Dark between the Stars that is the source of “the Blight”.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/prospektor_horisonten.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><h4>THE HUMANITES</h4><p>The humanites are a scorned and despised group. They are modified humans created to perform certain functions or endure certain hardships better than base humans. Even the plebeians, whose work is almost the same as that of the humanites, look down upon them.</p><p>The humanites often live isolated lives, in remote colonies on hostile worlds or distant space stations, like the Sirb for example. Some humanites live as nomads after their employers or masters have disappeared, like the Xinghur on Lubau. Recognizing a humanite without advanced sensors and biometric scanners can be hard. Tiny sculpts like reptilian third eyelids, extremity hearts, or modified glands are invisible to the naked eye, while larger modifications usually are the result of cosmetic sculpting on Coriolis, the independent station Ahalimm or in the Algolan meat district. According to the stories of some of the more primitive peoples, there are humanites that have lost almost all their humanity and have become more like animals. Rumors claim that the nekatra are actually the result of the Legion experimenting with lupine biocode</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>KNOWN HUMANITES IN THE HORIZON</h4><p>Although the Foundation’s biocode census indicates that as much as 10% of the Horizon’s population carries humanite biocode, only a few humanites are publicly known. One known group is the Sirb, usually found on remote space stations or mining vessels. The Sirb have the ability to live as a group without conflicts arising and can emit scent signals that affect feelings and behaviors. The technically skilled Xinghur have an unknown origin, but are in several ways adapted to hot desert climates, and seem to have relatives in the Algolan deserts. The Ichtar, who live on the Kuan north cap, are extremely cold resistant. The Nerids in the oceans of Sadaal can breathe under water and are used by the Iconocracy as workers in the heavy industry located in the planet’s oceans and marshes.</p></div><h4>THE ZENITHIANS</h4><p>The popular saying “Everyone is a Zenithian and everyone is not” describes how many regard the Zenithian people or themselves. No one in the Horizon, with the possible exception of the hemographers in the Hegemony, knows exactly how many Zenithians there actually are. It is however obvious that a lot more people call themselves Zenithians than the Zenith brought with her. Data from the Mathematical Institute in Daddah show that there are more Zenithians in the Horizon than there possibly could be, given the size of the arkship. This is because many call themselves Zenithians without actually being one.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE EXPATRIATES</h5><p>On Amedo, far from the hub of the Horizon, lies the dome city Xhi, home of the expatriates, on the forested slopes of the Alantides. The expatriates are a cult that claims direct descent from the mighty families the Zenithians left behind on al-Ardha, but who later joined the colonists who became the Firstcome. Xhi is sponsored by the Hegemony and has been approved as a true Zenithian colony by the faction. The expatriates follow the Hegemony with slavish discipline, and many lower-ranking Astûrban troopers are recruited from Xhi.</p></div><p>Two generations have passed since the arrival of the Zenith, some 60-odd cycles of marriages and couplings between Firstcome and Zenithians that have created a Horizon far less divided than it appears to be at the Council of Factions.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/Kramare_dublett_horisonten.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><p>The Zenithian Hegemony claims to speak for all Zenithians and offers assistance whenever it is in the faction’s interests, whether the help is appreciated or not. The best-known example of their aid is probably the storming of the Autumn Palace on Dabaran where a Zenithian noble had applied for asylum with the emir. According to the press release to the Bulletin, he had been “brainwashed by anti-Zenithian interests”. During the storming, led by an Astûrban strike team, the emir and all of his family were killed, and the fleeing nobleman was escorted back to the Monolith. Those who call themselves Zenithians feel more modern than the Firstcome, although they are still Icon believers. Zenithians in other systems than Kua are often connected to colonies from Coriolis or Kua, or to a Consortium corporation. Some cities have whole districts populated by Zenithian exiles, such as Little Zenith in Alburz, Sadaal, or the round Par-Corioli block in Tirgonum, Mira. The Zenithians are generally of a more pragmatic nature than the Firstcome, and have replaced family ties with corporations, factions and birr.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/tbana_coriolis.webp\" /></div><hr /><ul><li>@JournalEntry[The Daily Life in the Horizon]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Technology in the Horizon]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Culture in the Third Horizon]</li><li>@JournalEntry[The Nine Icons]</li><li>@JournalEntry[The Church of the Icons]</li><li>@JournalEntry[The Faith of the People]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Spirits and Myths]</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"_id":"EXW8if5xumlBM0kK","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265238,"modifiedTime":1680376265238,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"5VkiKqtb09Bv78s4"}

The Firstcome tend to prefer loose-fitting garments such as djellabas or gallabeyas, while Zenithians prefer shirts such as the kameez or the kurta, as well as vests and veils. Among space station and ships crews, practical clothes with pockets are common, along with tight coats and belts. The fashion changes over time, and different groups are influenced by foreign styles and designs, which makes beautifully embroidered djellabas or gallabeyas common among important Zenithians and wealthy merchants, for example.</p><ul><li><strong>BURRA</strong>: A wide, straight skirt worn over pants by both men and women. Common in dance rituals performed by preachers or ascetics.</li><li><strong>DHOTI</strong>: A piece of fabric worn as a loincloth or strapped on as pants. Common together with a kurta or kameez.</li><li><strong>DJELLABA</strong>: A full-length robe usually made from cotton or wool. Certain local variations include a hood. Belts are sometimes used to accentuate the waist.</li><li><strong>DUPATTA</strong>: Long shawl that can be worn in many different ways, usually tied around the head.</li><li><strong>GALLABEYA</strong>: A wide, full-length robe without collar, and sometimes without buttons. The sleeves are usually very wide and sometimes contain small pockets. Most common in hot climates.</li><li><strong>GUTTRAH</strong>: A smaller piece of cotton fabric worn as a turban-style headdress or fastened with black string, called agal.</li><li><strong>CAFTAN</strong>: A long coat with wide sleeves. Commonly not buttoned in the front but worn open or with the front parts overlapping, sometimes with a belt.</li><li><strong>KAMEEZ</strong>: A long pull-on shirt, usually with embroidery.</li><li><strong>KURTA</strong>: A knee-length, straight shirt or jacket with a round collar.</li><li><strong>THAWB</strong>: A full-length robe with straight sleeves and no collar.

Ordinary computers are harder to command (-1) than Advanced ones (+1). The most difficult machines are the primitive thought machines that must be operated using keyboards and programmed manually in obscure code languages (-3).

It is especially popular in the so-called flying theaters on Mira, acrobatic performances that traditionally used complex systems of ropes, pulleys and wires but that nowadays have moved on to grav belts instead. The scene where the Dancer comes flying across the stage in a red kharonicle with flowing veils in “Jasmine Mourning” has been described as magical by the theater critics, and has given Nestera massive publicity on Mira. Less romantic and artistic areas of use for the belt include morbid obesity, wall climbing or visits to high-G worlds.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/algol_marklastare.webp\" /></div><h4>RECON AND INFILTRATION</h4><ul><li>@Item[Chameleon suit]</li><li>@Item[Fiberscope]</li><li>@Item[Lie detector]</li><li>@Item[Mechanical lockpick]</li><li>@Item[Modulation mask]</li><li>@Item[Proximity sensor]</li><li>@Item[Recon probe]</li><li>@Item[Security tablet]</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/drönare_mina_rymdskepp.webp\" /></div><h4>WEAPON GEAR AND COMBAT</h4><ul><li>@Item[Advanced scope]</li><li>@Item[Command unit]</li><li>@Item[Fusion battery]</li><li>@Item[Night sights]</li><li>@Item[Optical scope]</li><li>@Item[Reload, Advanced]</li><li>@Item[Reload, Ordinary]</li><li>@Item[Reload, Primitive]</li><li>@Item[Reload, Vibro]</li><li>@Item[Sensor scope]</li><li>@Item[Signal jammer]</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/s129.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"1N4pu20RWhhu5TCv","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265844,"modifiedTime":1680592734145,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"kpSTkcIu7eg2RKP9","sort":0,"_id":"5dtGidRhkVDpL0Jx"}

This scene focuses on the trials the group faces in the jungle and is affected by the outcome of the starting scene.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs are stranded in the jungle. They either came in drop pods or tried to land their own ship or shuttle, but were shot down by the Shaukar scouts. They must now make it across the plateau, catch up with the smugglers, and possibly also deal with confused kidnapping victims fresh out of stasis. The events below describe what might happen to the group on their trek. How much time the journey will take depends on their means of transportation:</p><ul><li>Four days on foot</li><li>One day using the jungle crawler (can carry twelve people)</li><li>Six hours by hover scooter (can carry two people per scooter)</li></ul><p>The events below may modify the time table. The time alterations are written for a journey on foot.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The journey will take the PCs to the Baybasin outpost, located where the Verkâna Ridge jungles meet the Ramishah river. The coordinates of Baybasin can be obtained in a number of ways, and they may already have found them in the previous scene, either by interrogating a smuggler taken prisoner or by speaking to the Shaukar scouts.<br />FINDING THE WAY<br />This scene offers a few different ways of finding the outpost:</p><ul><li>Jungle encounters (see Events)</li><li>Tracking the Jackals' vehicles</li><li>Shadowing the smugglers</li><li>Using sensors to track the stasis units</li></ul><h4>VERKÂNA RIDGE</h4><p>Verkâna Ridge is an unforgiving nightmare of dense undergrowth, monsoon rains, wild beasts, and hilly terrain. Crossing the ridge is almost impossible by vehicles other than tiny gravcraft or heavy crawlers. The intense heat means that travellers will have to drink twice as much water as usual. The area is full of scorpions, spiders, and snakes that could put the group in all sorts of dangerous situations. Jungle fever is also a tangible threat. Local insects are very interested in the PCs' supple flesh unless they cover themselves completely – herb salves can be used during the day and mosquito nets in the night.</p><p>Traversing the ridge is a demanding task and the PCs must all test survival during their first day. Those who fail will slow the group down, get stung or bitten by wildlife leading to infection, or fall victim to some bacterial disease (see Fever Dreams below). A critical success by one PC can negate the failure of another. From day two and onward, only one PC needs to test survival. Again, a failed roll will slow them down (see below).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HUNGER AND THIRST</h5><p>Each traveler must consume one ration of food per day and one ration of water every six hours. Lack of food results in a –1 penalty on all physically demanding skill tests. Lack of water means 1 point of damage for every two missed water rations, consecutive or not. This applies to both the PCs and any prisoners they might have brought out of stasis. A traveler who suffers 2 points of damage or more counts as exhausted (see Fever Dreams below). The Shaukar guerillas (and the Sogoi smugglers) have a talent that enables them to find food, water, and shelter in the jungle, which might help the PCs – depending on how they interact with these characters of course.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TRACKING</h5><p>If the PCs are unsure of exactly where the smugglers came from, they can follow the tracks left by the jungle crawler. If they defeated the smugglers and are following the old tracks backward, finding the way requires a successful <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> or <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">survival</strong> test at –2. If they let the smugglers escape, the difficulty is reduced to –1. Have the PCs roll dice once per day – or as often as you like.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PURSUERS</h5><p>The PCs could have let the smugglers go without a fight in the previous scene. If they have remained undetected by the Jackals, the smugglers are less cautious about covering their tracks, giving the PCs a +1 to their tracking rolls.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE</h5><p>A failed tracking or jungle survival roll enables the GM to activate an event of your choice without spending any DP.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>In this scene, the PCs might encounter local jungle dwellers, wild animals, members of the Baybasin militia, and suspicious slavers.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Militia Members]</li><li>@Actor[Slaver Guards]</li><li>@Actor[Jungle Locals]</li><li>@Actor[The Frozen Prisoners]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The events in this scene have to do with different encounters along the PCs' way to Baybasin. None of the events are mandatory and the rules for the trek itself can be found above.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FEVER DREAMS</h5><p>Regardless of whether it is from hunger, thirst, strange bacteria, or insect bites, one traveler suddenly begins to sweat heavily, develops a fever, and becomes lightheaded. She collapses and vomits, expelling what little her stomach still contains (see the Jungle Fever box). This events costs 2 DP for the GM if it affects a PC, but 0 DP if it affects one of the prisoners from the pods.</p><p>Cost: 0, 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WATER BUFFALO</h5><p>A domesticated water buffalo is stuck in a bog. Two young half-Sogoi are desperately trying to free it. If the PCs help them, they share their meager supplies with them (D6 rations each of food and water) and give them directions to Baybasin, which takes one day off of their travel time. The buffalo could, on the other hand, feed the entire party for the whole trek. If they attack and kill the buffalo owners, the GM gets 2 DP. If they only scare them off and then proceed to kill the buffalo, the GM gets 1 DP.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (May generate 1–2 DP)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HARRIERS</h5><p>A group of soldiers from the Baybasin militia have rounded up the inhabitants of a small village and are harassing them to make them give up their valuables. The villagers look malnourished and unable to resist the shakedown, or produce anything worth stealing for that matter. The situation is growing crueler and more grotesque by the minute. The PCs may spot the affair before entering the village, and may also discover a group of teenagers hiding behind one of the houses, preparing to attack the harriers with clubs and an old long rifle. If the PCs help the villagers, they will be eternally grateful and offer them one day’s worth of food and water. If they instead alert the militia to the surprise attack, the soldiers will escort them to Baybasin as thanks. The teenagers will be “brought to justice” and made an example of. Unless their execution is stopped by the PCs, the GM gets 2 DP.</p><p>Cost: 2 DP (May generate 2 DP)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SLAVE COLUMN</h5><p>The PCs encounter a marching column heading for a clearing on the ridge. The majority of the workers are slaves from near and far and are chained together. The overseer is merciless and pushes the group so hard that one of the slaves falls to the ground. The slaver immediately begin beating her and screaming at her. The rest of the column are kept in check by armed guards but the mounting tension threatens to escalate past the breaking point. If the slave on the ground is killed, a handful of the other slaves will attack the five foremen, who will have a clear advantage as they are armed with acc pistols and a Vulcan carbine. None of the groups will attack the PCs unless they choose sides in the conflict. If the PCs allow the slaves to be killed without interfering, the GM gets 2 DP.</p><p>Cost: 2 DP (May generate 2 DP)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> MANEATER!</h5><p>A group of Sogoi from one of the local tribes approach the PCs. They are armed and alert. Their village has suffered from predator attacks for a long time now, and this group has finally decided to move to Baybasin to get away from the monster, even if they run the risk of losing their freedom by doing so. They pray to the Icons that the maneater won’t catch the PCs' scent. They might be willing to team up with the PCs for the remainder of the journey to Baybasin, for protection. If the PCs accept this, they will soon discover that their new companions have trouble keeping up. One day is added to their travel time.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE JUNGLES' WRATH</h5><p>The extreme climate on Verkâna Ridge forces the PCs to use all of their wilderness knowledge in order to survive. Below are some examples of the dangers of the jungle:</p><ul><li><strong>The Monsoon</strong>. A storm comes roaring in from the southern ocean, forcing the PCs to find shelter as fast as they can. The gale drains their energy and falling trees and flash floods could be very dangerous. Depending on how you wish to use the storm, have the PCs test either survival, force, or dexterity.</li></ul><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>JUNGLE FEVER RULES</h4><p>As the GM, you can either treat the jungle fever as a strength 4 poison, or use the following rules: Jungle fever is a strength 4 opposed roll vs one of the victim’s attributes (which attribute depends on the cause of the disease) and affects either HP or MP:</p><ul><li>Insect and snake bites affect Strength and inflict damage.</li><li>Bacteria affects Agility and inflicts damage.</li><li>Lack of food or clean water affects Wits and inflicts stress.</li></ul><p>Failure results in 4 points of damage or stress. The victim also suffers a –1 to the affected attribute until all the damage or stress has been recovered. If the victim is broken by the fever, she immediately suffers a atypical critical injury (see page 95 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]), loses conciousness, and dies after D6 days of burning fever and vomiting. A separate MEDICURGY test is required to treat the fever, in addition to the one required to treat the Broken condition.</p><ul><li>Limited Success means that the victim suffers a –1 to the affected attribute for 4D6 hours, but nothing further.</li><li>Critical Success means that the victim suffers a –1 to the affected attribute for D6 hours, but nothing further</li></ul></div><ul><li><strong>Quicksand</strong>. The PCs enter an area where the sand has become liquefied. The treacherous patches are hard to spot (survival –2). PCs who start to sink must pass a hard (–2) dexterity test to climb out. The test is modified by encumbrance. PCs who pass the test may attempt to help stuck comrades by testing force – for each six rolled, the stuck PC gets a +1 to her test. PCs who fail their initial roll and become stuck will lose pieces of their equipment when trying to climb out. They must give up items equivalent to one or more rows of their gear list to be allowed to roll again, with a +1 to the test to each row sacrificed. Alternatively, they can wait for someone to pull them out, which requires an insane (–3) force test, in which case they will lose only one row worth of items.</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><ul><li><strong>Azaëlean Tunnel</strong>. The jungle boils, trees are uprooted, and the ground disappears beneath the PCs' feet. They must pass a dexterity test or suffer 2 points of damage (may test armor normally). Alternatively, you could subject the PCs to a fall of D6 meters (minimum three meters, see page 97 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). After the quake, an underground tunnel has opened. Courageous PCs may choose to use the tunnel and shorten their journey by one day before the tunnel veers off and forces them back above ground. Read more about the @Actor[Azaëlean] on page 320 of the Coriolis core rulebook.</li></ul><p>Cost: 3 DP (2 if the tunnel can be used by the PCs)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RAMSES' JACKALS</h5><p>If the PCs left the combat from the previous scene unresolved and have faster means of transportation than the Jackals, they can catch up with them and stage an ambush. If the smugglers are traveling on foot, the PCs just need to pass their first day survival test to catch up. If they fail the test, only a fast vehicle will enable them to stage the ambush. If combat breaks out, use the NPC stats from the previous scene.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>ARRIVAL AT BAYBASIN</h4><p><em>Your eyes are blurry from exhaustion. Every step sends jolts of pain through your limbs and your bodies are covered in cuts and insect bites. The humid heat against your skin makes your fingers want to scratch and claw and never stop – you envy the many reptiles you have seen along the way and their ability to shed their skin. The knotty trunks of the large trees that grow on Verkâna Ridge seem to close in around you – a mighty wall of dark green, scarred but not tamed, despite the Conglomerate’s attempts at expansion. You are at the mercy of the Icons, held hostage by a hostile planet.</em><br /> <br /><em>Just as you start to lose all hope of ever finding your goal, you catch a glimpse of the blue sky through the trees. The jungles' suffocating grip wanes and the smell of fire, cooking and human civilization greets you as you near the edge of the forest.

The mystic powers that have begun manifesting in the Third Horizon are a crude, basic form of what the Symmetry refers to as resonance. Unlike the First Horizon’s manipulation of the dark between the stars, the Symmetry mystics prefer to let their minds follow the vibrations of the universe and are therefore capable of interacting with mass and energy over vast distances.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 6 The Emissary’s Mania</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 6 The Emissary's Mania]</p><table><thead><tr><th>d66</th><th>MANIA</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>11-22</td><td>Latent divinity</td><td>The Symmetry mystic and the explorer share control of the host body without knowledge of each other, taking turns at the wheel. This results in the host body never sleeping. The mystic can only use its powers when in control of the vessel.</td></tr><tr><td>23-31</td><td>Blind faith</td><td>The Emissary has convinced itself that it actually has become the Icon it presents itself as. It forgets everything about its past, both as explorer and mystic. Empathy and MPs are raised by 1 and Reputation is raised by 2.</td></tr><tr><td>32-34</td><td>Decay</td><td>The host body is dying, but the mystic’s mind is clear. It is forced to replace parts of the body with cybernetics and bionics. Choose five cybernetic or bionic talents but lower Reputation, Strength, and HPs by 2.</td></tr><tr><td>35-41</td><td>Blood lust</td><td>The mystic has been corrupted by the darkness and suffers fits of murderous rage (costs 1 DP). Lower Reputation by 4, but raise Agility and HPs by 2.</td></tr><tr><td>42-44</td><td>Wanderlust</td><td>The mystic is no longer fixed to its original host body, and wanders temporarily between the different worshippers that surround it. When the mystic switches bodies, use the stats of the new vessel but raise Wits and Empathy by 2 and MPs by 4. When the mystic forces itself into the mind of a new host (costs 2 DP) it must win an opposed MYSTIC POWERS test. Failure means its spirit is scattered across the cosmos.</td></tr><tr><td>45-54</td><td>Under the influence</td><td>The mystic can only control its host body when it is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The explorer tries to stay away from the strange blackouts, but the mystic spirit keeps tempting it with just one more hit. Lower Wits and MPs by 1, but raise Agility and HPs by 2. The mystic may act normally when in control of the drunk body.</td></tr><tr><td>55-66</td><td>Phobic</td><td>The mystic is more or less in control of its vessel, but has developed an uncontrollable phobia. Can be activated as a Personal problem at the cost of 1–3 DP, depending on its severity.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NEW RULES: RESONANCE</h5><p>Resonance powers are a new group of mystic talents. If they are used by a trained Symmetry mystic, they neither cost nor generate DP. The powers come in four levels, of which the first two are more or less equivalent to some of the regular mystic powers in the Third Horizon described in the Rulebook.</p><ul><li>I – Marked: Instantaneous, limited powers.</li><li>II – Mystic: Powers capable of affecting a small number of people for a short time.</li><li>III – Resonant: Powers capable of affecting an area or a group of people for an extended period of time.</li><li>IV – Santulan: Extraordinary powers capable of producing permanent change.</li></ul><p>Symmetry mystics are as stated above not reliant on DP, but instead draw power from successful dice rolls and meditation. Each time the mystic meditates or makes a successful dice roll, Resonance Points (RSP) are generated (see below).</p><p><strong>Resonance</strong>: Sixes rolled in a skill check not used to achieve bonus effects there and then can be saved as RSP – one extra six equals 1 RSP. Activating a resonance power costs RSP equal to the level of the power (for levels I, II,  and III). A critical success automatically increases the effect of the power one level without extra cost, and it is the only way to activate a level IV power. However, the mystic cannot increase the effect of her power beyond its talent level by achieving a critical success.</p><p><strong>Rerolls</strong>: The Symmetry equivalent of praying for rerolls is for the mystic to focus and merge with its surroundings. This generates no DP but costs 2 RSP. Unless the mystic has 2 RSP to spend, she may not reroll a skill test.</p><p><strong>Meditation</strong>: The mystic’s pool of RSP wanes over time (2 points per twenty-four hours), but it may meditate to refill the pool. Test mystic powers (may not reroll) once per four hours of meditation. All sixes rolled are converted into RSP. The mystic may “store” as many RSP as its Empathy score plus its mystic powers skill level combined.</p><p><strong>Experience</strong>: Each level of a resonance talent costs 5 XP. Mastering all four levels of one power thus costs 20 XP. When purchasing level IV of a resonance talent, the mystic gets 1 additional HP and may raise one attribute of its choice by 1.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESONANCE POWERS</h5><p>The Emissaries can only partially control the powers they wield back in the Second Horizon. All Emissaries have three resonance powers at between levels I and III, of which one must be the Recreate talent at a minimum of level I (see the table above). If you choose a level III power for your Emissary, it does of course also possess that power at levels I and II. Each level of a resonance power is activated as a separate talent and has its own description (see below).</p><p><strong>Activation</strong>: Unless stated otherwise, activating a resonance power is a slow action (3 AP) and requires a successful skill roll.</p><p><strong>Reaction</strong>: Some powers can be used as reactions. This means that they can be activated before or after the Emissary’s slot in the turn order – as long as it has APs left to spend – or normally, like regular actions (see page 83 of the Coriolis Core Rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</p><p><strong>Concentration</strong>: Certain powers require active concentration on the mystic’s part to remain active. The mystic must spend one normal action each turn to maintain focus. If the mystic’s concentration is broken, the power is deactivated. Santulans in the Second Horizon have no need for sleep and can keep powers active for very long periods of time, but as Emissaries, the mystics have only partial control of their host vessels’ bodily functions, and will eventually have to factor in rest.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 7 Resnonance Powers</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 7 Resnonance Powers]</p><table><thead><tr><th>d66</th><th>POWER (LEVEL)</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-10</td><td>Recreate (I): REGENERATION</td><td>Test MYSTIC POWERS instead of MEDICURGY when treating the mystic’s own injuries. May test even if broken, but at –2.</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>Recreate (II): SOOTHING TOUCH</td><td>Test MYSTIC POWERS at +2 instead of MEDICURGY when treating any form of injury, on anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>13-15</td><td>Recreate (III): SCULPT</td><td>The cells are instantaneously recreated. 10 HPs and 4 MPs are restored, one critical injury of your choice is healed and the mystic gains a natural armor rating of 6 for four hours.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Recreate (IV): RESTORATION</td><td>All HPs and MPs are restored, all RPs and critical injuries healed. Permanent effects from previous injuries are also healed. The power can be used on the mystic itself or on another person within Close range.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Translocation (I): MIND WALKER</td><td>Equivalent to the @Item[Mind Walker] talent on page 78 of the Rulebook.</td></tr><tr><td>22-23</td><td>Translocation (II): SPIRIT SHIFT</td><td>The mystic can enter a trance and have its spirit leave the body. The spirit moves ten meters per slow action and experiences visual, auditory, and rudimentary emotional input from within ten meters. The spirit cannot affect the physical world but can move through thin objects. If the host body is damaged, the spirit immediately returns to it.</td></tr><tr><td>24-25</td><td>Translocation (III): ASTRAL TRAVEL</td><td>The mystic can enter a trance and have its spirit leave the body. The spirit moves freely through any material as well as through vacuum at its normal movement rate. Tiny and Small objects can be lifted. Winning an opposed MYSTIC POWERS test allows the mystic to temporarily possess another being. Damage to either of the host bodies results in the spirit returning to the original vessel.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Translocation (IV): TRANSLOCATION</td><td>The mystic can send its spirit to a place it has previously visited in the flesh, regardless of distance. Winning an opposed MYSTIC POWERS test allows the mystic to possess another being for an indefinite time, or until the new host body dies. If the original vessel is destroyed while the mystic is away, its stays in the new body but suffers a mania (see page 337 of the Rulebook @JournalEntry[Diseases and Mind Memes]).</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Telekinesis (I): TELEKINESIS</td><td>Equivalent to the @Item[Telekinesis] talent on page 78 of the Rulebook.</td></tr><tr><td>32-33</td><td>Telekinesis (II): TELEKINETIC BLAST</td><td>A blast capable of knocking people to the ground. A MYSTIC POWERS attack (weapon damage 3, CRIT 2, Short range). Sixes rolled may be divided between targets within Close range of each other.</td></tr><tr><td>34-35</td><td>Telekinesis (III): BARRIER</td><td>Reaction. Concentration. Loose objects from the surroundings form a shield around the mystic. Armor rating 6. Each extra six rolled adds a +3 to the armor rating. Passing through the barrier requires winning an opposed FORCE vs barrier armor rating test.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Telekinesis (IV): MASTER BARRIER</td><td>Concentration. Heavy objects from the surroundings such as rocks, metal, and the ground itself form a shield around the mystic. The barrier has 10 HPs, covers everyone within Close range of the mystic and cannot be passed through. People on the outside risk losing loose items or weapons unless they pass a FORCE test. The barrier can be moved or hurled at targets within Short range as a mystical attack (weapon damage 4, CRIT 1). This destroys the barrier.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>Control (I): STOP</td><td>Equivalent to the @Item[Stop] talent on page 78 of the Rulebook.</td></tr><tr><td>42-43</td><td>Control (II): PREVENT</td><td>The mystic can stop an opponent’s action or reaction (including attacks) by winning an opposed MYSTIC POWERS test. If the mystic wins the roll, each level of success lowers the opponent’s APs by 1. If the opponent is reduced to 0 APs and there are extra sixes left on the roll, each remaining six results in an Initiative penalty of –2 for the opponent.</td></tr><tr><td>44-45</td><td>Control (III): FORBID</td><td>Reaction. Slow action. The mystic can hinder multiple persons in sight from performing actions. Test MYSTIC POWERS. Each six rolled stops one person from acting in her slot in the turn order. Extra sixes can be used to lower the Initiative scores or MPs of affected opponents by 1 per extra six.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>Control (IV): DOMINATE</td><td>Like FORBID above, but the mystic may also choose to maintain its control of the affected characters (concentration). The victims may attempt to break free by achieving a critical success on a MYSTIC POWERS roll (may roll once per turn in combat, or once per minute out of combat) but are otherwise unable to perform actions. Each turn (or minute) under the mystic’s dominance, all victims suffer 2 points of stress. When a victim is reduced to 0 MPs in this way, the mystic can assume direct control of the person and guide its actions for as long as the victim is in sight.</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>Mind shift (I): PREMONITION</td><td>Equivalent to the @Item[Premonition] talent on page 78 of the Rulebook.</td></tr><tr><td>52-53</td><td>Mind shift (II): MIND READER</td><td>Equivalent to the @Item[Mind Reader] talent on page 78 of the Rulebook.</td></tr><tr><td>54-55</td><td>Mind shift (III): SOUL READER</td><td>The mystic can read the mind of someone within Extreme range, including her deepest, most detailed memories and emotions. The mystic remains in control of its own body while doing so and doesn’t have to concentrate.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>Mind shift (IV): MEMORY STEALER</td><td>The mystic can alter someone’s memories (one strong or a few weaker memories). The affected memories are permanently replaced with false ones, but turn into echoes that may appear in dreams around the location where the mystic used the power.</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>Destroy (I): SENSE POSSESSION</td><td>The mystic can sense if a person or object is possessed. The mystic understands the intentions of the intruding spirit but not what or who it is.</td></tr><tr><td>62-63</td><td>Destroy (II): EXORCISM</td><td>Equivalent to the @Item[Exorcist] talent on page 77 of the Rulebook.</td></tr><tr><td>64-65</td><td>Destroy (III): BIND</td><td>The mystic can expel an intruding spirit from itself, someone else, or an object and force it into another person or object by winning an opposed MYSTIC POWERS roll. The spirit is bound to the new person or object until the mystic falls asleep or loses consciousness.</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>Destroy (IV): BANISH</td><td>Like EXORCISM above, but the expelled entity is altogether destroyed and can never return. The spirit’s intentions and emotions linger like echoes in the location of the banishing.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>MISSION SUGGESTIONS</h4><p>If you don’t want to build your own plot from the ground up, a few play-ready missions featuring the mysteries that surround the Emissaries can be found below. They contain suggested clues and rewards, but you are of course free to alter them as you see fit.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CURSE OF THE ABDUSALA</h5><p>The grav projectors have fallen silent and the vibrations have stopped. Her ears are still ringing from the explosion. They must have hit a mine. Pearls of frozen blood spin in the cold darkness on the bridge. Breath in, breath out. Scrape the ice from the helmet visor. Anatu, sensor operator of the torn-apart courier vessel Sans Salim looks up through the hole in the dome. In the pale light from distant Kua, she spots her target as the debris clears – the Abdusala, the ship that came back from the darkness, hidden away at the Legion’s secret Alhudu dockyards.</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: The Abdusala Foundation vessel was investigating the possibilities of reaching the mythical Fourth Horizon when something from the dark void infested the ship and enslaved its crew. The invading intelligence eventually steered the ship back to Border Space where it was discovered and boarded by the Legion who transported the remainder of her crew to Kua. Captain Yasin Sabaaha soon realized that the entity on her ship was calling to her and her crew through some terrible, dark link formed in deep space. To prevent the intelligence from taking control of her crew, Yasin chose to sacrifice them (see page 157 @JournalEntry[01 - Starting Scene - The Dead Marshes]) and was then captured. As the only survivor she was taken to the Legion’s Alhudu docks in the asteroid belt. Meanwhile, the entity onboard the Abdusala began creating a new group of loyal servants…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs are searching for information about what happened to Yasin and the Abdusala after the Cataract collapse, either out of curiosity or because someone has hired them to. Possible employers might be interested in breaking Yasin out of her cell, or the Alhudu might suddenly go silent, and the PCs are sent there to investigate.</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>Yasin tells them that the Abdusala awakened something in the darkness. She can still hear it searching for her, whispering in her mind. The entity is a sort of @Actor[Bah-Jin] that has become one with the ship (see page 331 of the Coriolis Core Rulebook, but add the @Item[Nightveil] ability from page 165)</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>If the PCs manage to save the Legion base or banish the dark entity from the Abdusala, they get a +2 to all further manipulation tests when negotiating with the Legion or the Foundation. They are also allowed to begin using the base as they please and may service their ship there for free.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FACELESS SCAVENGER</h5><p>A quiet song resonates through the dura beams inside the hull. As the melody reaches the scavenger families in the dark underbelly of the bulk hauler, it intensifies. A peaceful stillness falls on the workers of Tameena II as they listen to the song, not understanding the words but still grasping the meaning. The song emanates from the improvised chapel onboard, wedged in-between algae tanks and protein vats. A meditating figure wrapped in Miran silk sits on a prayer rug on the floor, and glyph-covered clay shards move across the embroideries in a strange dance, commanded by the voice of the singing Icon.</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: In the dangerous darkness of the Ash belt or a ship cemetery, an Emissary has taken it upon itself to recreate the technology and weaponry of the Symmetry in the Third Horizon. Acting as leader or patron for a motley crew of scavengers, the mystic collects materials and artifacts from the Portal Wars. Someone else is also interested in the ancient riches however…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs might be hunting for artifacts for the Emissary, or perhaps they cross paths with the Emissary’s scavengers when raiding a derelict vessel. They could also be chasing corsairs through the dark and stumble upon the Emissary, perhaps getting mistaken for pirates themselves!</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>The Emissary can sense the direction of the cadaver clocks that count down to when the warriors of Nazareem’s Sacrifice are coming out of stasis.

The dust on the floor vibrates and the air circulates around a hovering thirteenth figure in the center of the circle. Screams suddenly break the silence. Gunfire echoes. The master descends to the floor and its swirling shawls are caught in the wind. With its eyes closed, the Dancer Emissary becomes one with the moment and begins to move. A final dance before sunset…</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: One of the Emissaries has been working to change the minds of the Firstcome factions that refused to accept the Emissaries as reborn Icons. From the shadows, the Emissary called upon mystics, outcasts, and pariahs, and its worshippers formed the Atbaë Alri – the Followers of the Wind. The Emissary trained them in the use of mysterious energies and they have become capable of changing their surroundings (level II resonance powers, @RollTable[Table 7 Resnonance Powers] on page 193). The cultists are now being hunted down one by one, and the Emissary has gone into hiding. With nowhere left to run, the trap is about to close…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs could be guns-for-hire tasked with eliminating the Emissary, or perhaps infiltrators secretly planning to kidnap the Emissary for their own gain, or help it escape? It is also possible that the Emissary has already been found, and that the PCs have been hired to negotiate a peaceful surrender. After its capture, the PCs could also be planning to threaten or blackmail the jailers for the Emissary’s release.</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>Surviving member of the Albaë Alri are running for their lives, but tell the PCs where they will resurface. They have realized their similarities with the Children of the Song, and aim to seek out the Circle of Seekers to learn more about the Emissaries’ powers.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>A mystic PC may spend 5 XP to acquire a resonance power at level I (or level II, if she already possesses the regular mystic power equivalent of that power at level I). When a PC uses resonance powers, each use generates 1 DP instead of using RSP. Regular mystics can not learn resonance powers above level II.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE MIRAN EXPLORER</h5><p>“This is chief explorer Faisal Kham. The data from probe quadrant 3 is confirmed – the frequency matches the Jarouma pattern. A certain level of deviation is present of course, but it’s well within the acceptable margin. Dania is activating the sensor probe now and initiating data dump. The winds are picking up but we are continuing toward quadrant 4 for the final readings. By the Icons, I think we did it…”</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: The SS-7 is a Foundation research station on one of Xene’s moons. In CC 60, a group of scientists managed to activate the probe network placed in orbit around Xene after the discovery of the similarities between radio frequency patterns around Xene and the Izar net in the Erequ system. The probes were designed to obtain calibrated readings for cross-reference and a group of specialists was called in to retrieve the data from the stormy atmosphere of the gas giant (see table XY). The explorers got trapped, and the minds of the Symmetry mystics possessed their bodies after arriving in the Third Horizon at the heart of the storm. All information about the expedition has been deleted from the records – but there were witnesses…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs might be curious to find out more about the true identity of the Messenger Emissary. Perhaps they try to investigate the arrival of the Emissaries at Xene and find dangerous faction agents silencing all witnesses, or encounter Zalosian martyr warriors plotting against the Foundation?</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>The explorers were recruited from prominent institutes and scientific academies across the Horizon, but they were all without life partners or children – loners whose disappearances would be easier to cover up.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>A relative or friend of one of the missing explorers become a future patron or employer for the group. A portion of their debt is paid off.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE KUAN GENERAL</h5><p>“Hear my words and dream of freedom beyond the Horizon.” A dark silhouette steps out of the shadows. “No palace can rest on a single pillar.” The tall, red-clad figure looks up toward the smoky skies.“We are come together, and the hawks of oppression shall bend before our will.” The light from the fire falls on a set of ancient signet rings on the leader’s hand. A great crowd has gathered around the living Icon, greeting their savior with thundering bursts of Vulcan fire.</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: Under a new leader, the rebel groups have put their differences aside and united to challenge the factions. The charismatic general arrived from the Kua system, without name or history, and entered a political minefield. The negotiations soon faltered, and war broke out. Rumors of the mighty warrior prophet spread from system to system and the ranks of the insurgents grow with each passing day…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs could be hired as negotiators to broker a peace treaty between the parties involved, or perhaps as secret agents tasked with terminating the rebel leader? Is the Emissary’s war with the factions really about liberty, or is it just the only way to take out the servants of darkness?</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>The Emissaries chose different paths after arriving in the Third Horizon to ready its inhabitants for the schemes of the agents of the First Horizon.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>The Emissary’s five rings, ancient artifacts from before the Portal Wars. They count as blessed talismans (+1), one for each of the five Icon Emissaries (see Table XY).</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> IN THE SHADOW OF THE MONOLITH</h5><p>A noticeably uncomfortable Bulletin reporter looks into the camera with the towering shadow of a monolith in the background, pulling her shawl closer around her shoulders. The latest prognoses from the Foundation’s Geo-Physical Institute assure us that the seismological activity and extreme weather witnessed in recent weeks is about to pass.” The reporter flinches as lightning strikes nearby and a heavy rain begins to fall.“There is no reason for concern…”</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: In the last segment, storms and small earthquakes have plagued the area around one of the Horizon’s monoliths. Doomsday cults preach about the end-times in the shanty-towns and the Zenithian scientists try to explain the phenomena as passing and natural. A prophet in red robes moves through the sub-levels of the city, trying to find a way inside the monolith’s glyph-covered halls. The enormous artifacts seems to be protected however, most likely by the same factions who seek to use its secrets for their own gain…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The interior of the monolith is sacred ground. The PCs have perhaps heard rumors of the prophet trying to find a way in, but will they try to help or hinder the Emissary’s plans? Are they more concerned about the safety of the locals, or about the secrets they might unveil if they make it inside?</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>In the inner sanctum, an octagonal chamber with glyph-covered pillars, ancient machinery is coming alive. Bolts of lightning shoot from the top of the monolith toward the sky. Depending on how you play the scenario, the Emissary might explain one of the monolith’s functions to the PCs: it acts as a stabilizer for the universal balance, and the discharge of lightning counteracts the effects of the corruption generated by the nearby portals (the GM’s DP pool is emptied when the monolith discharges).</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>Regardless of which side they choose, the PCs might impress and make friends with people in one of the involved factions (manipulation +2 for future dealings).</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SPIDER’S WEB</h5><p>The well-dressed man places a leather-bound book on the prayer rug. He gently touches the gilded pattern on the spine. His mind wanders across the fields of his home planet, Darakk – a place he will never see again. Security guards arrive to bring him through a sterile, steel corridor onboard the Foundation’s Xene research station. At the airlock, he is greeted by his escort – or perhaps his captors? With unwavering resolve, the Emissary steps through the airlock and boards the ship that will take it out into the Third Horizon.</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: The protection of the Legion is no longer enough to keep the other factions away. Diplomatic pressure and stealth ships threaten the Emissary’s safety. With much secrecy, it is evacuated from the station, but something goes wrong…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs could be travelling to Xene not knowing that they are about to step on a political hornets’ nest, or they might be part of the plans to divert the enemy’s attention while the Emissary is brought to safety. Alternatively, they are secret agents sent to infiltrate the Xene station, only to discover that the Judge’s chamber is empty!</p><p><strong>Clues</strong>:</p><ul><li>The Judge Emissary’s holy book contains ancient Mogul texts from before the Portal Wars. They speak of the First Horizon’s enslaved population and of how the Janhagir fleet left the blood-soaked worlds of the Second Horizon behind for a fresh start as exiles in the Third Horizon.</li><li>The Foundation’s station computer contains encrypted sensor data from the probe network around Xene and from the Izar net in the Erequ system (see page 29 of the Atlas Compendium @JournalEntry[Astrography]). The readings from both locations are eerily similar. The first data entry is from CC 58, and the log ends with the arrival of the Emissaries in CC 60.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>If the Emissary is evacuated without too many incidents, the PCs are rewarded a ship module, a weapon, or some other piece of gear from the Legion’s factionary arsenal. Alternatively, they can purchase the @Item[Licensed] talent (page 73 of the Rulebook) as a group talent for 2 XP per person.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> IZAR’S PRISONER</h5><p>The struggling cooling systems of the stasis pod hiss as the lid slides open. Life returns to heavy, aching limbs and chapped lips. By the door, sensor operator Ghanime makes a strict salute. “Captain, we have arrived at Erequ. Active reading already shows massive activity.” Mercenary captain Latoush groans and reaches for a kameez next to the pod, glances over toward the frozen cargo and gets up to head for the bridge. She views the swarm of transponders surrounding Izar’s black cage on the sensor screens. “Good. The others are already here.”</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: One or several factions have gotten their hands on the sensor readings from the Foundation’s survey of Izar’s net, the hexagonal cage of jet black beams that surrounds the stormy Izar in the Erequ system. They have abducted mystics and brought them here to surround this ancient Symmetry machine (see the Artifacts &amp; Tech supplement). The last piece of the puzzle is the prisoner that just arrived – only the sacrifice of a living Emissary will be strong enough to make the Icons listen…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: This time, the mystics come from all over the Horizon. Perhaps the PCs are hired to smuggle the last shipment of stasis pods to Erequ? Maybe they arrive late, and find nothing there but dead wreckage orbiting the net? They could also have tracked the Emissary down for their own reasons, and have now either infiltrated or joined the secret conspiracy that aims to activate the net to open a portal to the Second Horizon.</p><p><strong>Clues</strong>:</p><ul><li>In CC 58, the Foundation vessel Gyaan V was sent to Erequ under the command of chief explorer Jarouma Had Peleter. Upon their return many segments later, Gyaan V’s sensor data from the Izar net was analyzed and revealed a curious radio wave pattern and strange processes inside the beams of the net that closely resemble the behavior of a portal field.</li><li>In a short vision, the PCs return to Argonnas in the Second Horizon and learn that the Circle of Seekers are the Symmetry’s lost siblings in the Third Horizon.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>Data from the failed attempt to start the Izar machine is very valuable. If the PCs sell to the right faction, they stand to make between 15,000 and 40,000 birr.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MERCHANT OF KALIDHA</h5><p>Sana disembarks from her ship and looks out across Kalidha’s spaceport. Stevedores and merchants move easily through the mess of stacked goods and small kawah trolleys. She clutches the tag with the sensor data in her sweaty palm and keeps her other hand on her holster. What she saw at the portal will haunt her memories for the rest of her life. Suddenly, the crowds part and a silk-draped figure approaches the merciful truth-seeker, the Horizon’s redeemer!</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: The Kalidha commerce station is crowded and lively. The lifeblood of the Horizon – commodities, pilgrims, and information; it all passes through here at some point or another. At the heart of the plot is the Emissary that has taken it upon itself to guard the now closed portals to Taoan (page 184 of the Rulebook @JournalEntry[The Horizon Today]) and eliminate the agents of Nazareem’s Sacrifice that have begun manipulating the factions. Since the Taoan incident, the portal station is under the control of the Legion and the Foundation. The Hegemony’s fleets have formed a blockade around the gas giant Nestero to gain leverage, and two temple cruisers from the Order have forced the Consortium’s mercenary fleets to retreat from Uharu. All it takes now is one little spark…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: Are the PCs part of the Emissary’s network, for example as couriers or as assassins? They could also be impartial in the matter, but trapped on the wrong side of the blockade with no way home, or negotiators hired to calm down the situation.</p><p><strong>Clues</strong>:</p><ul><li>The faction agents all have the same secret orders: don’t draw first blood, and send all sensitive information via special couriers. The PCs find evidence linking these couriers to Nazareem’s Sacrifice.</li><li>Something happens in the chaos at one of the blockades: two butterfly-shaped ships without signatures are caught on camera exiting the portal field, but they disappear into the night before anyone has time to react.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>The PCs become friends of Kalidha and are always welcome to service their ship for free there in the future.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE IMPOSTER</h5><p>“Have you seen the Emissary and heard its words?” The old man pulls up the sleeves of his caftan and leans over toward the proprietor of the chai stand. “Finally, we get to hear the truth.” He takes a little sip of the hot tea. “All we have to do is follow, and obey.” The man holds up his arms to show tattoos of intricate, pre-War design. “Look. The Emissary’s love is all-encompassing. Follow the Icon and walk forever in the light.”</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: A person either from the bottom of society, or someone who has been sidelined in the corridors of power, wakes up one day believing that she has developed strange powers (perhaps she has been possessed?). By presenting herself as one of the Emissaries, the person uses her new-found powers to acquire wealth and status. Worshippers flock to her side, but as time passes, a corrupt hunger for unlimited power grows inside her…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs might be hired to expose the Emissary as a fraud or to stop the spread of its cult. However, they might also believe the Emissary to be genuine, instead seeking to protect it from its enemies.</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>The false Emissary has had a real vision, and can share insights about the real Emissaries, or clues about the location of a cell of Nazareem’s Sacrifice.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>Local law enforcement or the faction whose interests they defended offer the PCs future favors (+2 to manipulation when dealing with this group or faction in the future).</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MINER’S DILEMMA</h5><p>The glow from the holo com lights up the room. Kara forces back her tears and looks at the projection. Her son sits on a cold temple floor. His torso is bare and covered in scars. Five silhouettes stand in a half circle on the edges of the projection men and women Kara has learned to identify as the Warriors of the Holy Light. One of them steps forward and puts a hand on the boy’s shoulder. “You have the place and time for the delivery. Don’t fail us. May you travel in the shadow of the Martyr.”</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: The Warriors of the Holy Light have found an easy way to fund their heinous actions. A sympathizer working at the Asteroid Exports mining company and a corsair captain forced into obedience ensure a steady supply of birr. The neodym bars are valuable enough to be accepted across the Horizon, with no questions asked.</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs might be following up on the martyr strike team’s funding after leaving Kua, or they might be hired anonymously by another cell of the same group to meet the corsair captain and handle a delivery. Or has corsair queen Kara tired of the blackmail and hired the PCs to get her son back?</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>The corsair captain shares just enough information about the strike team for the PCs to be able to track down the cell in question.<br />Reward:</li><li>The owner of Asteroid Exports, Jabil Samem, will become a grateful patron in the future if the PCs helped uncover the truth about the missing neodym.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FATE OF THE SULTRA</h5><p>A young girl walks through the alleys of the shanty-town. She clutches a package of water bottles, fruit, wheat, and pills wrapped in a shawl – today’s alms from the Samaritans and the Agency. This is her home and her earliest memories all contain the feeling of not getting enough air – the taste and smell of dry earth, moldy tents, and rusted fences. A graceless, naked fight for survival. In the evenings, she lies in the dark tent and listens to the grown-ups tell stories around the fire and she forgets her fear and hunger for a while. Her favorite stories are about the palace, and the days before the flood…</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: The flooding of the Sultra valley forced hundreds of thousands of people into refugee camps in the surrounding districts (see page 158 @JournalEntry[01 - Starting Scene - The Dead Marshes]). In the dark control chamber of Cataract 27, a light switches from red to green – the system has finished auto repairs and is ready for a reboot…</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs could be hired to investigate the dam and stumble upon the secret restoration project, or have they been hired to protect the project from intruders perhaps? The debate about the refugee camps is nearing a boiling point and they might also have been hired as negotiators.</p><p><strong>Clue</strong>:</p><ul><li>Not everyone is happy about the possible restoration of the Sultra – the Hegemony and the Syndicate are actively trying to sabotage the attempts to rebuild as they fear it would upset the power balance in the Conglomerate.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>If the dam is brought back online, it will take a long time for the valley to come alive again, but the water level drops and the refugees can start to move back home. Which faction will swoop in to claim the laurels for this noble act, and how much would they be willing to pay for the PCs’ silence?</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CHILDREN OF THE SONG</h5><p>A group of pilgrims fresh off the freighter huddle together in the chaos of the Neoptra – they all have the mystic’s disease and still hear the Emissary’s song reverberating through the station’s beams and windows. They call themselves the Children of the Song, and as their numbers grow, the words of the Messenger Emissary begin to appear as graffiti in the Mulukhad and in the alleys along the Promenade: ”We are the answer to your prayers. When the night is closing in, we are the light of peace.”</p><p><strong>The Situation</strong>: After the death of the Messenger Emissary, civil unrest is escalating both among the common people and in the Spire. The Consortium tries to keep the station together, but the population’s fear of the Icons’ retribution is massive and unpredictable. The Children of the Song begin squatting in a remote area of the station, and the situation soon spirals out of control.</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong>: The PCs might be called upon to negotiate with the leader of the Children, or perhaps to eliminate them. Alternatively, they are hired by the cult to protect its members from persecution. Are they themselves listening for the echoes of the Emissary’s song in the vibrations of the walls and the white noise on the radio?</p><p><strong>Clues</strong>:</p><ul><li>Information found might lead to the location of another Emissary, for example the Dancer and its cult, the Atbaë Alri (see The Caged Dancer).</li><li>The PCs learn that the deceased Emissary lives on as an echo inside mystics and in the void around Coriolis and Kua.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward</strong>:</p><ul><li>The Children of the Song become future patron and employers. They hold many clues about the whereabouts of the remaining Emissaries.</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/04-epilogue/monoliten.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"hW83gJfuhniINm3O","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296898,"modifiedTime":1682695296898,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"wiZzuCkRrtYJsPS0","sort":0,"_id":"6ZBtnxDwjCrpbErm"}

A medically trained PC can offer her comrades professional help here. If Suleiman lit the yellow lightstrips in the floor to guide the PCs to the lab, similar strips were lit all across the ship, and many survivors are now converging on the lab. Apart from the PCs themselves, there are soon a number of survivors to treat (see below). If the PCs manage to settle things peacefully with the nekatra, they too are in need of medical care for radiation poisoning. If the PCs prioritize helping others at the medlab, they are awarded with only the gratefulness of their patients, but it will pay off later in the scenario. Keep the timeframe in mind when the PCs are in the medlab.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>This scene doesn’t provide much in the way of clues as to the fate of the ship, but other survivors might have gotten more out of Suleiman, and can fill in the PCs’ blanks if you’d like.</p><h4>MEDLAB</h4><p>This section of the ship would have been beautiful back in its day – expensive carpets on the floors and colorful mosaics on the walls – but now, everything is dirty, chipped, and faded. The walls of the medlab are made from a soundproof type of ceramic designed to look like sandstone. The smell of disinfectant is masked by the soothing aroma of cedar wood incense. Statues of the Lady of Tears keep watch over the patient rooms, accompanied by the Judge in the operating room.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/medlabb4.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> WAITING ROOM</h5><p>A large open room with patterned carpets and some of its original furniture still intact. A spiral staircase and an (offline) elevator lead from the room to the rest of the ship. The waiting room, with its faded draperies on the walls, becomes a safe place to rest for Ghazali’s weary survivors.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STORAGE ROOM/EXTRA PATIENT ROOM</h5><p>A sterile storage room for medical equipment, to restock the patient rooms or the operating room if necessary. There are also three extra beds here, and some basic monitoring equipment, which enables the PCs to turn the room into another patient room with space for six people. A medkit plus ten extra m-doses can also be found here.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PATIENT ROOM BLUE</h5><p>A patient room equipped to hold seven patients. The walls are modestly decorated with scrolling blue vines on a white background. A medkit plus ten extra m-doses can be found here.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ADMISSION</h5><p>The walls of the room are covered in large screens for patient monitoring. If needed, the room can be converted to fit five additional patients on rugs collected from the waiting room.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PATIENT ROOM PURPLE</h5><p>A room for six patients, similar to the blue room but with purple decorations on the walls. A biomonitor and a medkit, plus ten extra m-doses can be found here.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> OPERATING ROOM</h5><p>An advanced medlab equipped for most procedures. Two patients can be operated on simultaneously. The room contains four cybernetic prostheses (GM decides what kinds of implants) and one hundred trauma doses. The walls are covered in red velvet draperies with silver, gold, and blue embroidery, and the slabs are made from an expensive type of rock from the Dakhara ridge on Kua – custom ordered to comply with the head surgeon’s wishes.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>Below is a list of the NPCs the PCs might encounter during the scene. Khomina and Sabetha Pour are in the medlab when the PCs get there. Brother Ramas and Komoro Vai arrive later.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">KHOMINA, MYSTIC WITH A VISION</div>@Actor[Khomina, Mystic With A Vision]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/spakvinnan4.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>KHOMINA’S PREDICTIONS</h5><p>The PCs might want Khomina to read their fortunes. She will do it exchange for a gift or some birr (about 100 birr). Khomina uses her sugar globe when reading their futures, but you can use the Icon deck if you want. Have the player whose destiny is being read draw three cards from the deck. Prepare the deck with the right cards on top, or tailor the story depending on which cards they draw.</p></div><div class=\"blueheader\">BROTHER RAMAS, SAMARITAN FANATIC</div>@Actor[Brother Ramas, Samaritan Fanatic]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Broder Ramas.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">KOMORO VAI, SELFISH LEADER</div>@Actor[Komoro Vai, Selfish Leader]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Lahor Iades03.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">SURVIVORS</div>@Actor[Survivors]<h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The medlab will likely become the focal point for most of the drama in the scenario. Below is a list of events associated with the medlab for the GM to use as you see fit. They can be used in any order, but it is probably a good idea to have both Brother Ramas and Komoro Vai arrive at the lab shortly after the PCs do. The events have no specified time cost, and some of them can be played in parallel. Discuss with your players to determine how time consuming the events you play should be.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>MOVING AROUND ON THE GHAZALI</h4><p>Try to make the PCs’ expeditions out from the medlab exciting and dramatic. Describe the empty, dark ship, and prepare encounters along their way – other survivors for sure, but perhaps also nekatra with a taste for human flesh? The plan of the Ghazali on page 6 tells you of the radiation levels of the different sections of the ship. Throw in some events from the Through Darkness scene if you haven’t already used them all.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> MORE SURVIVORS</h5><p>As the medlab becomes the base for the evacuation plans, more and more survivors begin showing up there. They trickle in, alone or in small groups, looking for medicine, supplies, and a way off the ship. The looming threat of certain death has made everyone desperate for guidance, and unless the PCs step up to take charge, others will – Khomina, Brother Ramas, and Komoro Vai for example. They won’t be able to get along, and the risk of arguments and even violence is great. Among the survivors is only one with medical training, Samaritan Brother Ramas. He will gladly help anyone who needs care, except for nekatra, as he regards them as subhuman forms of life. His openness toward others will change when Khomina begins preaching her fatalist message (see below). Free trader captain Komoro Vai will take every chance he can get to undermine the PCs’ efforts to organize the evacuation, and fancies himself a much better leader.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ORGANIZING THE EVACUATION</h5><p>The number of survivors at the medlab increases steadily up until the nekatra scene (page 39 @JournalEntry[Hunter and Prey]), when it reaches its peak at a hundred and twenty one people, many of whom are in terrible condition. Evacuating all the survivors will be difficult, but not impossible. The hardest part will be selling the desperate and scared rescue workers on the plan – since the escape ship (a class III freighter) can’t fit them all, and many will have to use other means of transportation. The escape ship can fit eighty people if optimally used (or about forty if the PCs accept Sabetha Pour’s offer, see below) which forces the rest to use the remaining escape pods (holding sixteen people) and stasis containers from the cargo hold (twenty people per container). The cargo container part of the plan will cause much distress among the survivors – no one is particularly keen on the idea of going into stasis and being ejected into space with only the PCs’ promises of retrieval standing between them and a lonely and terrible demise.</p><p>The situation for the people in the escape pods isn’t really any better, but they will at least be awake, and it is enough for them not to argue too much about it. Some of the survivors are so badly wounded that they will die before getting off the Ghazali, and many more will likely perish afterwards. The obviously dying aren’t many, but may become targets for all sorts of morally detestable suggestions when it becomes clear that the escape ship is too small. Komoro Vai will have no qualms whatsoever about leaving them behind. If the PCs play their cards right, the other survivors will accept their proposed evacuation plans, but if they fail, the survivors will split into opposing groups, each with a strong, loud leader. At the cost 1 DP, the situation spirals out of hand and the two groups might attack one another for a spot on the escape ship. If the PCs are armed and willing to defend their claim to the escape ship, the fight among the other survivors will be about who gets to go in the escape pods.</p><p>Have the PCs present their plan to the group and test manipulation. If they make a convincing case, they get a +1 to their roll. Komoro Vai will question their suggestions and try to convince the other survivors that he has a better plan. The PCs must win an opposed manipulation test against Komoro. If they failed their initial roll above, they are treated as being outnumbered by Komoro. If they passed the test, they instead outnumber Komoro and his followers. If they achieve a comparative critical success on the roll, they will benefit from this later in the scenario, at the Hamurabi station. Unless the group has armed themselves at the bridge, you can spend 2 DP to have one of the opposing survivor groups have done so, and this group demands access to the escape vessel at gunpoint. If Komoro wins the opposed manipulation test, about half of the remaining rescue workers start to follow him (one of whom is Brother Ramas). Some of them will carry out his orders without question, and may pose a threat to the PCs.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0–2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE SEER</h5><p>Khomina the mystic is a prominent figure among the survivors. It is very possible that the PCs do as many of the others onboard have – ask her for a blessing or a horoscope. The sick and fading gather around her to find solace in her words, but some of the better off also consult her. Khomina boarded the Ghazali after having visited the Judge Emissary on the Xene station. After meeting the Icon, it dawned on her that joining the Ghazali mission would lead her to salvation – something she has sought desperately since her powers began manifesting half a cycle ago. When the disaster hit, Khomina initially despaired like many others, but then remembered the Judge Emissary’s words and understood her purpose. The truth revealed itself to her – salvation is within reach for everyone onboard! All they have to do is stop resisting and accompany the liner into the white-hot flames of the Hamura star. This radical stance infuriates Brother Ramas when word starts spreading that Khomina has met the Emissary purporting to be the Judge. The Samaritans worship only the Judge, under the name the Martyr, and the mere thought that the Martyr would take on physical form to visit a Foundation research station is blasphemy. Moreover, that the Highest One would advocate suicide – passive martyrdom – is heresy bordering on madness, the absolute antithesis of everything Brother Ramas believes in. The conflict between Khomina and Ramas is described in detail below.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  COME YE FAITHFUL</h5><p>Two among the survivors have personalities and destinies that will come to affect the PCs whether they like it or not. Their respective beliefs spark intense debate concerning the future and politics of the Horizon, and may force the PCs to choose sides in conflicts they have yet to learn about. Most importantly, the line in the sand concerns the Emissaries – especially the one known as the Judge Emissary, seen as a heretic by the Order of the Pariah. The dispute also revolves around the so-called “new mystics” that have begun turning up all around the Horizon – people wielding actual supernatural powers, but rarely without it costing them their sanity. The conflict between Brother Ramas and Khomina begins as soon as Ramas hears of the seer’s meeting with the Judge Emissary. According to Ramas, such a deranged heathen belongs in the Samaritan Sanatorium on Coriolis. When Khomina adds insult to injury by starting to preach submission and acceptance of the coming destruction of the ship, Ramas can no longer contain his emotions. His calm gives way to a more menacing tone – unless Khomina shuts her mouth, she is a heretic that should be dealt with accordingly.</p><p>Brother Ramas will ask the PCs (or someone else, for example Komor Vai) to lock Khomina up somewhere away from the others so she can’t spread her dangerous delusions. If they refuse to help him, he will refuse to treat their injuries. Eventually, some desperate survivor will attempt to carry out Ramas’ task. Ramas himself will not lay a hand on the seer, or defend himself if attacked – he is first and foremost a pacifist and would rather die than break his oath. The outcome of the conflict between Khomina and Ramas depends on how the PCs act. If they do as Ramas asks and detain Khomina, he will continue to treat their injuries and remain loyal to them for the rest of the scenario (even if they lost the opposed manipulation roll against Komoro Vai). If they refuse to help him, others will take their place, potentially leading to a fight if the PCs decide to protect Khomina. Reuse the Survivors stats above for the fight.</p><p>Khomina will follow the Ghazali into the Hamura star unless she is forcibly removed from the ship. If she is made to evacuate the ship, she becomes catatonic (and a suitable candidate for a stay at the Sanatorium, just as Ramas suggested). If the PCs save the mystic’s life, Brother Ramas will show her mercy and arrange for her to receive treatment back at Coriolis. If no one tries to bring Khomina along, Brother Ramas will try to do it himself. Both Brother Ramas and Khomina’s fates are important, and as the GM, you should try to keep them both alive (although they can be replaced in coming scenarios).<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"ASHgxvGWcgVRUn68","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252744,"modifiedTime":1680376252744,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"W11hfVbJtZWbfYpM","sort":0,"_id":"6tKpR4oIqB6zQfmc"}

The PCs’ ship may have been spared, but will require some repairs and a reconfiguration of the ship computer before they can take off.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/hangar2.webp\" /></div><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>Many of the other ships look to be in working order, but hidden faults make traveling in them a deadly game of chance. If you want to, introduce one other ship (besides the PCs’ own) that can be made spaceworthy in a reasonable amount of time – see the Fatima’s Bounty boxed text. The smaller vessels are all docked amidships, around the “waist” of the liner. Several other survivors will likely head that way to see if any of the ships survived the detonation.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>FATIMA’S BOUNTY</h5><p>A new ship is described on page 50 @JournalEntry[Epilogue], which can be used as a way off the Ghazali. It is a class III freighter docked on the port side of the liner. Like the PCs’ ship, it is damaged and requires repairs and a reconfiguration before it can be used. The ship’s transponder contains its identification codes and is linked to the Bulletin’s skipper registry. Should the PCs lay claim to the Bounty, their ownership of the ship will sooner or later come into question as it is registered to a Ninia Skados. Tampering with the transponder is illegal.</p></div><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs can make a quick analysis of the damage to the ships by looking out through a window from the corridor leading to the docks and testing technology. If they fail the test, closer inspections are needed to determine the damage. It will cost them time, and allow other survivors to show up to have a look for themselves. Whether or not any of the others find out which ships are repairable is up to the GM to decide. In order for the PCs to repair their ship, they must pass a technology test. Failure means more time is needed. To reconfigure the ship computer, they must test data djinn. The process takes about three hours, but the computer works on its own and only needs the PCs to initiate the protocols after which they can leave again. Failing the data djinn test adds another three hours to the configuration.</p><h4>THE DOCKS</h4><p>The docks are located amidships on both sides of the ship and the PCs are able to reach their ship through an airlock in one of the two central corridors that run almost all the way from stern to bow. In the space between the corridors is a larger dock housing the Terrim, a now irreparable ship previously used for sub-atmospheric trips. The larger dock can be reached from space through a massive hangar door in the bow of the ship. One can open the doors and activate an ED field to protect the hangar.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>Both @Actor[Sabetha Pour, Smuggler] (page 30) and @Actor[Komoro Vai, Selfish Leader] (page 24) will sooner or later seek out the docks to evaluate potential escape vessels.</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>Sabetha Pour will attempt to persuade or bribe her way onboard the escape ship (opposed manipulation test). She also has a sensitive proposal she wishes to discuss with the PCs (see below). Komoro Vai will head for the docks with a group of thugs as backup to check out potential escape vessels. He will also challenge the PCs for the role of captain of the escape ship. If you want to, you can introduce one additional spaceworthy ship in this scene, Fatima’s Bounty (see box).</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"0Zvbcxm3d5kilMw3","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252688,"modifiedTime":1680376252688,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"W11hfVbJtZWbfYpM","sort":0,"_id":"7VEx77F0JN3ogThr"}

The warning message indicates an emergency reboot after a power failure, but for some reason the restart won’t initiate. The installed djinn software is dead.</li><li><strong>Bad Connection</strong>: As everyone wakes up abruptly and gathers at the lab, the remaining probes show fluctuating readouts. Data transfer from Xene is choppy from packet loss and a bad connection. Hurricane winds and electric discharges are now way beyond simulated values. Historical weather station data has never before logged values this high.</li><li><strong>Quadrant 2</strong>: As the team members scramble to try to force a reboot in quadrant 3 and boost the signal (data djinn aided by technology or science), the dark fate of the Icons strikes once more. The installation in quadrant 2 is hit by a massive electromagnetic discharge, and the system logs multiple hardware failures before it goes offline.</li><li><strong>Lost Connection</strong>: Shortly thereafter, the entire remote data feed goes silent, replaced by static noise. All the frequency readouts in the lab flatline, and darkness descends. Everyone has to make a Wits roll with +1, or lose a Mind Point.</li></ul><p>As the readouts flatline, everyone on the team watches each other with fear in their eyes. Silence turns into action. Suggested solutions are shouted and rejected as everyone panics. Faisal will try to command her team, but if that fails, Jarouma steps in. The situation is clearly dire, but she makes it perfectly clear that failure is not an option: –“Ready the shuttle. There is nothing more to be done from up here.” The team will have to descend into Xene’s stormy atmosphere to manually reboot, repair, and analyze the current state of the pattern. They are not allowed back until they have succeeded.</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The events in Act 2 will build tension and remove hope. During the act, players should go from worrying about the experiment itself, to eventually fearing for their own lives, as they descend into chaos.</p><ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: The team can choose which quadrant to go to first. Q2 for repairs (technology) or Q3 for a software reboot (data djinn). Once those tasks are done, they can activate the grid manually. They will get sensor data from Q1, 2 and 3, but still have to travel to quadrant 4 to gather data from the sensors there, as they are blanked out by atmospheric disturbance.</li><li><strong>Fierce Leader</strong>: Faisal is a determined leader, focused on completing the mission and not failing Jarouma. Regardless of the damage she and her team takes, she talks about it as an acceptable sacrifice – a position she will enforce at knife point, or backed up by Leila’s hidden gun (see @Actor[Leila Hatami], page 208).</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/05-song/INTRÄDET.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DESCENT</h5><p>Everyone scrambles to get their gear in order. An atmospheric shuttle is docked at the airlock, and Leila runs the startup sequence as the rest of the team get into their exos and load up all the equipment. Once aboard, Leila detaches the clamps and steers the shuttle into a drop towards the projected entry point of Xene’s angry, yellow atmosphere. Lightning discharges light up the dense cloud layer, and hurricane whirlwinds form a hazardous wall, threatening to tear the shuttle apart.</p><p>For 1 DP, Leila needs a calculated flight plan, either by herself (with –2 dice), or by shouting to the team to find her a safe path through the storm.</p><ul><li><strong>Calculate</strong>: Use data djinn to look at sensor readouts to calculate a path through the storm in order to reach quadrant 2 or 3’s assumed position.</li><li><strong>Pilot</strong>: Use pilot to descend into the atmosphere, with additional dice from the calculation roll.</li></ul><p>Failure to find a good path will damage the ship (Hull –2, roll for Armor) and knock out some of the sensors (data djinn –1 on future sensor rolls) as the bumpy ride brings the characters straight into a lightning storm.</p><p>Arrival: Finally, the clouds part, and the installation rig lights up in a thunderous flash – makeshift grav projectors and a sensor array, all connected to a small platform and a fragile docking rig. The team has reached their first destination.</p><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP (mandatory, GM receives 4 DP)</p>@JournalEntry[Main Platform Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A CURSED LANDING (SHUTTLE)</h5><p>As the rig appears right in front of the shuttle and Leila initiates the docking sequence, a section of the platform is ripped lose by the strong winds, and metal shrapnel is hurled towards the shuttle. An active sensor operator (data djinn) can detect the problem right before it happens and warn the pilot in time to course-correct. Otherwise, the pilot will have to take evasive actions with a pilot –1 roll.</p><p>Failure results in the shuttle ramming into the platform and partially damaging the sensor array (take 1 hull damage), and forces everyone not specifically strapped in to roll for dexterity to avoid taking 2 damage (armor rolls apply).</p><p>If a character has specifically prayed to the Icons to bless the atmospheric entry, this event costs 2 DP. If no one prayed, it is free.</p><p>Cost: 0, 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> QUADRANT 2 REPAIRS</h5><p>The installation has suffered heavily from the harsh weather. The grav projectors are running on reduced power, and the platform has dropped far below its assigned coordinates. The sensors still work, but the circuits in the installation’s electromagnetic control system are fried.  Without this system, the array can’t be used to correct Xene’s energy pattern using the nodes positioned in the atmosphere.</p><ul><li><strong>Shuttle</strong>: Either the shuttle can tow the platform into position, realigning it (pilot roll with –1), or the grav projectors can be jury-rigged to draw extra power from the reactor and lift the platform into position (technology and science roll). Failure results in the shuttle taking 1 hull damage from the maneuver.</li><li><strong>Reactor Restart</strong>: The reactor is not damaged and can be restarted manually. It is, however, hard to reach, and requires a force roll with –1 to account for the strong winds. Failure results in the team member losing hold and crashing into the railing, taking 1 damage, and losing 1 Mind Point.</li><li><strong>Control System Repair</strong>: The electromagnetic control system runs at half power due to its fried circuits. They can either be repaired in place with a technology –2 roll, or be moved into the workshop of the shuttle, using force (see Reactor Restart to move the equipment). Failure damages the control system severely, and the group’s only options are then to either scavenge for parts by destroying the shuttle’s sensors (gaining +2 to technology), or boost the remaining circuits with a science roll at –1 to take on the extra strain.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> QUADRANT 3 REBOOT</h5><p>The platform at quadrant 3 is in good shape, apart from the deactivated control core. As the shuttle approaches, the sensor operator can detect that a faint remote connection does exist. It is possible to reboot the software without leaving the ship (data djinn).</p><ul><li><strong>Bad Link</strong>: Failing the remote link roll, or, for 1 DP, the remote link can be severed as they approach. The research team will have to land and get out onto the platform for manual connection. It’s a roll for force or dexterity at –1 (with the risk of taking 1 HP and 1 MP of damage), and an easy data djinn (+1) roll to activate the software.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP (mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SEIZURE (LEILA)</h5><p>As a team member returns to the shuttle after an outside task, they discover Leila lying on the floor of the cockpit, shaking with spasmodic force. She has had an epileptic seizure, her cybernetic implants discharging violently. Leila shouts repeatedly if someone comes close: –”Let go of me. Get out! Get out!”</p><ul><li><strong>Invaded Mind</strong>: For Leila’s player, describe how she is experiencing a sense of exhaustion and decreasing peripheral vision, as if the void is closing in. Leila can’t hear her surroundings, and in the distance, what began as a single sharp note, turns into an orchestra of sharp noise. She is instinctively fighting it, hence the violent reaction.</li><li><strong>Caretaker</strong>: A successful roll of command or medicurgy can snap her out of it, but failure means she takes 1 HP and 2 MP of damage.</li><li><strong>Out of Control</strong>: For 1 DP, Leila makes an involuntary melee combat attack using her implants against the helping person. The attack starts out as 3 successes (2 MP of base damage + 1 MP for each of the extra successes). Each six on the roll then removes one of these initial successes (three sixes means no damage, and two means only base damage).</li><li><strong>Sedated</strong>: Drugs can also work, if someone has found the doses of kambra and opor Leila has stashed away somewhere.</li></ul><p>This event can be used on any other member as well. It’s one of the Symmetry mystics trying to make a connection, but the field is not yet stable, and they do not manage to take control of the poor researcher’s body.</p><p>Cost: 2–3 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> JUDGMENT (SHUTTLE/TEAM)</h5><p>As the team is delayed, whether by repairs, traveling to their next destination, or arguing over the mission – one of the massive thunderstorms claims the area. Dense clouds of whirling particles and ominous thunder clashes strike at the members, or their shuttle. The severity of the storm varies depending on how many darkness points the GM spends:</p><ul><li><strong>1 DP</strong>: The wind is charged with crackling electromagnetic particles. Technology is unpredictable, and any use of tabulas or electronic tools, sensors, or similar get a –1 skill roll penalty until the team leaves the current quadrant.</li><li><strong>2 DP</strong>: The shuttle or installation platform is being charged by the electromagnetic particles. Energy builds up and discharge every 30 minutes or so. The discharges count as an attack with five dice, CRIT 3, but can be avoided with a successful roll at –2 for survival, infiltration, or pilot (for the shuttle). The first six counts as 2 points of damage, and every additional six is 1 hull- or health point of damage. The victim may roll for armor.</li><li><strong>3 DP</strong>: A crippling blow strikes the platform or the shuttle. The particles cluster around electronic equipment and find a way inside the thrusters of the shuttle. Everyone in the area suffers from an attack with 6 dice, CRIT 2. Armor is their only protection.</li></ul><p>Cost: 1–3 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A HOLY CAUSE (YORÛG)</h5><p>Yorûg is getting more and more anxious if the team members start discussing aborting the mission. During repairs or other tasks where the members are split up, he will approach individuals to try to convince them about the significance of their mission:</p><p><em>–”This is not just about us, or Jarouma’s experiment. What we are doing here has the potential to shape the Horizon. We have to be willing to bleed for the Icons, to sacrifice ourselves so that they can hear our prayers. They can set things right, as long as we believe.”</em></p><p>He argues that the implication of another type of portal would change everything. He also plays on the suspicions of the one he talks to. If they mistrust another team member, he confirms that fear, if it can win the person over to his side.</p><ul><li><strong>Manipulator</strong>: A player using manipulate for an opposed roll can get more information out of Yorûg. If they intimidate him, he will confess that he is on a holy mission to aid the Icons. If instead they flatter him and play along, or get a great success, he may tell them that there is a living Icon in the Quadrant of the Pillar, hidden away from the prying eyes of greedy Zenithian factions.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DYING LOVE (FAISAL)</h5><p>Up until now, anyone suggesting they abort the mission has been firmly shut down by Faisal. However, suddenly Leila becomes very ill. She suffers from a near fatal epileptic seizure – this time with blood coming out of her nose and mouth. The whites of her eyes turn red from popped blood vessels.</p><ul><li><strong>Invaded Mind</strong>: For Leila’s player, describe how a sharp pain gnaws at the back of her head, and that her eyes are burning. Her vision is quickly reduced to a pin prick. Leila can only hear the rushing sound of her own blood, and a whisper in her native tongue: –”Let go. Rest now and be at peace.”</li><li><strong>Breakdown</strong>: Leila is critically injured (counts as a bleeding gut, see Rulebook page 97 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat], but requires a medicurgy roll at –2 to stabilize). She is in need of proper hospital care within 1D6 hours. Faisal panics. She can’t keep herself collected anymore, and instantly switches from doing everything for the mission, to ordering that it be abandoned – the team has to return to the station, and she will threaten other members to get what she wants.</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SABOTAGE (YORÛG/SHUTTLE)</h5><p>If the arguments within the team shift towards leaving, Yorûg will take extreme measures. He has rigged the reactor of the shuttle to remote detonate (if it’s empty), or if the team members are already inside the shuttle, he has placed smaller charges on the thrusters, forcing the team to make an emergency landing on one of the installation rigs. Yorûg will try to do this discreetly, but if forced, he will activate it in everyone’s plain view:</p><p><em>–”We have to accept our fates. We are one with the Icons, and our sacrifice will open their eyes to the Horizon! I’m sorry my friends, but I have to do this…”</em></p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"bGufTgVfjMpgTpcx","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296190,"modifiedTime":1682695296190,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"093r3LA7rlYhJIsQ","sort":0,"_id":"86hZF3WgpL7TA91l"}

No one comes here voluntarily, unless they are traveling between Coriolis and Mira, or desperate enough to seek fortune and fame in the ruined system.</h3><p><strong>Odacon was colonized</strong> by Firstcome peoples long ago, and used to be a rich system with a large population. Several planets contained big cities and advanced industries. Then came the war. While initially spared, Odacon was hit hard towards the end. The final and most devastating battles of the war took place in the system and caused destruction on a level beyond anything the Horizon had witnessed before, making Odacon the fragmented system it is today.</p><h4>THE DEAD SYSTEM</h4><p>The system contains three planets – Sethlen, Rusah and Qayna – and the scattered remains of a fourth one. None of the planets have any major settlements. The system is much too difficult to navigate for it to be economically viable for any of the Consortium companies to expand here. Odacon has instead become a place for truly daring free trader captains and all sorts of underhanded business. There is no major faction presence here, and the population of the system is spread out in small colonies and independent space stations.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DANGERS OF ODACON</h5><p>That most crews choose other routes than the one through Odacon is no mystery. The dangers here are many, and physical threats like corsairs or remains of ancient war machines are not the only ones – navigating the system is also difficult. Since the war, the star has become unstable and unpredictable. It has cooled down considerably and creates strange gravitational phenomena. Both portals in the system are unstable and require a seasoned captain to be used. Several inexperienced crews have been left stranded here, unable to read their navigation systems.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PORTAL STATION KHÔBAN</h5><p>If the system can be said to have an administrative seat at all, it would be the Khôban portal station. About five hundred souls call Khôban their home, all living in the outer layers of the station while the core modules are slowly decaying. No slummers are allowed in the decrepit parts, but this rule is difficult to enforce. General law enforcement is handled by judicators from Coriolis, but it is the martyr warriors that are protecting Inashar Delion, the Order’s consul to the station, and the Legionnaires that guard the Consortium’s interests that are the actual deterrents to would-be troublemakers. The heart of the station is the hall of the Colonial Agency, where visitors can meet for business or quench their thirst in the cantina.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ECHRON MINING STATION</h5><p>The Echron mining station is a tube several kilometers long and a few hundred meters wide, orbiting Sethlen. Echron has a very important purpose. Sethlen’s extremely high gravity makes it very difficult for heavy freighters to transport ore from the planet and the surrounding moons. Instead, the precious cargo is taken on smaller ships to Echron where it is unloaded and put into a mass accelerator to be fired towards waiting freighters farther out in space.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ASH BELT</h5><p>The Ash belt hangs like a dark shroud in the emptiness between the portals in Odacon. It consists of the remnants of Matush, the fourth planet that was destroyed during the wars, and the pulverized wrecks of enormous armadas. The Ash belt is a gold mine for scrapper crews and adventurers but also contains many dangers. Apart from the mythical Bane of Ashes, the belt is also home to bloodthirsty corsairs, automated battle systems and forgotten mines. Several small asteroid and space station communities nonetheless exist in the depths of the belt.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE AMBASSADORS</h5><p>All of the factions are represented on Khôban by an ambassador, something that is necessary to keep the Free League from gaining economic control over Odacon. The ambassadors meet regularly to discuss important matters, such as what actions must be taken against especially active corsairs for example. The meetings are often mostly a social affair, a pleasant evening with good food and drink. A certain level of political scheming is of course taking place, but it is nowhere near as devious here as it is in the more civilized parts of the Horizon.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> QAYNA’S GLACIER RUINS</h5><p>The planet Qayna is covered in ice. Light and heat from the Odacon star is unable to reach the planet, partly because of the long distance, but mostly because the Ash belt is blocking the way. There are still many more or less intact structures on the planet, but the ice covers everything, making them hard to reach. Several very ambitious projects aimed at finding artifacts or valuable resources can be found here, and interest in Qayna’s secrets is growing steadily. It is only a matter of time before the planet becomes crowded and conflicts arise.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE BANE OF ASH</h4><p>Few things can chill the blood of Odacon’s residents quite like the mention of the Bane of Ashes. It is an entity said to be able to destroy a ship by simply breaking it down, molecule by molecule. Some say that the Bane of Ashes is a semi-intelligent war machine while others believe it to be a chaotic cloud of nanites. The truth about the Bane has yet to be revealed.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/Vy_atlas.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"6XD7DgFU7vNj3kYi","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264833,"modifiedTime":1680376264833,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"8J6j9ZkW2laNmn0k"}

The distance between them is two CU. The captains roll their initiative scores, a <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> roll. They both get one six. Both their <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> skill levels are 3, so chance determines who goes first. The GM rolls the highest – the Tigris is first up. Both ships have an initiative score of 6.</p><h3>TURN 1 – order phase</h3><p>Both the GM and Nikodema, captain of the Narzalus, secretly choose their orders, and then reveal them. They have both chosen the Attack! order. The GM tests <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> for the captain of the Tigris and succeeds – one six. The Tigris will have a +1 bonus for moving towards the Narzalus as well as to any attack rolls for the rest of the turn. Nikodema tests her <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> but fails. She chooses not to pray to the Icons for a reroll, so the PCs will not get any modifiers from Nikodema’s order.</p><h3>TURN 1 – engineer phase</h3><p>The EP of the two ships are now being distributed. Both are class III vessels with unmodified reactors – that means they have 5 EP each. EP distribution is done openly. The GM spends 3 EP on the pilot, 1 on the sensor operator and 1 on the gunner. The engineer on the Narzalus, Nima, spends her EP the same way. None of the engineers wish to perform any actions.</p><h3>TURN 1 – pilot phase</h3><p>The pilots openly declare their actions, the GM going first as he has the initiative. The GM chooses to advance towards the Narzalus, and tests <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">pilot</strong> with a +1 because the pilot follows the Attack! order given by the captain in Phase 1. The GM gets one six and moves the Tigris one segment closer to the Narzalus. The ships are now only one CU apart. Onboard the Narzalus, the pilot Jovun attempts an evasive maneuver (with no bonus). This costs 3 EP. She gets two sixes on her roll, which means that all attacks against the Narzalus suffer a -2 this turn.</p><h3>TURN 1 – sensor phase</h3><p>Time for the sensor operators to act. The GM is up first, and chooses to attempt target lock (1 EP) on the Narzalus. The GM tests <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">data djinn</strong> and gets one six. There is now a lock on the Narzalus with a strength of 1. The sensor operator on the Narzalus, Sabah, immediately attempts to break the lock (1 EP), and tests <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">data djinn</strong> with a -1 (the strength of the enemy lock). Sabah succeeds with two sixes. The lock is broken.</p><h3>TURN 1 – attack phase</h3><p>The GM begins, activating the Tigris’ gunner. He chooses to use the advanced accelerator cannon that costs 1 EP, and tests <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> with a +2 from the weapon (+1 for the cannon and +1 for the “advanced” feature), +1 for the Attack! order, -2 for the evasive maneuver performed by the pilot of the Narzalus, and finally -2 for not having a lock on the target – resulting in a total modifier of -1. Still, he is triumphant – three sixes – and spends two of them on a critical hit. The PCs test the Narzalus’ armor, but rolls no sixes. The Narzalus suffers one point of HP damage, as well as the critical damage “damaged thrusters”, giving her a -2 to Maneuverability. Now, it is time to return fire. As the PCs are fewer than five, they have equipped the Narzalus with the feature Ship Intelligence that acts as gunner, firing their accelerator cannon. It rolls for <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> with a +1 from the weapon bonus. This costs 1 EP. The roll succeeds, showing two sixes, and after the GM fails his armor test, the Tigris suffers two points of hull damage.</p><h3>TURN 2 – order phase</h3><p>The GM and captain Nikodema choose their orders secretly. The GM has picked “Attack!” again. Nikodema chooses “Retreat!”. The GM rolls command and gets two sixes. The Tigris will get a +2 to movement towards the Narzalus and to all attacks. Nikodema rolls command, also scoring two sixes, which means that the Narzalus will get a +2 to movement away from the Tigris.</p><h3>TURN 2 – engineer phase</h3><p>This turn, the GM spends 3 EP on the gunner, 1 on the engineer and 1 on the sensor operator. The engineer on the Tigris uses the EP for the action “repair structural damage”, but fails the <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">technology</strong> roll. Nima of the Narzalus spends 3 EP on the pilot, 1 EP on the engineer and 1 EP on the gunner. Nima then attempts the “repair critical damage” action, and succeeds – the thrusters are now working again.</p><h3>TURN 2 – pilot phase</h3><p>The GM didn’t spend any EP on his pilot, who in turn can’t perform an action. Pilot Jovun on the Narzalus chooses to obey Nikodema’s “Retreat!” order, getting a +2 to her <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">pilot</strong> roll. Despite this, she fails, and the distance between the two vessels remains the same.</p><h3>TURN 2 – sensor phase</h3><p>The GM once again chooses to try and establish a target lock on the Narzalus. He tests <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">data djinn</strong> and gets one six. A strength 1 lock is now in place on the Narzalus, to aid the gunner of the Tigris in the coming phase.</p><h3>TURN 2 – attack phase</h3><p>The GM has prepared a mighty attack for the gunner of the Tigris. He chooses to launch a torpedo. He gets a +7 to the <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> roll (+1 for the torpedo, +2 for the “Attack!” order, +1 for the target lock and +3 for the extra EP allotted to the gunner). The torpedo is launched and hits its target. The GM rolls two sixes, inflicting three points of hull damage. The PCs test their ship’s armor and get one six, but still suffer two points of hull damage. The Narzalus, now down to three Hull Points, fires its accelerator cannon again, testing <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> with a +1 from the weapon bonus, and gets one six. The GM tests the armor of Tigris and gets one six – the attack doesn’t penetrate the thick duralite hull of the Tigris. The battle continues!</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/monoliten_toppen_rymdhamn_kua.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"1yA6H8X98nPVcs0v","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266235,"modifiedTime":1680784899629,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"nRFV3m3MEAgKsrne","sort":0,"_id":"8idWZ8gRpTYvqws8"}

When the raiding parties of rivaling clans stood at the city gates, the sultan spoke so movingly to them that they turned their weapons against their leaders and swore eternal loyalty to the sultan instead – forming the now legendary Bahari bodyguard. </div><br /><br /><div class=\"quoteAuthor\">EARLY RULERS OF THE HORIZON – Sora Moradi</div><hr /><h3>You have created your alter ego in the Third Horizon, and soon you will depart on a great adventure in the Dark between the Stars. But first, you must learn how to overcome the obstacles you will encounter – by using your skills.</h3><p><strong>There are two</strong> kinds of skills: general skills, that anyone can use, and advanced skills, that require specialist training. All skills are described in detail further on in this chapter. Each skill is tied to one of your four attributes: <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">strength</strong>, <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">agility</strong>, <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">wits</strong> and <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">empathy</strong>.<br />Both attributes and skills are measured on a scale of 1 to 5. A higher score is better.</p><h4>Rolling Dice</h4><p>When you are in danger and attempt to accomplish something difficult, your fate is in the hands of the Icons. It is time to bring out some dice! Any six-sided dice will do.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SIXES MEAN SUCCESS</h5><p>When you perform an action, start by describing what your PC tries to accomplish. Then, take as many dice as your skill level in the appropriate skill plus its corresponding attribute. The dice total can be modified by your gear and other external factors. Then, roll your (modified) dice total, all dice at once. For your action to succeed, at least one die must come out a six. If you roll more than one six, you unlock bonus effects.</p><p><strong>Advanced Skills</strong>: You can always test a general skill, even if your skill level is zero – simply roll a number of dice equal to the corresponding attribute only. This is called your Base Chance. To use an advanced skill however, your skill level must be at least 1, otherwise you can’t roll for the skill at all.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>General Skills</h5><ul><li>DEXTERITY (Agility)</li><li>FORCE (Strength)</li><li>INFILTRATION (Agility)</li><li>MANIPULATION (Empathy)</li><li>MELEE COMBAT (Strength)</li><li>OBSERVATION (Wits)</li><li>RANGED COMBAT (Agility)</li><li>SURVIVAL (Wits)</li></ul><h5>Advanced Skills</h5><ul><li>COMMAND (Empathy)</li><li>CULTURE (Empathy)</li><li>DATA DJINN (Wits)</li><li>MEDICURGY (Wits)</li><li>MYSTIC POWERS (Empathy)</li><li>PILOT (Agility)</li><li>SCIENCE (Wits)</li><li>TECHNOLOGY (Wits)</li></ul></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Prospector Sabah hurls herself towards the closing airlock. The GM decides that, to make it in time, Sabah must successfully test dexterity. Sabah has dexterity 1 and agility 3, giving her a total of 4 dice for the roll.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LEVELS OF SUCCESS</h5><p>One six is enough for your action to succeed, but it means you made it just barely. If you roll three or more sixes, you achieve what is called a critical success. Each skill lists its own results corresponding to your level of success later in this chapter.</p><p><strong>Bonus Effects</strong>: Some skills, like <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong>, <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> and <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">pilot</strong>, allow for bonus effects to be “bought” using your extra sixes (if you rolled more than one). These effects and how many sixes they cost are described in Chapter 5 (combat) and Chapter 7 (space combat).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 3.1 LEVELS OF SUCCESS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>NUMBER OF SIXES</th><th>LEVEL OF SUCCESS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Limited Success</td></tr><tr><td>3+</td><td>Critical Success</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Sabah rolls her four dice and gets a six. It’s a limited success. She rolls through the airlock without a second to spare.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ART OF FAILING</h5><p>If you roll no sixes, something goes wrong. You are now in the hands of the GM, and he decides what happens to you. The only thing he cannot say is “nothing happens”. Failure should always have consequences. In some cases, the rules outline what the failure means, but most times, the GM gets to decide. Maybe you hurt yourself, lose an important possession, are forced to take another route to your destination, or maybe a new threat arises. You have one last chance if you are truly desperate to avoid failing a roll – you can pray to the Icons (page 55 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]).</p><p><strong>Combat</strong>: In combat (Chapter 5), the GM doesn’t have to give every failure too much of a consequence. The fact that your attack missed is usually enough, as it is now your enemy’s turn to retaliate. The GM can of course penalize you with extra consequences in combat as well – maybe your missed shot hits someone else instead?</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>DESCRIBE YOUR ACTION</h5><p>In Coriolis, you create your story together. Testing a skill should be a dramatic high point. Start by describing what you intend to do so that everyone knows what is at stake. Then roll the dice. Read the result and describe the outcome – what you do, what you say, what you think, how your enemy reacts. If you send a prayer to the Icons, describe your prayer. Take the dramatic initiative, don’t wait for the GM – only if you overstep your dice result should he stop you.</p></div><h4>Praying to the Icons</h4><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch3/färdigheter_pilot.webp\" /></div><p>When your need is most dire, you can pray to the Icons for help. This means you get to reroll all dice not showing sixes. Which Icon you pray to depends on the skill you just tested – see table 3.2. The prayer doesn’t count towards your actions in the turn (see Chapter 5) and takes no time to perform – you just open yourself up to the energy of the Icons. But this doesn’t come without risk, see below. You will usually only pray to the Icons when your roll has failed, but you could pray even if there were sixes in your initial roll, to get more sixes and unlock more bonus effects. You can only pray to the Icons when testing a skill, not for any other roll. You can only pray once for each roll.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 3.2 ICONS AND SKILLS</h4><p>Which Icon you pray to depends on which skill you just tested. This has no mechanical effect, but should be part of your narrative.</p><ul><li><strong>DEXTERITY</strong>: The Dancer</li><li><strong>FORCE</strong>: The Deckhand</li><li><strong>INFILTRATION</strong>: The Faceless</li><li><strong>MANIPULATION</strong>: The Merchant</li><li><strong>MELEE COMBAT</strong>: The Dancer</li><li><strong>OBSERVATION</strong>: The Gambler</li><li><strong>RANGED COMBAT</strong>: The Judge</li><li><strong>SURVIVAL</strong>: The Traveler</li><li><strong>COMMAND</strong>: The Judge</li><li><strong>CULTURE</strong>: The Traveler</li><li><strong>DATA DJINN</strong>: The Messenger</li><li><strong>MEDICURGY</strong>: The Lady of Tears</li><li><strong>MYSTIC POWERS</strong>: The Faceless</li><li><strong>PILOT</strong>: The Gambler</li><li><strong>SCIENCE</strong>: The Messenger</li><li><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong>: The Messenger</li></ul></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Prospector Sabah raises her shaking hand and fires her Vulcan pistol against the assassin. She has ranged combat 1 and agility 3, so she rolls 4 dice but gets no sixes. She sends a silent prayer to the Judge and rerolls the dice. A six! Sabah closes her eyes and the shot hits. The GM gets a Darkness Point.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PREPARATORY PRAYER AND CHAPELS</h5><p>If you make time for preparatory prayers to a specific Icon before lunging into the fray, you get a +1 modifier to rerolls when you pray to that same Icon anytime later during the session. If the prayer takes place in a chapel, your modifier becomes +2. This is in effect for the rest of the session, but only when you pray to that specific Icon (see table 3.2).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DARK BETWEEN THE STARS</h5><p>The Universe strives towards balance. If you use the power of the Icons to help you, you will sooner or later suffer the backlash, something represented in the game by Darkness Points (DP). Every time you pray to the Icons for a reroll, the GM gets 1 DP. He can use these in a number of ways – see the adjacent list.</p><p>You can use any token you like to keep track of DP – there are many types of gaming markers available in hobby stores; if you don’t have access to those you can use coins, for example. DP can be saved between sessions, so the GM should make a note of his pool at the end of each session. There is no cap on how many DP the GM can have.</p><p><strong>Darkness Points Without Prayer</strong>: The GM can acquire DPs in other ways as well – at portal jumps, during travel in the Dark between the Stars, and when players use mystical powers. Read more in Chapter 15.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">USING DARKNESS POINTS</div><p>The Darkness Points are a dramatic tool for the GM. Using them, he can put obstacles in the PCs’ way or help NPCs in a pinch. The DP also have a psychological effect on the players – seeing the growing pool of tokens becomes an omen that something bad is about to happen. The GM can use his DP whenever or however he wants, to create the most suspense possible. Here is a list of some ways to spend DP, and of how much each usage costs:</p><ul><li><strong>REROLL</strong> – Just like when a PC prays and rerolls, the GM can reroll a skill roll for an NPC. Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>TAKE THE INITIATIVE</strong> – An NPC breaks the turn order and reacts before her slot in the turn. The GM chooses when. Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>EMPTY CLIP</strong> – A PC who is shooting runs out of ammo. The attack is not affected, but the weapon must be reloaded after it. Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>MISFIRE</strong> – A PC’s firearm jams. The attack is lost, and a roll for Technology (a Slow action) is required to fix the weapon. Costs 3 DP.</li><li><strong>REACTIVE ACTION</strong> – Normally, NPCs cannot perform reactive actions in combat (page 84 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). To do so, the GM must spend 1 DP.</li><li><strong>LOST POSSESSION</strong> – A PC has dropped an important possession. The GM decides which. Costs 3 DP.</li><li><strong>REINFORCEMENTS</strong> – The enemy receives unexpected backup. The GM decides the details. Costs 1-3 DP, depending on the reinforcements.</li><li><strong>INNOCENT IN DANGER</strong> – An innocent bystander is suddenly caught in the line of fire and needs help. Will the PCs intervene? Costs 2 DP.</li><li><strong>PERSONAL PROBLEM</strong> – A PC’s personal problem (page 26 @JournalEntry[The Player Character]) affects her in a manner the GM chooses. Costs 1 DP.</li><li><strong>NATURE’S WRATH</strong> – Something dangerous in the environment around the PCs suddenly affects them. It could be collapsing beams or a landslide. Costs 1-3 DP, depending on the level of danger.</li><li><strong>A DARK MIND</strong> – A PC is suddenly stricken with a temporary dark madness. More details in Chapter 14. Costs 1-3 DP.</li><li><strong>THE POWER OF DARKNESS</strong> – Certain talents or abilities can be activated by NPCs or creatures using DP. More details in Chapter 15. The DP cost varies.</li></ul><h4>ONLY ONE CHANCE</h4><p>As a rule, you only have one chance at succeeding with an action. When you have rolled the dice – and prayed to your Icon – you can’t take another shot at doing the exact same thing again. You must change your approach to reaching the goal, or wait for the circumstances to change in some tangible way. Another PC could attempt to succeed where you failed, though.<br />In combat (Chapter 5), the GM should be more permissive. You can keep attacking the same enemy turn after turn, as long as you describe what you do differently to up your chances.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>NPCS AND SKILLS</h5><p>NPCs use Skills just like the PCs. The GM rolls dice for their actions, and can reroll by spending Darkness Points. But the GM should only roll dice when an action directly affects a PC – for example, when an NPC attacks or attempts to rescue a PC. When an NPC takes an action that doesn’t directly affect a PC, the GM is free to decide what happens without dice rolls.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 2.2 SUCCESS CHANCE</h4><table><thead><tr><th>DICE</th><th>CHANCE</th><th>WITH PRAYER</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>17%</td><td>29%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>31%</td><td>50%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>42%</td><td>64%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>52%</td><td>74%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>60%</td><td>81%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>67%</td><td>87%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>72%</td><td>90%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>77%</td><td>93%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>81%</td><td>95%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>84%</td><td>96%</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>MODIFICATION</h4><p>Sometimes, external factors help you reach your goal, giving you extra dice to roll. Sometimes, they work against you, lowering your dice total. These factors are called modifiers.</p><p>A +1 modifier means you get 1 extra die, a +2 modifiers means you get 2 extra dice, and so on. A -1 modifier means you roll 1 less die, a -2 modifier means 2 less dice, and so on.</p><p>There can be several active modifiers at once – add them together to get your modifier total. A +2 and a -1 equals a +1.</p><p>There are four things that can result in modifiers:</p><ul><li>Your gear</li><li>The difficulty of your action</li><li>Assistance from others</li><li>Prayer and preparatory prayer (page 55 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills])</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>ZERO DICE</h4><p>If your modifiers put you at zero dice or fewer, roll two dice – but to succeed, both have to show sixes. Hard, but not impossible!</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GEAR</h5><p>Good gear can give you positive modifiers – usually between +1 and +3. Lists of weapons and other gear can be found in Chapter 6. Modifiers to Medicurgy from medical gear are listed on page 95 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat].</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DIFFICULTY</h5><p>The exact difficulty of your action is often not that important – only challenging actions should demand dice rolls in the first place, after all. But there may be situations when the GM wishes to emphasize that some circumstance or other either makes your action harder or easier to do. Use Table 3.4 for guidance.</p><p>In combat (Chapter 5), the rules often give you modifiers, for example, depending on the distance between your firing position and your target, or when you set up an ambush for your enemies. Some talents (Chapter 4) can also give you positive modifiers.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 3.4 DIFFICULTY</h4><table><thead><tr><th>DIFFICULTY</th><th>MODIFIER</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Child’s Play</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Effortless</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Easy</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Normal</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Demanding</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Hard</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Insane</td><td>-3</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>A while later, Sabah is desperately trying to shake off a pursuing enemy, and attempts to climb over a wall. She must test dexterity again, but the GM deems the climb Hard (-2). Sabah has agility 3 and dexterity 1, but gets only 2 dice.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HELP FROM OTHERS</h5><p>Other PCs or NPCs with at least a level 1 in the skill you are about to test can help you succeed. They must state that they are helping you before you roll the dice. It must also fit with the story – the person assisting you must be where you are and have a reasonable chance of affecting your action. The GM has final say. For every person helping you, you get a +1 modifier. A maximum of three people can help with any one roll, which means that the highest modifier others can give you is +3.</p><p><strong>Combat</strong>: Helping someone perform a slow action counts as a slow action for you as well. Helping someone with a normal or fast action counts as a normal action for you.</p><p><strong>Command</strong>: The Command skill (page 63 @JournalEntry[Advanced Skills]) can be used for more effective assistance. Instead of the automatic +1, a Commander provides a modifier equal to the number of sixes on her Command roll – given that you follow her order, that is. Commanding is always a normal action in combat.</p><p><strong>NPCs</strong> can help each other just like PCs. Having NPCs act as groups rather than individuals is a good way to manage large groups of NPCs in combat (Chapter 5).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Sabah’s friend, the prospector Wali, helps her over the wall. This gives Sabah 1 extra die to roll.</em></p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch3/färdigheter_rörlighet.webp\" /></div><h4>SIMULTANEOUS ACTIONS</h4><p>You and the other PCs cannot help each other when you are acting simultaneously, that is when you are performing the same action at the same time – for example when you are trying to sneak past a guard (<strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong>), or when you walk into an ambush (<strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong>). Then you must all roll separately.</p><p>If the outcome of your roll is really good, some skills allow you to share your success with a friend, who in turn does not have to roll. You can help someone this way even if that person has already failed her roll.</p><h4>OPPOSED ROLLS</h4><p>Sometimes, a six will not be enough to pass a skill test. In these cases, you also have to beat an enemy’s roll. This is called an opposed roll. To win an opposed roll, you have to roll more sixes than your opponent. Each of your opponent’s sixes cancels out one of yours. Only you (the attacker) can pray to the Icons on an opposed roll. Sometimes, you and your opponent will test different skills, sometimes the same. Opposed rolls are always used when you roll for <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong> or <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong>, and when someone uses these skills against you. The GM can also call for an opposed roll when he deems it appropriate, for example <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong> vs <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong> to resolve some armwrestling.</p><p><strong>Combat</strong>: In combat (Chapter 5), an opposed roll only counts as an action for you (the attacker), not for your opponent (the defender).</p><hr /><ul><li>@JournalEntry[General Skills]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Advanced Skills]</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Xr78ZkzISPInxfqX","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265295,"modifiedTime":1680592700555,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"kEBvNyzmJEcxPti6","sort":0,"_id":"8njhf5D1QfUdyYRg"}

The most common theory is that the cryptic Portal Builders constructed the gargantuan pylon as a monument to the civilization they once spread across the Horizon. Despite its unknown origins, it is hard to deny that the strange artifact is among the most impressive sights in the Horizon, and as such, it has become a symbol of the pride the Zenithians place in their own civilization.</p><p>The awe-inspiring glory of the Monolith made it the obvious choice of location for the Quassar family and their followers when they left the Zenith six decades ago. After centuries of cryo dreams, the Zenithian colonists longed for a place to call home. The primordial stone reaching for the sky surrounded by an air of might and stability was perfect. That the Firstcome tribes in the area treated the Monolith with superstitious respect only made it an even better place to settle – if the Zenithians could colonize the house of the gods of old, who could possibly question their right to power? Since then, the Monolith has been the symbol of Zenithian civilization, Kua’s economic expansion and the new order introduced by the colonists from beyond the stars. If Coriolis, constructed from the remains of the Zenith, is the political focal point of the Horizon, then the Monolith is the undisputable citadel of the Zenithian way of life.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/monoliten_2.webp\" /></div><h4>THE HOUSE GUARDS</h4><p>The most visible military presence in the Monolith is the house guards of the bigger families in the Cabinet of Thousands. Every family has their own guard and places great pride in presenting themselves as true patrons of Zenithian culture and power. This is expressed through the house guards’ colorful uniforms and ostentatious ceremonies – a source of much pride and joy to the Zenithians themselves, but it is all a bit much to an outsider. Conglomerate slang for the house guards is “peacock troops”.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PEACOCK TROOPS</h5><p>Quassar’s Janissaries are of course the house guard with the proudest lineage, supposedly descended from military traditions of long lost Al-Ardha. The Janissaries guard the Palace of the Hegemony and view themselves as the crown jewels of Zenithian supremacy. This has resulted in more than one bloody duel between the Janissaries and members of other regiments. Din Hrama’s fearsome 1st Sogoi Battalion are among the more exotic of the house guards, demanding both fear and respect wherever they show up with their vivid feather uniforms and antique long rifles. The Arianites’ Seraphim Guard are equipped with grav belts and old fashioned sail wings, without question giving them the most spectacular entrance when they dive through the clouds in perfect formation.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">GEOGRAPHY OF THE MONOLITH</div><p>The Monolith is almost unbelievably large. From base to top it reaches a little over 4,000 meters into the air, which makes it the largest known building in the Third Horizon. If you are standing by the base or in the Conglomerate, the top is sometimes lost in the clouds, and it is not hard to understand why some say that the towering artifact is the gate to the Icons’ promised lands.</p><p>The Monolith can be divided into three parts:</p><ul><li><strong>COVENANT CITY</strong>, climbing out of the Conglomerate and surrounding the base of the artifact. Visitors from near and far gather here to sign important deals, negotiate with the Zenithian families, or to apply for permits to travel further up the Monolith. Famous locations here include the Covenant ring, full of hotels and restaurants, the Hanging Bazaar with all its exotic goods, and the Wall of the Icons, a holy site covered in mysterious inscriptions.</li><li><strong>THE FORBIDDEN SECTOR</strong>, the area between the top of Covenant City and the lower levels of Sky City. This section contains only a few smaller buildings, a much publicized excavation and the fort of the Astûrban.</li><li><strong>SKY CITY</strong>, home to the Zenithian elite. A place of palaces, gilded colonnades, and exotic parks. The seat of Abarren Quassar and the Cabinet of Thousands.</li></ul><h4>THE CONGLOMERATE</h4><p>Most people see the Conglomerate as an endless city covering most of Kua’s equator, but this is not entirely true. All the different districts, factory islands, and slums combined do cover vast areas, but much of it is abandoned and quickly being reclaimed by the jungle. River deltas run through the city and the water is used as transportation routes for hovercraft or boats. The larger districts have paved roads, mainly used to transport goods with heavier grav craft. The buildings in the Conglomerate range from monstrous sky towers to low hangars and shantytowns. Rooftop farming is common on the larger factory islands.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE QUEEN SLUMMER</h4><p>The Conglomerate is boiling with discontent. The people have had enough of predatory capitalism and Zenithian supremacy and a resistance movement has begun to form over the last few cycles. Its leader is the charismatic young worker Yjala Baktou, scornfully called “the Slum Queen” by the Zenithians in the Monolith. The rebellion has so far been limited to a few neighborhoods on the outskirts of the Conglomerate, but it is spreading inwards quickly.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LITTLE ALGOL</h5><p>Little Algol was one of the first neighborhoods to form when the Zenithians colonized the Monolith, making it even older than Covenant City. What is left of the once vibrant district today is the run-down Dignitary City. Its broken marble stairs and overgrown walkways used to be a place of business and negotiation for the wealthy Zenithian families, but today you will only find a small contract souk here where minor companies, families, and plebeians’ representatives settle contracts about trade and labor. Little Algol has spread slowly over the years – much of it is a slum of decrepit shacks, some of it is buildings or factories of slightly higher standards and a growing part is jungle-covered. The Ramishah river market is a bustling place where long lines of river barges have their cargo unloaded and redistributed to other districts. Since the seventh cataract was closed off after the Mibea offensive, traffic in the Ramishah port has increased, and much cargo is taken straight from the barges onto waiting grav craft bound for Ara-ara.</p><h4>THE DABARAN INTERMEZZO</h4><p>The Zenithians are a proud people who take their holy sites very seriously. The Dabaran poet Galbarul had to learn this the hard and painful way after saying this about the Monolith: “It is a true wonder, without a doubt the mightiest member I have ever seen!” His first (and last) visit to the Monolith ended in disaster – his indecent words caused an outrage and he was immediately deported, his collected works were banned in the Hegemony, and the export of Kuan lumber to the Dabaran courts was halted for several cycles. The conflict was eventually settled in the Council and the miserable poet had to write a sonnet celebrating the glory of the Monolith. Galbarul vanished from the cultural world after this, living in self-imposed exile somewhere in the Horizon.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE AZAËLEANS – DJINN OF THE WOODS</h5><p>The Azaëleans are the largest creatures in the jungle, and some of the tunnels they create under the surface are so big that they can be seen from orbit. Despite the tunnels being very obvious proof of the size of the creatures, no Azaëlean encounter has actually been proven. The tunnels are used for traveling by the jungle tribes and also seem to affect the ecosystem. An expedition from the Foundation, led by the famous zoologist Henam Mirsak, recently departed for the dark woods to solve the mystery of the Azaëleans once and for all, but is missing since hostilities broke out between a logging corporation and a religious enclave.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/monoliten.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"VDfveAqgzkPRpNxX","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266644,"modifiedTime":1680376266644,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"94gtqHwTYkz73JFP"}

Lone ekilibri or skavara are apprehended by the Coriolis Guard and unsentimentally deported to Kua, while nekatra are sold to the arenas. Skavara are pretty deft negotiators, but could also learn enough technical skills to work as deckhands, and they can use both tools and firearms. They are not much for talking, preferring to communicate with sign language, barking and growling. If you like the idea of playing a primitive peddler or engineer with a good eye for liars and ambushes, the skavara could be something for you. Nekatra are best suited for violent professions such as soldier or scout.

If your skill level in an advanced skill is zero, you don’t get to test that skill – you automatically fail. Just like with the general skills above, each skill below lists examples of what failure, limited success and critical success could mean. The GM decides the details.</p><h4>COMMAND (EMPATHY)</h4><p>You are the leader of a ship or maybe a troop of soldiers. In a crisis, you call the shots, but you know that you are never stronger than your unit. Your task is to make sure your comrades perform at their best. Unity is strength.</p><p><strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> uses different rules during space combat (Chapter 7), but can otherwise be used whenever you help others (page 58 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]) – the positive modifier your help gives the other person is equal to the number of sixes on your <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> roll, as long as the other person follows your orders. <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> can also be used to help others recover Mind Points – read more in Chapter 5.</p><h4>CULTURE (EMPATHY)</h4><p>You are a person of wisdom, with insight into a wide array of subjects. You have studied the diverse cultures and peoples of the Horizon, and know of their traditions, faiths and superstitions. You are also familiar with their home planets’ beings and animals. Test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">culture</strong> to see if you can recall something advanced, like the proper greetings among the Sogoi of Kua, the trade routes across the Salam plains on Algol, or if bokor can be driven off through prayer. If you have access to old books, databases or the Foundation’s infologs, you get a positive modifier.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You don’t know, or you are mistaken. The GM gives you false information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>Your knowledge is limited. The GM gives you correct but brief information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You know the subject like the back of your hand, and come to think of something that gives you an extra bonus.</p><h4>DATA DJINN (WITS)</h4><p>Terminals, sensors and advanced data systems are all part of everyday life in the Third Horizon. Most computers are voice operated, but interaction through touchpads, data stylus or via the user’s cybernetics is not uncommon. Most people in the Horizon can use basic data systems, but advanced operations require a data djinn test – for example entering protected systems, modifying or writing new programs, or counteracting spyware and attack memes. <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">data djinn</strong> is also used to operate ship sensors (more in Chapter 7).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>Something goes wrong, and the result is the opposite of what you had hoped.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You reach your goal, but it takes longer than expected, and some sort of complication arises along the way.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You reach your goal, and achieve some unexpected bonus effect (up to the GM).</p><h4>MEDICURGY (WITS)</h4><p>Having this skill means that you are trained in the healing arts, how to care for the ill and the wounded, and how to treat psychic maladies. Skillful medicurgs also perform cosmetic surgery and bionic sculpting. As a medicurg, you also know how to use special medical equipment like med labs, spider doctors and mobile trauma units.</p><p>The main use of <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">medicurgy</strong> is stabilizing and treating wounded people – read more in Chapter 5. The skill can also be used to recover Mind Points and to make diagnoses, for example recognizing drug abuse or the effects of poison, and identifying injuries or psychic illnesses.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You have no idea as to what is ailing the patient, or you make an incorrect diagnosis. The GM gives you partial or false information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You have a good guess as to what the problem might be. The GM gives you correct but brief information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You make a correct diagnosis, and you remember something that gives you an extra bonus.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch3/söka_skydd_medik_strid.webp\" /></div><h4>MYSTIC POWERS (EMPATHY)</h4><p>In the last few years, reports of mystics, people with special powers, have started to surface. The reaction didn’t take long – among the religious cults, mystics have either been murdered or worshipped as heralds of the Icons, depending on the cult’s beliefs. The Bulletin’s newscasts on Coriolis have reported from council meetings on the highest political level debating the legitimacy of the mystical powers.</p><p>To acquire this skill when creating your PC, you must pick the sub-concept Mystic (page 35 @JournalEntry[Fugitive]). You can, however, acquire this skill during play, regardless of concept – this means that dormant powers within you suddenly manifest themselves.<br />Each mystic power counts as a separate talent (Chapter 4). When activating a power, test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">mystic powers</strong>. Each activation gives the GM one Darkness Point.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>The power misfires somehow – giving you false information or some other undesired effect. The GM decides the details.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>Through tremendous concentration and force of will, you activate the power.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>Mystical energies surge through your body, activating the power and triggering an unexpected but positive bonus effect. Details are up to the GM.</p><h4>PILOT (AGILITY)</h4><p>You are one with your ship. You pilot hundreds of tons of metal through the Darkness, you pierce ice winds and mile-high sandstorms and make sure you all live to tell the tale. Roll for <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">pilot</strong> when you operate a vehicle – anything from hoverbikes and ground loaders to gravships and space vessels.</p><p>The rules for using <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">pilot</strong> in space combat can be found in Chapter 7. You will also test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">pilot</strong> when you operate a normal vehicle and attempt a risky maneuver.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You fail. Depending on the circumstances, the outcome can be anything from embarrassing to fatal.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You perform the maneuver with the smallest margin possible.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You perform the maneuver flawlessly, and you achieve an unexpected, positive side effect, such as creating an obstacle for an enemy. The GM decides the details.</p><h4>SCIENCE (WITS)</h4><p>You are an academic trained in the scientific tradition. You are well-read on everything from astrophysics and geochemistry to bionics and socio-arithmetics. Test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">science</strong> to see if you can figure out something that requires advanced scientific knowledge, like how to calculate a portal jump or where to find xenon gas pockets on a frozen megaplanet. If you have access to relevant databases, you get a positive modifier.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You don’t know, or are mistaken. The GM gives you false information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>Your knowledge is limited. The GM gives you correct but brief information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You know the subject like the back of your hand, and come to think of something that gives you an extra bonus.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>UNDERSTANDING ARTIFACTS</h4><p>You can come across strange artifacts on your adventures in the Third Horizon. All artifacts have a knowledge requisite – certain skills or talents you must have to understand the artifact. You must pass a science test to understand how to use the artifact (even if you understand what it is, your PC may not). Each PC can make one attempt. If you fail, you must gather more information – or wait for another PC or the GM to explain the object to you.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch3/forskare.webp\" /></div><h4>TECHNOLOGY (WITS)</h4><p>Others may view technical gadgets as almost magical, but you understand their inner workings. The skill is used when handling machines, mechanics, electronics and explosives. You can repair anything from a small gadget to a spaceship (Chapter 7). The skill is also used when blowing things up.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>Something goes wrong, and the result is the opposite of what you wanted.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You reach your goal, but it takes longer than expected, and some sort of complication arises along the way.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You reach your goal, as well as achieving some unexpected bonus effect.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"u0ulcb0ul9wduFjf","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265086,"modifiedTime":1680592700555,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"kEBvNyzmJEcxPti6","sort":0,"_id":"AfYpn7PI2YDr76Lz"}

The act ends with a scene that ties in with the next scenario of the campaign. Important characters, a starting scene, and a string of following scenes and events are described as in the previous acts.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>The PCs enter the upper Cellar through the Sanatorium and find themselves in The Third Sphere, the domains of Slummer Queen Elmeda. The queen demands tribute to give them a map showing the way to the lower Cellar via the Labyrinth and the Slum Cemetery.

Before the door slides open, a chilling wind blows through the dark corridors behind them. Anxiety suddenly wells up inside them and their hearts race as the reinforced door slowly opens.</p><p>In the dark room, a contorted body lies motionless on a steel bed. Medical apparatuses line the walls. Dirty tools, candles, and incense burners are scattered across a couple of Zalosian prayer rugs on the worn floor. The large windows are covered but a domed skylight lets in a little starlight from above, illuminating a whirling snowfall of dust and ash in the heavy silence. The body on the bed is on its back and partly clothed in a simple, white Miran formal dress. The limbs and facial expression of the Emissary are twisted in a final pose full of pain and despair. The steel bed is cracked, and a fine mesh of cracks in the floor seem to emanate from it. The machinery along the walls is broken and thrown about with bits of plaster from the ceiling lying here and there. It looks as if all loose objects in the room have been pushed away from its center by a powerful shockwave. The body on the bed looks crackled, and is covered with a fine, grey white powder – like ash. The cracks in the dry skin run along the slim, androgynous body up to the face, where the open mouth and the empty eye sockets have expelled a dark, strange substance, now dried. Before the PCs lies that which once was one of the ghosts from Xene – the observer at the Council, the Messenger Icon, Nabi-mu-Qad – but now, only a lifeless husk remains.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><p>THE ICON’S REFLECTION<br />The butterfly’s wings shadow the Horizon.<br />The pain of birth awaits us<br />between moments lived and moments lost.<br />The mirror defines the distance<br />between reflected and reflection.</p><p>– Nabi-mu-Qad, the Messenger Emissary</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESONANCE – THE DREAM</h5><p>Read out the text below or use it as inspiration. Let the PCs react to the event, but not avoid it. All PCs are affected, not just mystics as before.</p><p><em>As you stand above the Emissary’s mummified body, the steel bed suddenly begins to shake and the soot in the air forms a whirlwind above the body. A shrill, high note intensifies inside you, blocking out other sounds, and you feel yourselves start to vibrate. A throbbing headache sets in and your skin begins to crawl as the whirlwind of soot and dust suddenly envelops you.</em></p><p>If there is a mystic in the group, she hears loud chanting as the vibrations intensify.</p><p><em>Suddenly, it appears as if your body and the room vibrate in harmony, and you experience a moment of perfect stillness. Fire bursts forth from the Emissary’s dark eyes and mouth and you are blinded by a bright light as the ground beneath your feet disappears and you are transported somewhere far away.</em></p><p><em>You regain your senses surrounded by terraced fields and high crops. Farther down in the lush, green valley, you see a small group of white, spherical buildings in perfect rows. Two pale suns chase each other across the blue sky. On the horizon, three enormous ziggurats reach for the heavens. A wind chime can be heard somewhere in the distance.</em></p><p><em>You hear singing behind you, and spot someone approaching you across the field. The song is in a foreign tongue but it moves you deeply. The singer, on the other hand, seems quite ordinary; a short, androgynous-looking person dressed in a long, yellow robe with simple floral embroideries in white and gold, held together at the waist with three white ribbons. A red shawl covers the shoulders, a simple hat in many colors protects the shaved head from the sun and tattoos of scrolling vines on the forehead and cheeks – contrasted in gold against the black skin – frame a friendly smile in a weathered face. The singer bows courteously and addresses you, leaning on a short walking stick:</em></p><p><em>“We meet at last. You must pardon me the circumstances, but my vessel has been destroyed and can no longer speak for me. Poor bastard. I was able to repair both the damage from the gas giant’s fumes and withstand the martyrs’ futile attempts at torture, but it would seem that our ancient nemeses finally caught up with me.”</em></p><p><em>The singer looks up toward the hastily darkening sky. A thunderstorm comes rolling down the mountain sides and the wind picks up as a gentle rain begins to fall.</em></p><p><em>“We don’t have much time. The enemy have advanced their plans much further than expected. The Taoan incident was just the beginning. The white butterfly will continue to chip away at the barricade you built all those years ago. Its agents are awakening and my siblings are in danger. We had hoped to reach you sooner, but the song wasn’t strong enough. Together, we hope to stir your forgotten memories and ready you for the coming storm, but the winged shadow threatens everything. Will you fall too, like I have? I am but an echo of my true self, a winged songbird whose frail notes only live in the vibrations of temple windows, in the heaving breath of marble floors and in the sighing of the wind. Without the others, the song will never be strong enough, and without the song, there is no hope for the Third Horizon.”</em></p><p><em>The clouds above are suddenly lit up brightly from behind and a deafening bang reverberates through the valley. The singer looks up and then turns to you again with a troubled look in the piercing eyes.</em></p><p><em>“The butterfly sought to destroy me by sapping energy from the darkness. Something is about to break through. We will meet again, but you must return home now.”</em></p><p><em>The singer bows again, and a blinding flash of light later, you find yourselves back at the hospital in the Sultra next to the Emissary’s dead body. The air above the bed vibrates, and an impossible crack appears at the heart of the vibrations, around which light seems to ripple and bend. A powerful wind roars through the room as the rip widens and flaps of darkness unfold, fluttering like flags in a storm. The Emissary’s body is torn to shreds as if it was a slip of paper and the dark flaps gather to form a grotesque entity crowned in a halo in all the colors of the rainbow. A creature of absolute darkness hisses at you, evoking primordial memories of everything mankind has ever feared.</em></p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SHADOWS OF THE VESTALS</h5><p>The First Horizon agents went to the Kua system to gather information about the plans of the Symmetry. After seeing the strike team fail in its attempts to interrogate the Emissary, the Vestals took over. They used powers drawing on the dark between the stars and were eventually able to destroy the Emissary, ripping the mind of the Symmetry mystic from its broken vessel. This event caused a permanent tear to open in the Third Horizon. Corruption and darkness can leak in through the crack and manifest itself in the area around the hospital. A horrifying darkmorph breaks through, attacking anything that moves – PCs and martyr warriors alike. The creature remains in the world as long as you have DP left to spend.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Ayaam'sha]</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"_id":"k0um2xsGcRy15bIG","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297216,"modifiedTime":1682695297216,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"YOMfroAUYC191oYi","sort":0,"_id":"B1VgcPTO3tl6LQ1T"}

He will wait until he is alone and sure that no one is listening, which may take a while in the crowded, somewhat technophobic Sanatorium. Ramas will contact the PCs and ask them to meet him in the Garden of Seekers during the evening watch. He will keep the call short and to the point, without time for questions, and ask for a meeting time the following day. Unbeknownst to Ramas, the call is being monitored by the martyr strike team that now decides to get rid of both Ramas and the PCs with one swift blow.</p><p>It is early evening and the holo light from the ceiling in the park is slowly fading. The green garden changes into evening dress, cycling through blue and grey, reaching black just when the last visitors start to leave. A group of tarrabs and artists linger, practicing their acrobatics, singing, and juggling torches in the dark, but they eventually pack up as well. Their voices fade as they exit and you are alone – where is Brother Ramas?</p><p>Let the PCs find their own way to the Garden and describe it using the text on the previous page and in the next section. It is important that the PCs watch the other visitors leave and spot the tarrab group (wandering storytellers) practicing. Ramas will show up late, and when he finally arrives, he is interrupted before he can tell his story. The martyr strike team, disguised as tarrabs, attacks!</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>This is the last scene of Act 2 and the most important pieces of information for the PCs to bring into Act 3 are:</p><ul><li>The martyr strike team, a splinter group of the Order of the Pariah, is behind the kidnappings and murders of the station’s mystics.

By tradition, and out of respect for the Seekers, the calm is seldom broken here and violent intentions are left at the gate.<br />The Garden of Seekers consists of around twenty miniature landscapes centered around the Seeker cult’s strange temple in the middle. The place is a collage of beautiful environments from across the Horizon. The Garden of Seekers is described on page 263 in the Coriolis Core Rulebook @JournalEntry[The Core].</p><ul><li><strong>Wahira (Almond Peddler)</strong>: The bent, old Wahira pushes her small trolley around the least hilly parts of the Garden, and wherever she goes, people gather to get a taste of her roasted, salted almonds, sold in cones of old newspaper. Wahira is, despite her age, sharp as a knife and knows the Garden like the back of her hand.</li><li><strong>Iouri Binti Saad (Tarrab)</strong>: A searcher and tarrab from Algol who just recently arrived on Coriolis. He has the mystic’s disease but hides it well, and has sought out the Garden to visit the temple at the center. While waiting to be allowed inside, he spends his days at a pond where circus performers and other tarrabs gather, making a living off of their art.</li></ul><p>Use the map to the left to make the fight in the park dramatic, turning into a deadly game of cat and mouse among the dark trees.</p>@JournalEntry[Garden of Seekers Scene]<h4>NPCS</h4><p>The martyr strike team has sent some of its best warriors to the Garden of the Seekers in order to eliminate the PCs and Brother Ramas. However, none of the warriors are equipped with any of the Order’s secret faction tech.</p>@Actor[Martyr Warriors in the Garden of Seekers]<h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The main event in the scene is the ambush performed by the strike team at the Garden of Seekers.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE AMBUSH</h5><p>The PCs spend the evening watch waiting by a beautiful stone bridge, surrounded by a small lake with exotic Menkar lillies in full bloom. Artists and tarrabs entertain passersby along the neatly raked paths and walkways around them. Four members of the martyr strike team are hiding among the tarrabs, waiting to strike when Brother Ramas arrives. A successful observation test can alert the PCs to the attack a few seconds before it begins, and they can also avoid being surprised if they explicitly say that they keep an eye on the entertainers.</p><ul><li>Brother Ramas shows up late and is notably shaken, walking quickly across the bridge. He looks around nervously and nods to the PCs while taking a tag from his pocket, handing it to them.</li></ul><p>This is when the martyrs attack. One of the jugglers approaches Ramas from behind and fires a Vulcan burst into his back. Unless the PCs are prepared and try to stop the gunman, Ramas will stumble bleeding toward the railing and fall down into the shallow lake. Make sure that the PCs either see him holding the tag in his hand as he falls, or that he has just given it to one of the PCs. It is important that the PCs acquire the tag before they leave the Garden. Unless they focus on helping Ramas, you could let him live long enough to grab onto one of the PCs, hand over the tag and say ”I am so sorry for letting it happen…” before drawing his last breath. As a GM you can use Darkness Points to bring in reinforcements for the strike team (see the rules on page 57 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]). Vigilant PCs may also anticipate the ambush and can thereby get the tag and escape combat.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE TAG</h5><p>After escaping or defeating the warriors, the PCs will need to hide from the judicators and the Guard who quickly arrive at the scene. Judge Kurahan and judicator Akouba can vouch for the PCs' story and loyalty.</p><p>Once in a safe place, the tag containing the following information can be examined:</p><ul><li><strong>The Chosen</strong>: Noor could never rid nemself of the feeling that ne had been given nirs powers for some higher purpose, instead of them just being a side effect of the arrival of the Emissaries, although they started to manifest around that time (as is true for many other new mystics).</li><li><strong>Captured</strong>: As revealed by Robwah and Ramas at the Sanatorium, Noor visited only a few times. The last time ne showed up, ne had fire in nirs eyes and was being escorted by members of the Guard after having been arrested on the Ozone Plaza.</li><li><strong>The Vision</strong>: Noor claimed to have received a vision from the Emissary at the Xene station, and preached violently about the imminent end of the Third Horizon. Ne promised Ramas that he would also come to see “the real change” – the Emissary would show itself to him as well. Brother Ramas didn’t understand if Noor meant the Emissary on Coriolis or the one at the Xene station, the heretical self-proclaimed “Judge.” (Ramas cannot hide his anger at the heresy of the false Icon’s claim, which becomes apparent in his wavering voice and clenched jaw.) When Ramas asked Noor to explain ne<strong>mself, the answer was cryptic</strong>: “There will come a time when the darkness in invited in, when people speak without mouths, when sister betrays sister. Only they who live in the darkness will see the light.”</li><li><strong>Kidnapped</strong>: Shortly thereafter, Noor was removed from Ramas' ward and taken down through the restricted areas of the Sanatorium to the Cellar. This is the last time Ramas saw nem.</li><li><strong>The Cellar</strong>: The tag contains a map showing the way to the Cellar through the lower levels of the Sanatorium. It can guide the PCs through the lower levels of Coriolis and will also give a +2 bonus to any INFILTRATION rolls relating to finding a way through the Sanatorium undetected.</li><li><strong>The Recording</strong>: The newest file on the tag is a holo recording:</li></ul><p>“I don’t know what you have found, and I guess I never will. But I must speak up, even if doing so means betraying my order. Before the Icons, there is no room for lies. A martyr strike team from Zalos is operating on the station with a mandate to wipe out all new mystics. They take them to a place they call “the real sanatorium”. I know that it must be somewhere in the Cellar, but not exactly where. You will have to find it yourselves. Maybe there are others who can help you.”</p><p>Brother Ramas turns to the side as if he heard a noise. He leans forward to terminate the recording.</p><p><em>“Remember me in your prayers.”</em></p><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"b1tubiu0SLdYbGia","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297125,"modifiedTime":1682695297125,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"UTesa86R9Yc5tKiL","sort":0,"_id":"BGP8MJTgN8XAmzTE"}

The PCs must find a working terminal and contact the ship’s computer for a damage report.

The corridors and chambers are all dimly lit by the red emergency lights. Stasis pods and crates of equipment are stacked high everywhere. The stasis beds are either unoccupied, or contain dead rescue workers. Small doors and hatches connect to maintenance ducts where the air is humid, and condensation drips from the ceiling. Foul smells circulate through the barely working ventilation systems. Some of the larger rooms contain vehicles in varying states of disassembly – mainly crawlers and loaders, together with few light scout vehicles. The smell of the exhaust fumes still lingers. The rubber floors and metal walls are painted in a matte, grayish green. Ductwork and cables hang from the ceiling. Everything is relatively worn-down, the rubber floors are scratched and the wall paint chipped. There are plenty of dark corners and crevasses to hide in, should the PCs feel so inclined.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>Below is a description of the NPCs the PCs might encounter in the scene.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">LAHOR IADES, IRRADIATED STEVEDORE</div>@Actor[Lahor Iades, Irradiated Stevedore]<div class=\"blueheader\">DESPERATE, SICK, RESCUE WORKERS</div><ul><li>@Actor[Gemenas]</li><li>@Actor[Ylaria]</li><li>@Actor[Tabrak]</li><li>@Actor[Karel]</li><li>@Actor[Shanaz]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>Below is a list of events for you to use during the PCs’ search for a working terminal. Some of them require DP to activate.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BROKEN TERMINAL</h5><p>The PCs pass a broken terminal. It is either just dark and dead, or the display is so distorted that nothing can be read off it. The speakers hiss with static.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FIRE</h5><p>A corridor or module has caught fire. If the PCs try to pass through the fire, they suffer a Fire 3 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 1. See Fire on page 97 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). Alternatively, they can turn around and look for another way. Unless the fire is put out, there is a risk of it spreading to nearby sections.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RADIATION</h5><p>The PCs enter an area with higher levels of lingering radiation. Parts of the ceiling have collapsed ahead of them and block their way. White fumes leak out of ruptured tubes. If they remain here, they suffer 1 point of radiation per minute. Let the PC with the highest survival score test to spot the danger. Success means being alerted to the radiation. Failure means immediately suffering 1 RP. They can either try to push their way through the debris or turn around. Quickly pushing through the dangerous area requires either a force or a dexterity test. Failure means suffering 2 RPs, success means only 1 RP.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EXPLOSIVE DECOMPRESSION</h5><p>The PCs suddenly hear the hull creaking and sighing nearby. A successful observation or science test can tell them what is about to happen – the wall is about to give way and expose them to the vacuum of space! The automated security systems quickly lock all bulkhead doors around them. See the adjacent box for rules on explosive decompression. Those who passed the observation or science test get a +2 to their subsequent force or dexterity rolls. See page 99 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat] for the rules on vacuum exposure. Fortunately, this section contains an exo locker.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXPLOSIVE DECOMPRESSION</h4><p>When the hull is breached in a section, all nearby loose objects are violently sucked toward the hole. If you wish to move as the section is decompressing, test DEXTERITY at –2. Just grabbing onto something steady requires a FORCE test at –1. Both tests are slow actions. If you are wearing an exo, the tests are without penalties. A critical success can be used to rescue a comrade that failed her roll, or to catch an object within Close range (FORCE) or Short range (DEXTERITY). These rules can also be used during space combat and in firefights near weak points in the hull.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> VICTIMS OF THE NEKATRA</h5><p>The sickening smell of blood and death is heavy in the corridor ahead. At an intersection further ahead, the PCs find four horribly mutilated bodies. Paw prints in the blood trail lead off in several directions. If the PCs loot the bodies, they find a personal communicator, a transactor with 840 birr, and a tool belt containing a set of ordinary tools as well as a hydro spanner (blunt instrument). A group of nekatra have escaped their cages and roam the Ghazali. They are part of the Legion escort, but were placed on the Ghazali as the Zafirah was full. After waking up without their handlers to take care of them, the pack let their primal instincts take over – to hunt, maim, and kill. Read more about @Actor[Nekatra] on page 316 of the Coriolis core rulebook.</p><p>The encounter with the nekatra has been divided into several parts to increase the suspense. The first encounter is the PCs finding the dead bodies described above. They can also hear faint growling nearby. Encountering the nekatra themselves comes later, and will likely end in violence – but depending on the PCs’ actions, things might turn out differently. When finding the mangled corpses, a survival test can reveal what has happened here, and tell the group where the creatures went after the attack. The tracks and the teeth marks on the bodies seem to come from some sort of predator. The attacking group appears to consist of six individuals. They have killed their prey and begun eating, but then been interrupted and left (either because they heard someone approaching or because they are too stressed out to eat). They might return to finish their meal later. The PCs have three options:</p><ol><li>Continue on their way, which – thankfully – is in the opposite direction from where the nekatra went;</li><li>Try to track the beasts by successfully rolling observation to eliminate the threat of them (in which case they should probably arm themselves at the bridge first); or</li><li>Stage an ambush by the dead bodies and attack the nekatra when they return to finish their meal. If the PCs successfully track or stage an ambush of the nekatra, you could have them face a single creature first (see the scene below) instead of the whole pack (page 39 @JournalEntry[Hunter and Prey]).</li></ol><p><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DESPERATE RESCUE WORKERS</h5><p>Have the PCs test observation. If they pass, they hear whispering voices in the corridor ahead. Unless they turn around, they soon meet a group consisting of six other survivors led by the aggressive Lahor Iades. The encounter might lead to violence, or at least to high tensions. Unless the PCs have figured out what has killed the majority of the other passengers (radiation) – and that they are likely affected themselves – they probably will now. Have them test manipulation. If they roll well, Lahor’s group will follow their instructions, but failure might lead to hostilities. The other group want to: 1) Find medicine and other useful gear; 2) Find a place sheltered from radiation and nekatra (they have heard the beasts in the distance and lost a comrade); and 3) Find a way off the doomed ship. They know nothing of what has happened to the Ghazali and have encountered no other survivors, but know that the ship is heavily irradiated and that terrible monsters are on the prowl nearby.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"mju3IA5QFIj6OuVT","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252765,"modifiedTime":1680376252765,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"1fwOiyHqfa7kK99F","sort":0,"_id":"BkQfu5Bw6UYH7k40"}

If you have business in the Cellar, put on some protective gear and buy a gun. As the gravity down here is unstable it is good to be acquainted with zero-G. Roughly speaking, the Cellar can be divided into a higher, less decrepit part, and a lower, very worn down part. The floors of the Cellar are not named or numbered, and the only maps that exist are hand-made by the service personnel with the bitter jobs of tending to the systems down here.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE UPPER CELLAR</h5><p>The higher floors are worn and desolate but basically in working order. They are sometimes used for docking and unloading when the Net is busy with a bulk hauler. The Guard patrols the upper levels and are responsible for repairs.

Its reputation speaks of high stakes and even higher takings – if you manage to win and make it out alive, you can live out your days like a pasha. The Sewers are run by the enigmatic Mida, who recently strong-armed the Free League into giving up their control of the place, something they are less than happy with. The Sewers consists of three parts: the Bazaar, Jacinto’s Cantina, and the Pit, where actual gladiator matches supposedly take place.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/källaren_coriolis.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">A corridor in the Cellar</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.9 ENCOUNTERS IN THE CELLAR</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.9 Encounters in the Cellar]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Fero</td><td>Maintenance technician</td><td>Hums constantly</td><td>Repairing something</td><td>Vacation</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Mako</td><td>Party animal</td><td>Strung out</td><td>Trying to get home</td><td>A nice kabab</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Lubub</td><td>Thief</td><td>Long hair</td><td>Stealing something</td><td>Return home</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Renaveh</td><td>Revolutionary</td><td>Red guttrah</td><td>Hiding</td><td>Justice</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Letui</td><td>Smuggler</td><td>Fiddles with carbine</td><td>Loading cargo</td><td>Kohôl</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Humgurrl</td><td>Nekatra</td><td>Matted fur, growls</td><td>Looking for food</td><td>Survival</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>THE AQUEDUCT OF ZAKARA</h4><p>The students of Coriolis speak of “Zakara’s” in romantic terms as, traditionally, many of them ohave visited the aqueduct for romance as well as for sins of the flesh.

The system is ruled by the Order of the Pariah, a faction with a dual reputation for being both devout, helpful believers and bloodthirsty fanatics. Not much is known about Zalos as the Order is very strict about who they let in.</h3><p>What little common people in the Horizon know is usually based on rumors and third-party sources, and those who have actually visited Zalos in recent years can only share their experiences of the City of Foreigners. Zalos is a binary system with two habitable planets, one orbiting each star. A third planet, Benagia, used to be inhabited, but it suffered such terrible bombardments during the Portal Wars that it is uninhabitable today. Several moons have been colonized, with Karrmerruk, orbiting Benagia, being the most famous. Many small space stations are also scattered across the system.</p><p>The Martyr Council, a constantly changing group of priests, prophets, grand masters and elders, governs the Order of the Pariah. Rumors claim that the Council let archaic rites and divination decide how Zalos should be ruled. Regardless of their practices, the Martyr Council is the dominant political force in the system, and they are seldom contradicted.</p><h4>THE WAR ON HERESY</h4><p>The largest conflict in Zalos is the civil war, raging across all of Zalos-B. Large portions of the planet’s population have succumbed to heresy and started worshipping false prophets. They have left the embrace of the Martyr and taken up arms against their former brothers and sisters. The war is everywhere and very bloody, with everything from small guerilla raids to full-scale military campaigns. The Order focuses much of their resources on crushing the rebels, but has so far not been successful. Both sides in the conflict possess advanced antimatter weapons, golim armors and bionics that don’t exist outside of Zalos, making them evenly matched. If it wasn’t for the total fleet blockade around Zalos-B, the rebellion might have spread to the rest of the system.</p><h4>UNDER THE GAZE OF THE MARTYR</h4><p>All larger communities on Zalos are built around large monastery complexes from which the Order controls the area. The monasteries often house hundreds of order members and are always heavily fortified. Every day, the residents of the surrounding areas make their way to the monasteries for mass and flagellation in honor of the Martyr. The cities are made of stone, with prayer towers, high pointed roofs, narrow alleys and few open spaces. The cities of Zalos-A are busy and labyrinthine, while large parts of the cities on Zalos-B have been reduced to ruins and dust by the war.</p><p>Certain things remain constant in the lives of the system’s inhabitants. Prayer and flagellation are important on both Zalos-A and B. Faith defines every aspect of life, from family relations to work and warfare.</p><h4>THE CHORAL STATIONS</h4><p>Several smaller cults within the Order have fled out into space to escape the war. One such cult is the Hymns of the End Times. They have constructed the eight so-called Choral stations that are spread across the system. All day, every day, the End Times’ choirs and flagellants are lined up in ingeniously constructed halls, singing. Grand polyphonic choir pieces blended with the wailing from the flagellants are transmitted across many frequencies to the whole system, in the Martyr’s undying praise. Visiting traders have had to shut off all incoming radio traffic to avoid the cacophony.</p><h4>KIANAAR’S SPICERY</h4><p>The Order of the Pariah have an ambivalent view on drugs, and look the other way with cults such as the Children of Kianaar, whose members seldom come out from their deep drug haze. The Children control the trade of herbs, mushrooms and minerals from Zalos-A, ingredients used to create both spices and potent drugs. The cult lives on a space station called Kianaar’s Spicery in the far reaches of the system. The station enjoys an almost mythical reputation in the underworld of the Horizon. Although the drugs produced here are of the highest standards, the station itself is not. More than a few visiting aristocrats have lost both their wallets and their lives in the Spicery’s dark corridors.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE HAMMER OF THE MARTYR</h4><p>The Hammer of the Martyr is a battle cruiser permanently stationed just above the City of Foreigners, serving as a constant reminder of the might of the Order’s fleets. The Hammer is an awe-inspiring view, covered in towers, battlements and ornate weapon stations.</p></div><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/dds.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">A shuttle approaching the battle cruiser The Hammer of the Martyr.</p><p></p><h1>KARRMERRUK</h1><hr /><p>Not far from the portals, orbiting the burnt-out planet Benagia, you will find the Karrmerruk moon. Since the Order sealed off their system, the City of Foreigners on Karrmerruk is the only place where off-worlders are allowed to trade. The city is built under a series of domes arranged in the shape of one of the Order’s holiest symbols, the Sickle of the Martyr. The atmosphere outside of the domes is cold and almost without oxygen.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE CROWN OF THE MARTYR</h5><p>Every once in a while, powerful solar storms rage across Zalos-A and much of the system is hit by strong star winds. During the storms, a jagged pattern is visible surrounding the star, uneven spikes of light against the black void. The Order calls this phenomenon the Crown of the Martyr. Among those who still view the Order as dangerous fanatics, it is believed that the worst prophecies mumbled by the Order’s elders emanate from the Crown.</p></div><h4>THE DOMES</h4><p>The commerce district is located underneath the largest dome, the Souk of Mists under the second largest, and the rest of the domes cover the monastery quarters’ grand temples and military installations. The bells and prayer calls from the monasteries echo across the entire city, leading both locals and foreigners in prayer. A condition for being allowed into the City of Foreigners is that one praises the Icons every day. The fourth dome is in ruins after an attack by a group of suicide bombers, likely connected to the heathens on Zalos-B. The last two domes contain Assir’s gardens and the 11th ossuary.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MARTYR’S SPACEPORT</h5><p>The Order’s entire culture is centered on worshipping the Martyr. The other Icons are only bleak and pointless shadows to the true believers, false manifestations of the omnipotence of the Martyr. The Order expects all visitors to Karrmerruk to show proper respects to the Martyr. Priests are ready and waiting in the spaceport chapels to guide the heathens towards the light. Talismans and rites associated with the other Icons are allowed, but prayers and rituals dedicated to them must end in praise of the Martyr.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  KORAZAN’S HALLS</h5><p>Large-scale business with the Order is only allowed in the commerce district. Foreign traders who try to trade in bulk directly with shops and companies in the Souk of Mist for example will find themselves facing immediate deportation without a chance to explain themselves. Off-worlders are only supposed to trade with merchants specially appointed by the Order. The largest deals always take place in Korazan’s halls, located on the outskirts of the commerce district, next to the spaceport. It is a big complex of halls and warehouses devoted solely to foreign trade.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SOUK OF MIST</h5><p>The Souk of Mist is located under the City of Foreigners’ second largest dome. A constant fog covers the bazaar at the center of the district as well as the surrounding blocks. The souk is a bustling marketplace with narrow alleys and tiny plazas, two or even three stories high in some parts. Visitors from all across the Horizon can mingle with the locals here, pause in one of the small kawah shops, listen to the street musicians, pray in the chapels or just do business. To residents of Karrmerruk, the souk is the only place where one can purchase goods not manufactured in the Zalos system.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Ua7VFvV4ygm4kjjc","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264827,"modifiedTime":1680376264827,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"CPwJOuyTNHVcbLoG"}

The simple quarters consist of a common area, gym, a small kitchen and recreation area, as well as the crew’s small sleeping pods. After their usual morning routine of heated honey-water and protein porridge, the researchers head to the lab section of the wheel. A small research lab with the latest equipment, as well as an engineering workshop, both connected to the closed off, and legionaire-guarded corridor leading to the only airlock. In the other direction lies the corridor leading back to the main shaft and the rest of the station. A large bulkhead with electronic locks and three stern station guards stands in the way of breaking the research team’s long isolation.</p><p><em>Everyone is ready for a day of final calibrations and system checks. Tomorrow will be a grand day, and everyone is on edge. In one day, Chief Scientist Jarouma Had Peleter will arrive to oversee the project. It’s time to activate the installation; a remote-controlled array of machines floating in Xene’s atmosphere, with the sole purpose of gradually shifting the magnetic fields and electromagnetic currents to match the previously discovered fluctuations known as the Jarouma Pattern.</em></p>@JournalEntry[Isolated Research Facility Scene]<h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The arrival of Jarouma, and remotely activating the grid located within Xene’s atmosphere, are both part of the first day. However, after a few hours, sensor data and any communication with the installations will be lost. Before that happens though, the GM may use one or more of the personal events to incite suspicion and distrust within the group.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EARLY ARRIVAL</h5><p>A day earlier than anticipated, the proximity alert is heard throughout section 31. It’s an announcement: –”Visiting shuttle is arriving in ten minutes. Prepare for VIP protocol at airlock 31A”.</p><p>A group of five legionnaires arrive from the main corridor, doors hissing shut behind them. They form up with the other three guards in front of the airlock doors as the unexpected visitors enter the complex. Jarouma Had Peleter, the explorer that discovered the pattern at Izar, and the brain behind this entire initiative. She walks in dressed in gold and bright red, followed by a more conservatively dressed research assistant. Her stern face is covered with the white paint of Zenithian nobility. She greets the team leader, Faisal, and has a brief conversation before she addresses the entire team: –”No more delays. We go active now. I don’t want any excuses. In one hour we will launch.”</p><p>There are complaints. The ninth day was selected specifically to let the Icons bless the project, and starting a day early is risky, but Jarouma won’t hear any of it. She moves off to the lab with a detail of two bodyguards, expecting the team to follow. This change of events sends a cold shiver down the spine of the team members.</p><p>Cost: 0 (mandatory, GM receives 1 DP)</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/05-song/JAROUMA’S_ENTRY.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CHECK AND CHECK AGAIN (YORÛG)</h5><p>As the team calibrates the equipment before countdown, under Jarouma’s vigilant eyes, Yorûg is noticeably anxious. He checks every configuration multiple times, and someone may notice that he’s almost at the breaking point, muttering to himself: – “It has to work, there is no other alternative. Everything depends on it.”</p><p>He prays to the Traveler with tears in his eyes and needs help (command or manipulation) to break out of his obsessive praying.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>PERSONAL EVENTS</h4><p>Several events are directly connected to specific scenario characters. They should primarily be used by the GM to portray the non-player characters. However, they can also be suggested scenes for the player-controlled characters to initiate. If the events are used by the players, they do not cost any darkness points, and the outcome is completely player-driven.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> COUNTDOWN CYCLE</h5><p>The team goes through their routine checks, preparing for the activation. The hardware needs to be stabilized and set to the right configuration with a technology roll. The arrays on Xene require remote calibration with data djinn, and the exact order of activation is defined with science. All of these duties are performed by the team members under high stress (–1 to the die roll). Any failure risks building up tension and delays the procedure, angering Jarouma if discovered. Each failed roll also generates 1 DP, and the character loses 1 Mind Point.</p><ul><li><strong>Activation</strong>: Once all checks have been performed, the project is ready. Almost a cycle of preparations has led to this moment. Faisal nods to Jarouma and indicates the main panel: “We are ready. Everything is ready. You will have the honor.” Jarouma enters the initialization code, and all the tabulas and holograms light up.</li><li><strong>Success</strong>: At first there is nothing, but then a set of frequency patterns blinks into existence. One for each quadrant of Xene. They are mapped to replicate the pattern from Izar. Graphs detail any deviations, and none of them has currently hit the right frequency. Everyone holds their breath, too nervous to speak, but after a painfully long period of nothing, suddenly one of the quadrant readouts changes, and gradually falls more in line with the original pattern. The long period of stress and hard work has panned out. The release of tension is palpable in the lab.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 (mandatory)</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SHUTTLE PILOT</h4><p>If Leila is a player character, the GM can pull her away with a secret order after breakfast, to fly the shuttle to a nearby Legion cruiser and pickup a VIP executive (Jarouma).</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BLIND SPOT</h5><p>Something goes wrong. This can happen during preparations or right after activation. One of the sensory arrays down on Xene suddenly deactivates. At first, the readout says it has suffered damage, but then it comes back online. A roll for data djinn shows that there are atmospheric disturbances that temporarily blocked the signal.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SHAKES (LEILA)</h5><p>Leila takes a back seat as the installation is activated. Her normal duties of transporting material, or flying the shuttle during the probe installations down on Xene, are both far different from what’s currently happening. Normally she would help out with any data djinn-related tasks, but when asked, she distinctly and angrily says no: –”We’ve done this simulation a thousand times. You can’t be that incompetent? Just do your job, and I’ll do mine.”</p><p>Her lashing out is followed by leaving. Once away from prying eyes, she grabs her right arm, which now shakes visibly. She bites her lip desperately, stopping her teeth from chattering as sweat breaks out on her forehead. She leaves for her quarters in secret, to take a dose of her stashed kambra drugs, and returns with new vigor, changed back into her old, assertive self.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DATA DUMP (ALAM)</h5><p>A few hours after activation, the research team gets their first break since the installation went online. Only Alam and one other member remain in the lab as the others go to the kitchen area for food and some brief rest. She will try to convince the remaining person to take a brief break as well – she can handle the readouts and data cores for a while. Regardless of whether she manages to be alone or not, Alam then discretly attaches a tag to the data core, and starts transfering sensor data and blueprints from the project.</p><p>If she’s caught and accused, she will only say that the data is so crucial that it requires a secondary backup – when in actuality the data is for further distribution to the Free League if the Foundation chooses to keep the experiment a secret in the future.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SACRIFICE (HARISH)</h5><p>As the grid installed on Xene is activated, Harish is nowhere to be seen. She has left the lab and taken a few minutes alone in the common area of the living quarters, away from prying eyes. Deep in thought, she prays to the Lady of Tears to bless the project and the station.</p><p>In prayer, she remembers the terrors of losing her friends aboard Huma (see her secret), and starts cutting her already scarred arm to numb the mental pain. The character loses 1 Mind Point.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DISTURBANCE</h5><p>As the situation is monitored throughout the day, the team calms down. They even start celebrating. That’s when someone notices the additional readouts from the weather stations. Xene’s atmosphere is in turmoil. A massive storm is building up, and electromagnetic discharges are reaching the limits of what has been simulated. Faisal assures Jarouma that the installed arrays will hold. There is no need to worry. But as the day ends and the team splits up into surveillance shifts for the night, the anxiety is back, and a lump of dread has lodged itself in everyone’s gut.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (mandatory)</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"4CMCgAOTUhupuOCN","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296201,"modifiedTime":1682695296201,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"orHFA5UoBHKJSKRM","sort":0,"_id":"EBarQHGXZybiJMcd"}

Items like these can be the difference between an affluent life in the Spire of Coriolis or dying from dehydration in the salt deserts of Dabaran. This chapter describes all the kinds of gear and equipment the PCs might need.</h3><h4>TECHNOLOGY TIERS</h4><p>The technology of the Third Horizon is divided into different tiers: Primitive, Ordinary and Advanced, plus the mysterious faction technology and whatever the Portal Builders left behind, if it can be understood at all. Primitive technology is the remains of the tech brought by the first waves of Firstcome colonists, adapted to local environments and materials. Ordinary technology is the bulk of everything produced and used by ordinary people, with exceptions for the more barbaric areas or very poor colonies. Ordinary tech is produced in modular designs to make repairs and modifications easy. It is exported and imported all across the cluster. Advanced technology is the high end of the tech available on the open market, as long as you can afford it, have the proper connections and make the purchase in technologically advanced places such as Coriolis, the Conglomerate, the Monolith or other large trade stations and cities.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESTRICTED ITEMS</h5><p>Certain items, regardless of the tech tier, are harder to come by than others – they could require certain licenses, be outlawed or just be available to those with friends in the right places. These items are marked with an asterisk (*) indicating that they are restricted items. Restricted gear can only be purchased by PCs with the Licensed talent (see Chapter 4).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FACTION TECHNOLOGY</h5><p>The technology of the factions, usually called Faction tech, differs from Advanced technology mostly in its availability – or rather, lack thereof. Advanced technology can be purchased by anyone on a core world with enough birr, but the faction tech is available only to a select few who have pledged their allegiance to the agenda of the faction in question, or at the very least have formed a strong alliance with it. Huge amounts of birr will of course also be necessary. Faction tech is not described in detail in this book, as it will not be available to new PCs. The only way to come by it is through contacts in a faction, or theft.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h5>KNOWN FACTION TECH</h5><p>Despite the efforts of the factions to keep their technology secret, rumors about it are spread far and wide. The Consortium are known for their technological wonders – gigantic combat exos called Walkers that were field tested during the Uharu conflict, advanced warships and portal blades that are said to cut through armored warriors like grass. The Order of the Pariah are known for their animaturgical skills, resulting in the animated armor suits and their antimatter tech. Most people also know about the Hegemony’s fearsome arachnid armors, used by the Astûrban.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PORTAL BUILDER TECHNOLOGY</h5><p>Relics from the Portal Builders and other old artifacts are only understood by a few people in the Horizon. Both the Foundation and the Special Branch are rumored to have cracked some of the secrets of the Portal Builders.

The head of the masked clergy, Aremerat, claims to have been chosen directly by the Icons. It is an insular system, and news from the rest of the Horizon is subject to strict control and censoring.</h3><p><strong>Sadaal is a</strong> binary system. Both stars, Sadaal and Bahram, each have one planet with good conditions for human settlement. The planet Sadaal is dominated by high mountains and dry steppes, while Bahram is covered in oceans, marshes, and wide plains of farmland. Emigration is not permitted from the system, but the Consortium and a few other groups have been allowed to establish themselves here in recent years.</p><h4>THE EIGHT WISDOMS</h4><p>The most powerful group in Sadaal is without question the hierocrats in Amesha Spenta, The Eight Wisdoms. These high priests interpret the words of Aremerat and are the de facto rulers in all matters. Each of the eight Ameshas represents one Icon and controls an institute devoted to the domain of that Icon, as it is understood in Sadaal. The ninth Icon, the Whisperer – called the Faceless One elsewhere – has no representative in Amesha Spenta.</p><p>The Ameshas work as a political force to maintain and expand their power. Institutes, bureaus and departments grow and shrink, priests win or lose reputation – it is a constant shadow play that often takes a hard toll on the population.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PHANTOMS IN THE NIGHT</h5><p>The Faceless One has no seat among the Amesha Spenta, instead being represented by the Angra Mainyu, the dreaded secret police, also known as the Phantoms. The Phantoms are above all laws except for a single one – to safeguard the rule of Aremerat. Many dissidents have been dragged from their dinner tables out into the street to be shot before their neighbors, without trial. No one is safe. Everyone is looking over his or her shoulders. No one dares to question the actions of the Phantoms openly.</p><h4>AREMERAT’S CITIZENS</h4><p>Sadaalians generally live strict, humble lives. They work to feed their families. They wear their talismans and thank Aremerat at dawn and dusk for the great civilization he has created. They meet their confessor at least once a week to confess and scrutinize their actions. Moderation guides all things. There are no decadent pleasures available to common people in Sadaal.</p><p>Life on Bahram is somewhat different. Farmers are moving into the big cities to share in the new economy, and a middle class is forming. New districts crop up around shipyards and factories. Bigotry is receding, and the citizens no longer fear change.</p><h4>DAHARAB</h4><p>The Daharab dockyards are the center of Consortium power on Bahram. They are located in the Newlands, a group of islands where foreign companies are allowed to establish themselves. Sections for enormous freighters are constructed in the huge factories of the yards and then taken up into orbit for assembly.</p><p>Daharab is a bustling city. The social strata are much more nuanced here compared to other parts of the planet and the system. There is more money to be made here, but also a lot of people living in actual poverty – something that hardly exists outside of the Newlands. Another indication of the loosening of control in the Newlands is the growing influx of plebeians, drawn here from across the Horizon to work in the factories.</p><h4>THE NAMTAR WINDS</h4><p>On southern Bahram, far from the thriving cities, vast fields of ruins stretch out as far as the eye can see. Before the Portal Wars, this area was home to several cities around the big lakes connecting to the Namtar Sea farther south.</p><p>Because of the so-called Namtar winds, the area has been closed off. Usually, the lakes and the sea are calm, but a few times per year, terrible storms erupt. The winds pick up radioactive dust from the Portal Wars and hurl it in focused hurricanes over the forests, marshlands, and the southern cities.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>CONSORTIUM PRESENCE</h4><p>Many Sadaalians regard the presence of the Consortium on Bahram as an insult – why are they there if not to exploit the system’s natural riches? Naima Thaud, head representative of the Consortium in the system, has employed many learned Icon worshippers and meets regularly with the local clergy in Bahram, carefully building up trust for the faction. Thaud is measured and thoughtful in both word and action, but hopes to drive bigger and bigger wedges between the Ameshas over time.</p></div><h1>ALBURZ</h1><hr /><p>Around the highest plateau in the Shimush Mountains lies Alburz, the capital of Sadaal. The city is carved out of the rock and is an architectural masterpiece. High towers pierce the skies. Broad avenues zigzag between massive ziggurats. Slim bridges span across deep valleys. The sides of the valleys are carved into a myriad of buildings, taking advantage of the cliffs’ natural cool during the hot days. Alburz is a green city – trees line the avenues, much space is devoted to terraced farming and there are wide, lush parks with stunning views of the Shimush. The city also extends deep down into the mountains. Textile factories and refineries for salt, spices, and vegetable oils have been carved out of the dark depths below the city. Alburz is the system’s administrative, spiritual and economic hub. Several districts are devoted solely to bureaus and institutes where scribes and archivists work untiringly around the clock.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>AREMERAT</h5><p>To common people, the leader they watch in the newscasts is the same Aremerat as their spiritual father, the one who rebuilt the Sadaalian civilization after the Portal Wars. The details of the process of choosing an Aremerat are not known, as the only ones who ever meet him are the Amesha Spenta. Some speculate that it is an Amesha who is raised up to become the new Aremerat, while others believe that some unknown technology has extended the life of the original leader. To the population of Sadaal however, the answer is clear: Aremerat is immortal. He is eternal and will never take his hand from his people.</p></div><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/sadaal_stad.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">The crowded city of Daharab on Bahram.</p><p></p><h4>THE OPEN CITY</h4><p>The urban planning of Alburz is as strict as the Sadaalian faith. In its original form, all available space was utilized in the most effective manner and no dead spaces were allowed. This does not mean that the city feels cramped or claustrophobic, however – large, open areas were also considered a good use of space.</p><p>Several institutes are responsible for the planning of the city. They make sure that the city’s original aesthetics are not destroyed by new ideas or constructions. Just opening up a new window in one’s house requires visits to several different offices, and there is an endless series of forms that must be filled out and approved.</p><h4>MASKS AND TRADITION</h4><p>Tradition is the keyword in Sadaalian culture. The past is revered and kept alive. That many in the system are averse to change is not strange.  In the aftermath of the Portal Wars, violent sandstorms swept across Sadaal. The population was forced to wear masks when going outside. This established the mask as a symbol of the rebirth of Sadaalian civilization. Today, skilled mask makers enjoy high praise in society, and even the clergy must humor their whims from time to time.</p><p>Masks have become an indicator of social status on Sadaal. Priests and influential officials in the institutes wear ornate full-face masks in bone, silver or stone, patterned and decorated with precious stones and metals. Lowly foremen wear embroidered fabric masks, while the factory workers wear at most half-face paper masks covering mouth and nose.</p><h4>A THOUSAND TONGUES</h4><p>Zeni is uncommon on Sadaal. The language is growing slowly on Bahram, but the indigenous tongues still dominate in Alburz. Priests and diplomats claim not to understand a word of Zeni and use translators in all meetings with foreigners.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"kxGxFWBxUu5G4vCb","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264818,"modifiedTime":1680376264818,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"FeY4ATaHaKEY4QWw"}

There are ships, space stations and starry vistas, just like in any other space-themed RPG. What separates Coriolis from other sci-fi RPGs is first and foremost the social environment, which in Coriolis is strongly inspired by the Middle East. The unique features of the game are listed below.</p><h5>Arabian nights – in space</h5><p>The Coriolis world is inspired by Middle Eastern culture rather than the Western one. Food, music and fashion, as well as religion, philosophy and literature. Most importantly, myths and folk tales from the Middle East deeply entwine with the spirit of the game world. The Third Horizon is a world where ancient myth meets high technology.</p><h5>The old versus the new</h5><p>A central theme to Coriolis is the conflict between the Firstcome, the Horizon’s earliest settlers, and the Zenithians, descendants to the second wave of colonists arriving onboard the Zenith. Although the Firstcome had already established their culture throughout the Horizon when Zenith arrived, the Zenithians have grown to dominate more and more in the last decades, through trade, hostile expansion and colonization. The Zenithians’ cultural imperialism is a key factor in the conflict between the Consortium – a Zenithian faction – and the Firstcome Order of the Pariah.</p><h5>Mysticism and Icon worship</h5><p>Worship of the Icons permeates everything in the world of Coriolis. The religion is the smallest common denominator for peoples of the Third Horizon. While faith is strongest with the Firstcome, especially so amongst the ranks of the Church of the Icons and the Order of the Pariah, the recently arrived Zenithians have too converted to worshipping the Icons in large numbers. The level of religious commitment varies, from the superstitious hauler crew praying to the Traveler before a portal jump, to missionaries zealously devoted to the holiest of struggles, saving the Horizon one soul at a time.</p><h5>The dark between the stars</h5><p>The omens have foretold it, and the clergy have preached it for a long time now: the Dark between the Stars – the unspeakable, corrupting force at work in the intersection between civilization and the endless nothingness of space – seems to be real. In Coriolis, the Dark between the Stars plays roughly the role of the Devil in Earth’s Christianity.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Three Tips for Inspiration</h5><p>Watching a TV series or reading a book can help you to get into the right mood for an RPG. Here are three quick tips for Coriolis:</p><ul><li>Firefly, the TV series about the crew onboard a small freighter vessel, has a lot in common with Coriolis. Just trade the Western influence for Arabian Nights.</li><li>Revelation Space and its sequels. These books by Alastair Reynolds are full of ancient mysteries and mythical ruins – just like Coriolis.</li><li>Alien, by Ridley Scott. Dark, deep-space horror and retrofuturistic spaceships fit perfectly with the world of Coriolis.</li></ul></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch1/gränder_coriolis.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"y4z5Co7FBP7OiaDV","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265480,"modifiedTime":1680592687068,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hLmLEmsMKNBiOsUN","sort":0,"_id":"FqSbNIv1aLLo0eHZ"}

The PCs are free to choose how they wish to report back to their employer and what evidence to present. If Akouba is alive and hasn’t yet been exposed as an Astûrban agent however, matters are somewhat beyond their control. She arranges an escort out of the Sultra and makes sure that the right evidence finds it way to the Council of Factions, the Judicators and (possibly) judge Nigelia Kurahan. The Bulletin reports around the clock about the brave group that punished those guilty for the kidnappings, and if there were any thrilling heroics involved, the PCs receive a +1 to Reputation.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INTERPRETING THE VISION</h5><p>If the PCs try to find out more about the world they visited in the Emissary’s vision, there is currently not much information to be found:</p><ul><li>A culture test can tell them that there are no known ziggurat temples in the Third Horizon resembling those they saw in the vision.</li><li>A science test can tell them that there are no known green planets orbiting a pair of pale suns. The crops they saw are also unidentifiable.</li><li>A culture test can inform them that the robes worn by the singer are vaguely reminiscent of the ritual robes of the clergy of the Circle of Seekers, but that the hat and shawl look more like those worn by the leaders of the Mogul fleet.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE SECOND HORIZON</h4><p>The PCs have seen a vision of the Second Horizon and its golden world, Argonnas. The singer in the field was Urni en-Argonnas, a mystic from the highest ranks of the Symmetry known as a Santulan – “They who balance the universe”. Five of these spiritual leaders managed to transport their minds to the Third Horizon using an ancient mystic power called resonance, originally discovered after the Portal Wars by the Symmetry’s chief mystic, Rima en-Aldaan. The five mystics inserted their minds into a group of explorers that had crash  landed on Xene, and used their incredible powers to keep their new host bodies alive during their escape from the depths of the gas giant. Urni is the mystic whose vessel would become known as Nabi-mu-Qad, the Messenger Emissary. None of this is for the eyes of the players of course, but it will feature more prominently in future installations of the Mercy campaign. In the meantime, it is enough if the players begin to realize that their story is much more complex than it first appeared.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/fjäril_L.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"GhkDZoFDTMBpZcF4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297291,"modifiedTime":1682695297291,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"YOMfroAUYC191oYi","sort":0,"_id":"GExhgxdoVAN0cMSX"}

The scenario is a standalone prologue to the Mercy of the Icons campaign, and will introduce characters that return later on, but playing through it before starting the campaign is not required. The scenario is linked to several important events in the history of the Third Horizon (page 180 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[07 - History of the Horizon]), and the PCs may become a vital part of the cluster’s future if they play their cards right. The three acts below describe a chain of events starting with the catastrophic engine failure of the Ghazali, plus a description of the Hamura system and the Hamurabi portal station, the place they will most likely head for after making it off the doomed liner.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/introduction/GHAZALI4.webp\" /></div><h4>BACKGROUND</h4><p>A desperate and fragmentary distress call reaches Coriolis, coming from a colony on the gas giant Taoan. The Tsurabi gas mine, partly submerged in the planet’s thick atmosphere, is in desperate need of assistance, but for unknown reasons. The Colonial Agency is the primary owner of the colony and quickly scrambles a rescue fleet to try and evacuate the colonists and salvage the precious mining equipment. The fleet is focused on a decommissioned luxury liner called the Ghazali, which is rapidly upgraded to hold five hundred stasis units – enough for both the two hundred rescue workers and the staff of the Tsurabi, should they need extraction. Many smaller ships accompany the Ghazali, as the Agency has promised handsome rewards to all skippers who sign up for the mission. The smaller vessels dock with the mothership and their crews are put on ice aboard the Ghazali. The Legion supplies an escort in the form of a destroyer, the Zafirah. The rescue mission’s first jump is successful, but the second ends in disaster.</p><p>The Zafirah enters the portal field to Taoan, but something happens shortly thereafter. Enormous amounts of energy are released from the portal and the Ghazali is bathed in hard radiation, which immediately kills the jump crew performing the final checks before going back on ice for the jump. The liner’s engines are destroyed and the ship computer is damaged. The blast from the portal knocks the ship off course and it begins to accelerate toward the strongest gravitational pull in the system – the Hamura star. Most of the smaller vessels docked on the hull of the ship are blown away by the detonation, and the majority of the ships waiting to jump after the Ghazali are also destroyed. The options for escaping the dying titan are suddenly very limited. Shortly after the detonation, the backup systems for the central computer kick in, and all remaining crew are brought out of stasis. The scenario begins as the PCs wake from their dreamless hyper sleep and realize that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TIMELINE</h5><p>If you want to use The Last Voyage of the Ghazali as a prologue to the Mercy of the Icons campaign, you might find the following timeline useful. You are of course free to alter it however you like.</p><ul><li><strong>The Ghosts from Xene</strong>: In CC 60, in the segment of the Traveler, the Emissaries arrive in the Kua system.</li><li><strong>The Judge</strong>: During the Cyclade celebrations, the Bulletin transmits a special broadcast from the Foundation’s research station at Xene, where one of the five mysterious Emissaries has declared itself the Judge incarnate.</li><li><strong>The Messenger</strong>: The following day – the first day of the new year – another Emissary arrives at Coriolis in a Foundation cruiser escorted by two Legion battleships. The Governor of Coriolis makes a statement welcoming the Emissary to the Council of Factions, and it soon becomes known as the Messenger Emissary.</li><li><strong>The Mystics' Disease</strong>: Soon after the arrival of the Emissaries, individuals all across the Third Horizon begin manifesting supernatural powers leading to persecution and religious hatred. Many of these so-called “new mystics” travel to Coriolis for protection, and to be closer to the Messenger Emissary, or to the Foundation’s Xene station to meet the Judge Emissary.</li><li><strong>The Taoan Incident</strong>: After a mining colony transmits a distress call to Coriolis in the segment of the Gambler in CC 61, a rescue fleet focused on the Ghazali passenger liner and the Legion’s Zafirah destroyer departs the station for the Taoan system. The first suite of scenarios in the Mercy campaign begins in the fall of CC 61, for example, around the Cyclade celebrations and the segment of the Faceless One.</li></ul><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>When the scenario begins, the PCs wake up onboard the Ghazali liner as it is slowly but steadily falling into the nearby Hamura star. The theme of the scenario is survival, and the PCs’ goal is to find a way off the doomed ship. First, they must figure out what is going on (Act I) and what they need to do before they can escape (Act II). The turning point comes when the ship’s computer suddenly informs the PCs that the Ghazali’s reactor is about to suffer a meltdown, and their timetable becomes dangerously short. Act III deals with the tumultuous escape from the Ghazali and the subsequent search for other passengers that have made it off the cruiser in escape pods. Over the course of the scenario, the PCs must deal with panicking passengers, high levels of radiation, and escaped, bloodthirsty nekatra, as the consuming flames of the Hamura star draw ever closer outside the windows.</p><p>Surrounded by danger, the PCs must find a way to reach surviving rescue workers that have been trapped in other parts of the ship, organize the evacuation, and salvage the emerald disc from the main computer that contains the answers to what actually happened before the jump to Taoan. The likely destination for the escapees is the Hamurabi portal station, and this is where the aftermath of the scenario takes place. Ideally, the PCs can drop off the rest of the survivors there, share their story with the Bulletin, sell the emerald disc, and reap the rewards of their heroic handling of the situation. The scenario ends when the PCs prepare for the jump back to Kua. They have likely established themselves as trustworthy and resourceful – traits highly sought-after in the Horizon – and things appear to be looking up for them. However, powerful events have been set in motion behind the scenes, and the Third Horizon’s darkest hour is fast approaching – the trials and tribulations of your PCs have only just begun.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE GHAZALI</h5><p>The Ghazali cruise liner was once a beautiful ship, tastefully furnished with mosaic walls and floors, draperies on the walls, and colorful embroidery on the furniture. Despite its huge size, it was only designed to carry three hundred passengers – the wealthiest of the wealthy, traveling the void in luxurious splendor. Today, everything is worn – tears and burns cover the furniture, profane graffiti the mosaics. On the lower decks, everything is simple and crude, made from metal and rubber, and dark, dirty, and decrepit. Despite years of neglect, the Ghazali is more or less functional – a testament to the quality of the work of the Alkarra docks that constructed the ship some thirty cycles ago.</p><p>The liner had been taken out of service and was rusting in a dockyard when the distress call reached Coriolis. The owners, Exeter, were leaning toward scrapping the ship and selling it for parts rather than spending the fortune required to repair and modernize it. The Ghazali was already singing its swan song when its fate was sealed by the Colonial Agency, who swiftly purchased it for their rescue mission to Taoan. The worn-out furniture was cleared out and replaced by stasis beds stacked on top of each other, covering the mosaics and the hand-woven draperies. Starlight shining through the rose tinted windows now falls on crates of stasis fluid rather than on silk sheets. To the ship’s original three hundred beds were added another two hundred, to make room for the Tsurabi crew if they had to be evacuated. Vehicles, exos, and a huge amount of other gear was brought along in the hopes that whatever had happened to the colony could be repaired on site, at least temporarily. The Colonial Agency doesn’t abandon their colonies unless all other options have failed, as it makes future recruitment that much harder.</p><p>The Ghazali is a huge vessel, and much of it is left up to you as the GM to describe to the PCs, depending on which areas they pass through (although you could, for example, describe the less important parts only briefly as the group passes through on their way to more interesting areas). The PCs will mainly use corridors or elevators when getting around. The elevator cars themselves are unreliable, and the PCs may have to climb the shafts in some areas. As a general rule, the higher decks are in better condition, and packed full of supplies and spare parts for the mining machinery. The air is dry, and more or less free from unpleasant smells. The lower decks lack any kind of decorations, and have been crammed full of stasis beds. The different areas of the liner can be seen on page 6. In the center of this booklet, you will find a floor plan of the ship that can be shown to the players to help them find their way.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/introduction/ghazalis_blueprint_small.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HAMURA SYSTEM</h5><p>The scenario takes place in the Hamura system, a system between Kua – where the expedition sets out from – and Taoan, its destination. @JournalEntry[The Hamura System] is described on page 52.</p><h4>MAIN CHARACTERS</h4><p>Most of the survivors onboard the Ghazali are frightened rescue workers, suffering the effects of varying degrees of radiation poisoning. There are, however, a few individuals that are strong enough to step up and challenge decisions made by the PCs that they find immoral or questionable. These are described briefly in Table 1, and in their respective scenes.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 1 CHARACTERS AND MOTIVATIONS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>NAME</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Khomina</td><td>Mystic with a vision</td><td>Getting the rest of the survivors to give up and accept their fate</td></tr><tr><td>Brother Ramas</td><td>Samaritan Fanatic</td><td>Helping the righteous among the survivors in any way he can</td></tr><tr><td>Komoro Vai</td><td>Selfish Leader</td><td>Leading the evacuation to ensure his own safety</td></tr><tr><td>Sabetha Pour</td><td>Smuggler</td><td>Saving her contraband and herself</td></tr><tr><td>Koria Yohares</td><td>Informal Leader</td><td>Helping the PCs with the evacuation (if they rescue him from the chapel)</td></tr><tr><td>Zhasai</td><td>Nekatra Alpha</td><td>Saving her pack from death onboard the Ghazali</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE PCS’ SHIP</h5><p>Before the jump from Kua, the captain of the Ghazali, Ia Kaschares, ordered all smaller vessels in the fleet to dock with the liner and shut off their reactors to keep traffic around the Ghazali to a minimum. The crews of the vessels were assigned stasis beds on the Ghazali for the journey. When the detonation in the portal to Taoan occurred, many of the docked ships were destroyed, but the PCs’ ship has likely survived with only minimal damage. A description of the free trader vessel Fatima’s Bounty in included on page 50 @JournalEntry[The Escape Vessel]. It might come in handy as an escape ship if the PCs are without a ship of their own for some reason.</p></div><h4>FACTIONS AND GROUPS</h4><p>The Last Voyage of the Ghazali is a high octane race against time, with little room for political intrigue. Some of the NPCs in the scenario are affiliated with the factions of the Third Horizon, but the desperate situation means everyone prioritizes survival over ideology. The exception here is Samaritan Brother Ramas, from the Order of the Pariah. He is zealously devoted to the Zalosian way, and will act accordingly, no matter the cost.</p><p>The rescue mission is organized and funded by the Colonial Agency, which, by extension, means the Consortium. Saving lives and valuable data from the Ghazali will be rewarded by the faction, and actions to the contrary will be punished.</p><h4>BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h4><p>This section contains tips and ideas that might come in handy regardless of whether you use the doomed ship as a setting for a tweaked version of the scenario or play it strictly by the book. The floor plan at the back will help you guide the group through the dangers ahead.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 1</h5><p>The PCs wake up in their stasis chamber and work their way through the ship, trying to find out what has happened. The scenes in Act I are open-ended, and can be played in any order between the starting scene and the encounter with the ship’s confused central computer, Suleiman. Darkness Points can be used to put obstacles and dangers in the path of the group.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 2</h5><p>The hub of Act II is @JournalEntry[The Medlab] (page 19) where several key scenes take place. From there, the PCs can head out to explore other important areas – the escape ship, the bridge, the chapel, and possibly the cargo hold.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 3</h5><p>The Ghazali’s reactor eventually fails and heads for a meltdown. It is time to say goodbye to the doomed liner and escape as quickly as possible.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> MAPS</h5><p>The maps that accompany the different scene descriptions can be useful to give your group a better sense of what their surroundings look like. You are of course free to change the location of a scene, and use a different map.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>MAPS AND TIME</h4><p>The picture of the Ghazali in the back should be carefully removed from the book when you begin play and shown to the players. Keep it face up so the players can’t see the floor plan on the back. When they find the functional terminal at the end of Act I (see the Status Report event), flip it over to show them the map. Place the EP tokens on the timeline on the map, and consult the Keeping Track of Time section.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> KEEPING TRACK OF TIME</h5><p>The main themes of the scenario are urgency and desperation. When the PCs interact with Suleiman – the ship’s computer – they realize that they have only eighteen hours to plan and carry out their escape. This estimate is, however, false; the reactor is quickly failing and when its impending meltdown becomes unavoidable, Suleiman updates the timeframe, giving the PCs only 57 minutes to escape! After the scene when the group is first informed of the eighteen hours, you have two alternate ways of keeping track of time as the GM: you can either make a rough estimate of how much time passes and play the Panic! event after ten hours – or whenever it feels dramatically appropriate – regardless of how far along in their escape plan the PCs are, or you can use a slightly more detailed method, measuring time by the number of scenes played.</p><p>Each scene should take about one hour to complete, including all the relevant skill checks. When the PCs are informed about the remaining eighteen hours, take the Energy Point tokens (18 pcs) from the game box and find the map of the Ghazali in the back of this book. Place the EP tokens on the circles along the upper and lower edges of the map and remove one for each hour/scene that passes. This should help you establish a sense of urgency and stress as the group becomes painfully aware of how little time they have left. You can let the outcome of certain skill checks shorten or lengthen the time necessary to complete a scene. A critical success can, for example, cut the time necessary for the scene in half, while a failure still gets the job done, but takes double the time.</p><p>After the Panic! scene, each EP token represents ten minutes. Remove all but six tokens from the timeline when the Panic! scene begins – the PCs must now escape the Ghazali as quickly as possible!</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RADIATION</h5><p>Just as the Ghazali was preparing to jump to Taoan, it was flooded with a massive burst of hard radiation that immediately killed the jump crew and wounded many of the passengers in stasis. When the PCs wake up, many areas are still heavily irradiated – see the map on page 6 – but the radiation levels in a damaged area can vary as you see fit. The rules for radiation poisoning can be found on page 99 in the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]. As radiation is invisible to the naked eye, spotting a dangerous area can be hard. Have the group test survival. If they succeed, they figure out the radiation level of the area ahead before entering it. The proper equipment will give them bonus dice to roll – an environmental scanner gives a +2 for example. When exposed to radiation, their gear can also help – a protective mask or a survival mask gives them an armor rating of 1 or 2, respectively, against radiation. Armor or suits with the ‘Vacuum suit’ feature protect against all radiation.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE GROUP</h5><p>Why are the PCs aboard the Ghazali? They have signed up for the rescue mission to Tsurabi, and have been promised a substantial amount of money on return, but it may not be their only motivation. Their patron and a wide range of ulterior motives dressed up as heroism could help explain why they are here. Another important question regards their willingness to remain onboard the liner after an escape route has been identified. Will they save themselves as quickly as possible, or risk death to help out their fellow passengers? An important factor to consider is that their own ship’s computer is undergoing a lengthy reconfiguration (exactly how lengthy is up to the GM to decide). This may force them to explore other escape routes rather than just running to their ship as soon as they wake. Fatima’s Bounty is an alternative way to safety, but the competition for space aboard the ship will quickly become fierce.</p><p>As the GM, you can use DP to challenge the PCs and force them to remain on the Ghazali – for example, deciding that Fatima’s Bounty has to undergo reconfiguration just like the PCs’ ship. If the group figures out some incredibly clever way to escape immediately, however – let them. They will live to fight another day but will have to carry the burden of having left the rest of the survivors to die. Such a choice could have interesting consequences in the future. Maybe the group become wanted by the law for their cowardice, hounded by Bulletin correspondents, or tracked by shady faction investigators examining the fate of the rescue mission. A GM with a mean streak could even decide that the official blame for the incident is put on the PCs. Regardless, if they escape without trying to save the rest of the survivors, it should generate a substantial amount of DP. Below is a list of suggested reasons for different groups to have joined the rescue mission:</p><p><strong>Free traders</strong>: Many companies have invested heavily in the operation for their reputations’ sake, and will want to send representatives along to monitor their investments. The group might also have been hired by their patron to protect or salvage an important investment on the Tsurabi colony.</p><p><strong>Mercenaries</strong>: The fact that the Legion supplies an escort confirms that the Agency suspects danger on arrival in Taoan. Besides being trained in combat, mercenaries are also used to following orders, and that quality will likely come in handy at the destination, even if there is no one to fight.</p><p><strong>Explorers</strong>: Explorers are always welcome on operations such as this one. Their motivations for participating can vary – birr, fame, or previous connections to Taoan. If a PC has Taoan origins, it is not unlikely that fear for the safety of friends or relatives plays a part in their decision to participate in the mission. The fate of the Tsurabi colony is also breaking news for the Bulletin. Both official correspondents and freelancers flock to the Ghazali to be close to the action. Traveling with the rescue workers will provide a poignant portrait of modern heroism, but many of the journalists would probably prefer to dine with the captain and observe the operation from the bridge. You can’t always get what you want, however.</p><p><strong>Agents</strong>: Many groups and factions are interested in finding out what actually happened in Taoan. Since the Portal Wars, losing contact with colonies of this size has been rare. Consortium agents onboard are more or less open about their affiliation, but other factions have reasons to remain more discreet. The Hegemony are always keen on keeping up with the Consortium, and several of the Firstcome factions may find it useful to send spies along to gather data. The Colonial Agency might also have hired infiltrators to pose as rescue workers to keep an eye on the involvement of other parties.</p><p><strong>Pilgrims</strong>: Both the crew of the Ghazali and the Tsurabians will undoubtedly have need of Iconic guidance, so what better to bring along than good old guardians of the faith? The group could have been ordered to take part in the mission by their spiritual leader or guide.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/introduction/upp i skeppet03.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"znDw4uCrIfqu9McI","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252583,"modifiedTime":1680376252583,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"gl3Ac1s0CwGHuhXI","sort":0,"_id":"GXyP9wVaREP4lK5F"}

As the GM, you should be well prepared for this scene and be ready to improvise to make sure the group find answers that point toward the Sanatorium and the martyr strike team. At least one clue from each category should be in the PCs' possession before they visit the Sanatorium and meet Brother Ramas.

Enormous holo screens cover the ceiling and walls, projecting the view of the sun-drenched jungles and the delta around the Conglomerate as seen from the top of the Monolith, complete with a small dot – the Coriolis station – in the sky high above. The hegemony’s revered locale is meant to be perceived as the highest point, on Kua as well as the Coriolis station. The building at the heart of the Therr is a revelation and blasphemy at the same time – its eight towers rise twenty meters into the air, reaching almost all the way up the screens, reminding visitors of the Zenithian legend of the Therr-Aybbalon, the monolith on Ardha smitten by the gods for its masters' hubris a long, long time ago.</p><p>The whitewashed palace is crowned by a sky blue dome with eight Icon towers placed octagonally around it. The geometric perfection between the dome and the octagon and the ratio between the towers and the dome demands respect even from Dabaran architects. Small jungle oases with Kuan flora surround the palace and special ED fields keep temperature and humidity high.</p><p>The entrance to the palace lies at the top of thirty-meter-wide staircase made from white Kuan marble. The dimensions of the stairs are a bit over-the-top, both because they are on a space station and because of the tremendous amount of birr it cost to transport all the marble up from Kua. Visitors are greeted by palace guards from the so-called peacock troops, guarding the gates. Underneath their garish uniforms, the guards are all business, equipped with the latest in acc tech and advanced heavy armor. The large audience hall behind the security corridor is a deep, open room with high ceilings, paintings and mosaics on the walls, and fancifully fashioned flowerbeds containing the Kuan jungles' most beautiful flora. Meetings are usually held in small alcoves in the walls where visitors are treated to comfortable divans around small, round tables and served anything from steaming kawah to chilled honey wines by master courtesans. Special guests are sometimes brought in to see the inner parts of the palace through winding corridors and staircases and up into the Icon towers (as in the Captain’s Orders event below). When the PCs visit the palace, they are greeted by court hostess Vivera:</p><ul><li><strong>Vivera Ariadnes (Court Hostess)</strong>: One way to hone one’s diplomatic skills is to serve as court hostess at one of the Hegemony’s many consulates or embassies – usually called palaces. Vivera is relatively new in her position, but makes up for it by being from an excellent bloodline. She wears classical makeup and ties her hair in a high knot as per the fashion in the Monolith, with a veil on top covered in her family’s patterns and glyphs. She is always polite, smiling, and interested when greeting new people, while at the same time subtly pumping them for information to pass on to the delegate or dignitary they have come to meet.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HULL OF THE SPIRE</h5><p>Despite many attempts to hide the duralite beams, oxygen regulators, and air pumps, some aspects of the station’s life support systems are still visible along the outer walls of the Abhrra. Along the edges of the park, behind low walls and hidden behind floral arrangements, one can find control panels and hatches leading to service points along the power and irrigation grids, maintenance shafts, trash chutes, and vents. In here, the workings of the station’s internal organs produce a constant buzz and the framework of the hull groans under the pressure of the grav projectors. The corridors are warm and humid and everything is covered in some unnameable greenish grey film – probably algae, or some strange form of fungus.</p><p>This is the path used by the martyr warriors as they exited the Abhrra carrying the sedated Emissary. Through dark shafts and via ladders, they slowly descended through the outer walls of the Core, continuing to the Sanatorium and eventually the Cellar.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SANATORIUM</h5><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/Sanatoriet2.webp\" /></div><p>The Sanatorium is briefly described on page 264 @JournalEntry[The Core] in the Coriolis Core Rulebook. It is located in the Core, opposite the Infotheca, just a short walk from the Student and University districts. When entering the main gate, one find oneself in a large foyer where one must state one’s business to be allowed further into the building. The marble floors, white walls, and high, arched ceilings give the place an atmosphere of peace and purity, which is further aided by the hospitable Samaritan staff.</p><p>Two archways lead from the first hall to the courtyard, surrounded by the open galleries and balconies of the higher floors. The courtyard is a beautiful place of peace, with green, flowing hills and serpentine mosaic paths in blue and white – a place of rest and meditation where one’s heart can heal and where the air is easier to breath than anywhere else in the Core. There are several low, white buildings in the courtyard, made from Kuan clay. They contain the Samaritans' lodgings, several treatment centers, and a central chapel devoted to the Martyr. Stairs connect the courtyard with the upper floors as well as with the basement levels. When the PCs visit the Sanatorium, they will meet Sister Robwah, Brother Ramas and a few of the establishment’s current patients:</p><ul><li><strong>Sana Tohrm (Mystic)</strong>: Near the door in the foyer stands a young woman with golden brown skin and Zenithian gold makeup on her forehead. Her hair is long and tightly knotted high on her head. Her knee-length, freshly ironed kameez held together by a simple Algolan silk shawl makes it obvious that she comes from money. She fingers nervously a tabula of the kind usually given to students at the Bulletin’s Lyceum of Propaganda. About a week ago, she was contacted by a young man (Aram Yafa), who told her to seek treatment for her issues at the Sanatorium, but now she is getting cold feet. Her mystic powers, which are only in the early stages of manifestation, give her short flashes of future events, and it is one such flash, full of pain and anxiety, that causes her to hesitate. When the PCs encounter her here, she is very insecure about what to do next.</li><li><strong>Brother Jarmis (Samaritan)</strong>: Young Brother Jarmis is a quiet, kind man who works in the reception at the Sanatorium. He refuses to speak about any of the “guests” with strangers or call for Brother Ramas if the PCs ask about him. After some persuasion or outright threats, he will summon his stern supervisor, Sister Robwah. His reluctance to call for Brother Ramas is due to the fact that Ramas is in the middle of operating on the two shot martyr warriors when the PCs arrive.</li><li><strong>Melko Iamas (Patient)</strong>: “Part of the furniture” is how Melko describes himself – he has been treated here for several cycles for a bad case of lung mold after a visit to the Dabaran spore deserts, which – although not transmittable – has proven hard to cure. Between coughing spells and breathing into his nebulizer, the curious and bored mister Iamas is more than willing to talk to anyone visiting the Sanatorium – if they can bear to listen to him. He knows most things that go on in the open areas of the complex.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INVESTIGATING THE DIFFERENT LEADS</h5><p>Below are a few examples of locations and methods to visit or use when looking for answers to some of the complex questions posed by the intricate case so far. The locations and their accompanying events can of course be switched out or improvised instead:</p><ul><li><strong>The Data Meme</strong>: Apart from the evidence pointing at ambassador Quasar, the PCs could also choose to analyze the meme used to disable the Emissary’s security protocols. Using a tabula, the PCs could do this themselves by passing a data djinn test at –2, or at –1 if they use a ship computer. They could also pay Karoum, the old ship mechanic outside of Al-Said’s, 500 birr to help them, or ask judge Kurahan who can make sure the analyses are performed (in this case, Akouba will forward the results to the PCs after about a day).</li><li><strong>Blood Analysis</strong>: The bio code analysis of the blood splatter at the Emissary’s residence reveals that the DNA from five of the individuals present indicates that they were from Zalos, home system of the Order of the Pariah. It belongs to three males and two females and these persons are treated as the main suspects in the official investigation. The last DNA profile (from the hand print on the prayer rug) reads as Miran blood, but with an incredible regenerative rate – many times that of the Krahin humanites from Marfik, known for their fast healing, or any of the bionic sculpts available in the Horizon. The bio data seems partially corrupt and it cannot be determined whether the code is male or female.</li><li><strong>Damaged Apartment</strong>: Judicator Akouba, or even spy chief Lenove Astir, can tell the PCs that the damage to the mosaic on the wall seems to come from a Vulcan carbine and that the torn books have been cut with an activated dura knife. The PCs can figure this out for themselves by passing a command test, or observation at –1. The arms dealers on the Ozone Plaza, or one of criminal street gangs, could also provide them with the info if they have enough birr or the right contacts,</li><li><strong>The Vulcan Round</strong>: The recovered Vulcan round can be examined at the Judcators' forensics lab, or the PCs could do it themselves using science. Alternatively, they could ask a gunsmith on the Ozone Plaza. The details revealed by an examination are that the round is soundless, has been hand-made from a duramite/copper alloy, and that none of the Zenithian companies or factions manufacture ammunition like this. It is used extensively by terrorists and rebels, however. The tests also show that the round has been deformed mid-flight: one of its sides has been flattened and it has been pushed off course to hit the mosaic instead of its intended target. (As the GM, you know that this was caused by the Emissary’s mystic powers pushing the rounds away). The round has been deformed twice – first lengthwise by a shock wave and then frontally when hitting the mosaic.</li><li><strong>Smuggling</strong>: The PCs might start suspecting that this is an advanced operation that would have required a lot of illegal gear to pull off, which might lead them to ask around with the Birbasils' foot soldiers in the Lama gang. The Lama controls the Ozone Plaza and the smuggling of much of the station’s unregistered firearms. The PCs could also ask around in the Stevedore Central. Using the proper contacts or after passing a hard (–2) manipulation test, the PCs eventually find out that the gear and weapons they are asking about have been smuggled onboard during the last segment. If they scored an extra six on the roll, they will also find out that the objects were brought onboard and then put into boxes containing medical supplies. After the Consortium, the Samaritans are the largest importers of medical supplies on the station. A Critical success tells them that the operation was handled by a Sadaalian mercenary – Dara Hirsha. She has made a career of moving illegal goods between Kua and the Coriolis station, mainly with the help of her connections within the Syndicate and the Lama gang. (The GM should know that she has been the contractor handling all transportation for the Warriors of the Holy Light and additional clues may appear in the second adventure –The Kuan Connection.)</li><li><strong>The Four Bowls</strong>: To crack the mystery of the Emissary’s strange prayer customs, the PCs would be wise to seek the help of a Firstcome faction or cult such as Ahlam’s Temple, the Church of the Icons, or the Circle of Seekers. The clergy of these groups can all tell them about the theory of the four stages, but their individual explanations will be heavily influenced by the traditions of their respective group (see The Four Transformations on page 46 @JournalEntry[02 - The Emissary's Last Song]). None of them can give the PCs any information about the faith of the Emissaries, but they can all spot the similarities with several mystic traditions in the Third Horizon.</li><li><strong>The Books</strong>: Examining the books at the Emissary’s residence reveals that they cover all the known systems in the Third Horizon, as well as some things introduced by the arrival of the Zenith</li></ul><h4>NPCS</h4><p>This scene introduces several members of the Zenithian Hegemony as well as from the Order of the Pariah that may return in later scenarios within the Mercy campaign.</p>@Actor[Johar Quassar]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/johar_quassar_full.webp\" /></div>@Actor[Lenove Astir]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/lenove_astir_full.webp\" /></div>@Actor[Robwah]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/robwah_full.webp\" /></div>@Actor[Brother Ramas]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/ramas_full.webp\" /></div><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>In this open scene, the associated events are like tiny scenes themselves. Examination of clues found in earlier scenes and events is left up to you as the GM to improvise.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CAPTAIN’S ORDERS</h5><p>There are several ways to acquire an audience with ambassador Johar Quassar. The PCs could ask judge Kurahan for help, use the Faction Standing talent if they have it, or simply turn up at the embassy and state their business at the reception. Either way, they will be granted a meeting, but only after waiting a long time in a foyer outside. Judicator Akouba will not be allowed to participate in the meeting. They will eventually be called upon and taken to an audience chamber at the top of one of the Icon towers of the palace. Here, they will have the opportunity to speak freely and off-the-record with the ambassador who – given the circumstances – is surprisingly eager to help.</p><p>The room where ambassador Quassar receives you is exquisitely furnished, with dark draperies covering the walls. There are servants in black robes posted around the chamber, almost invisible against the dark background. Each of them carries a small ornate pot containing a jungle vine whose red petals match the servants' makeup, a red line running from forehead to chin. The holo screen above you projects the night sky over the Monolith. The ambassador sits on a crimson divan at the back of the room, bathed in starlight but shadowed by a dark figure standing behind him.</p><p>The audience begins as the PCs sit down on cushions on the floor before the ambassador’s throne. The servants place their jungle vines on hidden shelves in the walls and serve the group Kuan fruits and nuts, small pastries, and sweet, hot wine, after which they return to their posts. A knowledgeable PC (culture) will identify the vines as pelicosa armantum, a poisonous plant with razor-sharp leaves – even the smallest cut can be fatal. The servants obviously carry these lethal burdens as a display of the ambassador’s power.<br />When the meeting starts, the dark figure behind the throne steps out into the light and introduces herself as Lenove Astir, cultural attaché, after which she returns to the shadows and remains silent for the rest of the audience, although she occasionally whispers something in the ambassador’s ear. The talent Faction Standing: The Zenithian Hegemony/The Consortium or a successful culture test will tell the PCs that the Astir clan belongs to the hegemonist wing within the faction.</p><ul><li><strong>The Meeting</strong>: The ambassador confirms that he met with the Emissary on his father’s orders, but cannot divulge the exact nature of the meeting.</li><li><strong>The Security System</strong>: The security systems and locks were all functional when the ambassador arrived. Using manipulation or the Judge of Character talent, the PCs will note that the ambassador seems nervous, especially when talking about the security systems.</li><li><strong>The Threats</strong>: After some persuasive questions from the PCs and discreet whispers from cultural attaché Astir, the ambassador confesses to having deactivated the alarms using a tag given to him by an agent who approached him at Alkamaar’s, but that he acted under duress as the agent had threatened his family. Using manipulation, mystic powers, or Judge of Character, the PCs can spot that he appears to be lying regarding the details of his confession. Ambassador Quassar is actually trying to point them in the direction of the martyr strike team – no threats against him have been made. When pressured for information, he describes the agent who threatened him as one of the waiters at the restaurant, but with a shaved face and head. The Hegemony’s agents have not been able to identify or track down the waiter afterwards.</li><li><strong>The Tag</strong>: If they ask for it, the PCs will be given the tag in question. It is of the anonymous sort that can be purchased on every street corner on the Ring. The software – which requires a successful data djinn test and a few hours of work to analyze – is a meme with sophisticated spy and kill code capable of deactivating security systems. The code signature looks like that of the Order of the Pariah. The PCs might already have extracted this information from the Emissary’s residence, in which case they will see that the data meme on the tag is identical with the one at the apartment.</li><li><strong>The Order</strong>: The ambassador cannot tell them anything about the Order of the Pariah outside of common knowledge – the only known members on the station are the Samaritans at the Sanatorium in the Core.</li></ul><p>After the meeting, the PCs will have clues implicating the Order and the Sanatorium in the conspiracy. If you played The Last Voyage of the Ghazali, they might already have a contact at the Sanatorium, Brother Ramas. The Hegemony’s plans to put the blame on the Order are set in motion, but the PCs might have sensed that the ambassador was lying about something.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RENDEVOUZ WITH RAMAS</h5><p>The PCs might visit the Sanatorium to look for Noor, or they might be here following up the leads given to them by ambassador Quassar. Whenever they arrive, they soon discover that getting answers or a meeting with someone is easier said than done. Brother Jarmis at the front desk is friendly, but adamant in his refusal to speak about any of the “guests” with strangers or call Brother Ramas if the PCs ask for him. His unwillingness to call for Brother Ramas is due to the fact that the wavering Samaritan is currently operating on the two martyr warriors that got shot during the attack on the Emissary.</p><p>Using manipulation, the PCs could get Jarmis to call on his supervisor, Sister Robwah. Although stern in appearance, Sister Robwah can quite easily be persuaded to give them the information below or to call Ramas (manipulation +1). When Ramas arrives, he nods silently to the PCs if they met before on the Ghazali, otherwise he makes a more formal introduction. Sister Robwah remains present for the conversation, which can provide the group with the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>The Mystics:</strong> The Samaritans take care of several victims of the mystic’s disease. Their names are of course kept secret due to the Samaritan’s oath, and their medical records are not shared with anyone outside the Sanatorium, but if the PCs apply some additional pressure, or go as far as threats, Brother Ramas will make an exception.</li><li><strong>Noor’s Symptoms</strong>: Noor sought out the Sanatorium after suffering from sleep deprivation and strange visions. Brother Ramas was treating Noor and appears genuinely sad to hear that ne is missing.</li><li><strong>Conversations with Noor</strong>: The topics discussed during their treatment sessions were mainly existential, concerning the Icons, fate, and being chosen. Noor became increasingly convinced that ne had been chosen by the Icons – and the Martyr specifically – to perform great deeds. culture or a relevant background will tell the PCs that the Martyr is the name given to the Judge Icon by the Order of the Pariah.</li><li><strong>The Last Visit</strong>: Noor was supposed to have shown up for an appointment about a week ago, but never came – instead, ne passed through the Sanatorium in the hands of nirs captors on the way to the Cellar. Both Ramas and Robwah are aware of this.<br />When the conversation is over, the Samaritans will bid the PCs a hasty farewell.</li><li><strong>The Message</strong>: Brother Ramas will shake hands with the PCs and discreetly pass a small personal communicator to them while doing it. He  seems nervous and is very careful not to let Sister Robwah see the hand-over.  The device is pre-programmed with Ramas communications code. The PCs can then try to contact Brother Ramas but will not succeed until just before the A Dance of Blood scene. Until then, a neutral voice at the other end will inform them that the person they are trying to reach is unavailable and will get back to them at their earliest convenience.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A DANGEROUS CLIMB</h5><p>If the PCs try to figure out how the martyr warriors exited the Abhrra without being seen, this will take them into the slimy vents inside the hull:</p><ul><li><strong>Following the Blood</strong>: If someone in the group has a talent that allows her to find the kidnappers' tracks (or if someone passes an observation test at –2), they will find the warriors' escape route – through the damp maintenance shafts in the hull of the station. The tracks end by a service hatch in the core, straight into the Sanatorium’s lower levels.</li><li><strong>A Martyred Warrior</strong>: If the PCs pass the initial observation test with more than one six, you could let them find the dead warrior. The climb down was very difficult for the warriors and in one of the more hazardous shafts, the group dropped their dead brother. The body fell to the bottom and was torn apart by a fan. Temporarily disabling the fan to get to the remains requires a successful technology test.</li><li><strong>A Difficult Descent</strong>: The PCs might need to test dexterity when climbing down the narrow, slippery chutes. If they have climbing equipment, exos, or some equivalent gear, no tests are needed.</li><li><strong>A Lethal Draft</strong>: At the cost of 2 DP, you could have the vent system perform routine cleaning with the PCs still inside. This means that shaft is closed off and opened to space. This has the same effects as an explosive decompression, pulling the PCs out through the vent hatch and into space. After two turns, the hatch is closed again and the system turns back online, with a lot less algae dregs and trash (and PCs) to block the airflow.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0, 2 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXPLOSIVE DECOMPRESSION</h4><p>When the chute is vented, all loose objects are pulled toward the opening. If you want to move during the venting, you must first pass a hard (–2) DEXTERITY test. If you just want to grab onto something for dear life, test FORCE at –1. Both tests count as a slow action (3 APs). If you wear an exo, both tests are unmodified instead. A critical success is required to help someone else as well, or to save a loose object (within Close range if you test FORCE or Short range if you test DEXTERITY). These rules can also be used if the hull is breached during space combat or a violent firefight near the hull of a ship (for example during the attack on the martyr strike team’s base in Act 3).</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>FOLLOWING THE MARTYRS</h5><p>At the Sanatorium, the PCs can follow the blood trail to one of Brother Ramas’ operating rooms, but also onwards down into the Cellar (as the strike team splits up). This is achieved by a successful roll of OBSERVATION at –1. (As a GM you can now decide if you want to skip ahead and go straight to Act 3 on page 63 @JournalEntry[00 - The Abyss]. If the PCs have enough evidence or feel pressured for time it may be better to just keep up the pace.)</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BREAKING NEWS</h5><p>This event can be used at any point during Act 2. The PCs see a newscast featuring judicator Akouba Kosha. Use the following text as it is or improvise based on it:</p><p>People have gathered around a holo screen showing the latest news from the Bulletin. Proud dignitaries, beautiful courtesans, and wealthy merchants discuss the event in low voices.</p><p><em>Correspondent Jeyla Kuhari is standing on the Promenade outside Wahib’s. Next to her stands judicator Akouba Kosha, shifting uncomfortably in the limelight.</em></p><p><em>“Over to our correspondent Jeyla who has more information about the shooting at Wahib’s.”</em></p><p><em>“Thank you Jalab, that is correct. I have with me judicator Kosha who is in charge of the investigation. My sources tell me that the victim of the shooting in the cantina here behind us is not the first so-called mystic that has been killed recently. Is that true, judicator?”</em></p><p><em>“That is correct.”</em></p><p><em>“Is it true that you have linked the events of today to seven other murders?”</em></p><p><em>“That is correct.”</em></p><p><em>“And isn’t it probable that more bodies will surface during your investigation, as over a dozen new mystics have been reported missing?”</em></p><p><em>“We will not speculate about the investigation at this time. Many of the new mystics choose to leave their old lives behind, which could be a factor contributing to the reported disappearances.”</em></p><p><em>“What is your comment on the rumor that only Firstcome people have been affected by the mystic’s disease?”</em></p><p><em>“I cannot comment on that.”</em></p><p><em>“Can’t, won’t – or aren’t allowed to?”</em></p><p><em>“Can’t, as I don’t know the answer.”</em></p><p><em>“Going back to the six victims you have examined so far, what can you say about their backgrounds?”</em></p><p><em>“That it would appear on the surface that your rumor might hold up so far, but that doesn’t mean…”</em></p><p><em>“Thank you, judicator Kosha – back to you, Jalab.”</em></p><p><em>“Thank you, Jeyla. With us for commentary here in the studio are…”</em></p><p><em>A group of serious experts from different factions and organizations sit around a table in the studio. They all talk a lot and with earnest dedication, but no new facts are added.</em></p><p>The events at Wahib’s are directly linked to the martyr strike team – it has hunted down and killed an escaped mystic from the Cellar. The victim might be a mystic from the Ghazali such as Khomina, or someone that the PCs have met during the scenario so far, such as Althea, if they haven’t made sure she is protected. Alternatively, you could let this be the end of Aram Yafa, unless you had him killed earlier. The name of the victim can be found out through judicator Akouba.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"XhFVB0936YyC5H9P","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297015,"modifiedTime":1682695297015,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"UTesa86R9Yc5tKiL","sort":0,"_id":"Ge8WVjS6BG00qwIg"}

The very first thing the starfarers noticed when they arrived at Lubau was that the axial tilt of the planet was 43 degrees and that the same side was always facing the sun. This means that the planet is without seasons and that the variations in temperature between the hemispheres are enormous. Current science says that this is due to an earlier collision with another planetary body that is now missing.</p><p>Another quirk that carries practical implications is that the magnetosphere of the planet is slight, but very strong. This explains why the only space station in orbit, Kadcidil (“the eye of the sun” in local dialects), can remain so “close” to the surface and always stay on the nightside. This is also the reason why there are no communications satellites above Lubau. Yet another mystery is that Lubau, despite its small size, has roughly the same gravitational pull as Kua. The astronics of the Foundation have no explanation for this, but it could be connected to the many problems encountered by geochemists here; despite all their advanced technology, they have a hard time getting more than shallow readings from the planet’s surface.</p><h4>NIGHT AND DAY</h4><p>The two hemispheres are completely different. The temperature in the hottest areas of the southern hemisphere can reach well over 600 degrees Celsius during the day, while the northern half of the planet has more normal temperatures of between 50 and 100 degrees Celsius. There is no naturally occurring life in the southern hemisphere whatsoever, only traveling ore refineries on giant tracks or anti-grav runners that gather molten ore from the ground. The refineries are isolated, peculiar communities that foster a hard and bleak population. The north has a small belt where natural life exists in the form of a few types of resilient steppe grass, the slow-moving dromedons and the feral dirhad. Sandstone fossils found in the northern desert also indicate that the planet at some point had both forests and oceans. Many Foundation chemists have written their theses about the history of Lubau, but no one has been able to present a solid theory that accounts for the planet’s oddities yet.</p><p>The northern belt is divided into three provinces: Kerahana, Tersin and Nihar. Firstcome nomads wandering across the wastes between the oases originally inhabited these areas. Zenithian settlers later colonized the belt, especially the Kerahana province, founding what would later become the Mehrabi metropolis. Farthest to the north, where the sun never shines, there are massive glaciers. A handful of mining corporations come here to mine ice for the fusion reactors of the spaceships that visit Kadcidil.</p><h4>NOMADS AND FACTIONARIES</h4><p>The indigenous people of Lubau consist of many different nomadic tribes, the two largest being the Beri and the Xinghur. The nomads live on the steppes of the northern hemisphere, although many of them have settled permanently around the new city of Mehrabi.</p><p>Mehrabi is the heart of the planet’s petroleum and petrochemical industry and the place where the factions have the most power. Both Mehrabi and the city of Nihari are formally under the protection of the Consortium, while Tersin and the oasis settlements in the north are independent communities. The two largest refineries, Horizon and Terminator, are free from faction involvement and run as family cooperatives.</p><p>The Icon faith is generally very strong here, with some refineries being almost theocracies. The Free League and the Colonial Agency both own a couple of smaller refineries.</p><h4>THE FAITHFUL</h4><p>The population of Lubau is very devout, but practice a version of the Icon faith in which local myths related to the climate, the sun, and the desert play an important part. The Icons are often pictured differently here, especially the Judge. Around the Mahanji oasis, the Judge is revered as Ulung, the stone dragon, and the Faceless One is almost always Zahdak, the black dragon, Ulung’s opposite. Several pyromaniac cults thrive in the south, praising heat and fire in a heathen belief that this is the true aspect of the Judge.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"jsRaNq3uvUai144x","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266026,"modifiedTime":1680376266026,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"HIluuohFzsm4ozN0"}

This scene is open and will describe a series of places for the group to visit and what happens there rather than just a chain of events.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The situation is simple – the PCs look for traces of their missing friend by following up on Althea’s clues from the previous scene. They can:</p><ul><li>Look for Aram Yafa, Noor’s mysterious friend who never showed up to the meeting. Althea doesn’t know where Aram lives, or how and where he and Noor met.</li><li>Investigate Noor’s apartment. They will find clues pointing toward the Samaritan Sanatorium and clues that help them track down Aram Yafa.</li><li>Ask around the Ozone Plaza, the Student district, the Guard point, or the Neoptra for information about the fake guards.</li></ul><p>The martyr strike team is continuing the search for Althea and unless she is under the PCs' protection, there is a substantial risk of her being kidnapped (see Events below). Wherever the PCs go, they will be met with suspicion if they ask questions about mystics – people will be more helpful if they are asking about a missing friend or relative. Tensions are running high on the station, with fights and loud arguments breaking out here and there in the streets. The Bulletin news shows are on in the background in most shops and cantinas, and will feature the PCs' investigation if they uncover something that would make a dramatic headline.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>REFERENCING THE FRIEND</h4><p>In addition to the missing friend, the commotion in the spaceport has brought more eyes on the PCs. Players who aren’t willing to look for clues and try to solve The Mysticides will become a part of it whether they want to or not. The Bulletin’s snooping journalist, Ahuro’s corrupt guards, or the strike team themselves may all be interested in the PCs’ actions. However, if you find that it’s hard to progress through Act 1 you can instead choose to escalate the conflict to the disappearance of the Emissary and the start of Act 2</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><p><em>”Can’t sleep. Don’t dare to. I’ve got the curse, it’s me they are talking about. Everything they’re saying is happening to me.”</em></p><p><em>”Aram was right. The medicurgs at the Sanatorium do really listen. Everything will be fine they say.”</em></p><p><em>”It is contagious they say. Must keep it within me, must not let anyone else be affected by this.”</em></p><p><em>”I have received a gift. The Icons have blessed me! The Emissary spoke to me in my dreams. A time of Change is soon here!”</em></p><p>Noor’s Diary</p></div><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs must find the clues and pieces of information below in order for the scene to end. Most of it is either leads pointing in the direction of the Sanatorium or more information about the fake guards. It is not necessary for the PCs to find Aram Yafa, and as the GM you could choose to progress to the next scene as soon as the group’s suspicions about the Sanatorium and the fake guards have been firmly established. The goal of the scene is for them to carry these suspicions with them into Act 2.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SANATORIUM</h5><p>The PCs must find one or more of the following clues pointing them toward the Samaritan Sanatorium:</p><ul><li><strong>The Apartment</strong>: There is a pamphlet in Noor’s apartment with information about the mystic’s disease and the Sanatorium. Scribbled on the back is a date from a few days ago, before Noor disappeared.</li><li><strong>The Diary</strong>: Noor appears to have sought out the Sanatorium on Aram Yafa’s recommendation to be cured from nirs illness.</li><li><strong>The Communicator</strong>: Noor’s com contains information about two appointments made with healers at the Sanatorium.</li><li><strong>The Snitch</strong>: If Aram Yafa is found and threatened, he will divulge that the fake guards probably will have taken the missing mystics to the Samaritan Sanatorium in the Core.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FAKE GUARDS</h5><p>During the scene, it is important that the PCs start suspecting that they are dealing with a group of fake guards, although the true identities of the martyr warriors should not be revealed yet. They must find one or more of the following clues:</p><ul><li><strong>The Diary</strong>: A few diary entries describe that Noor has noticed someone following nem. One of the stalkers is described as “scarred, with a shaved head”.</li><li><strong>Witnesses</strong>: Clean shaven guards have been seen on the outskirts of the Ozone Plaza, which is unusual as it is the Legion who normally keeps the peace there.</li><li><strong>The Guard Points/Ahuro</strong>: There is no squad of shaved guards working at any of the Guard points in the Neoptra or on the Ozone Plaza.</li><li><strong>The Snitch</strong>: Aram Yafa is himself a mystic and has been forced to help the fake guards catch other mystics under threat of being taken away himself.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SNITCH</h5><p>Although catching Aram Yafa isn’t strictly necessary, questioning the unlucky deckhand will provide the most obvious grounds for suspecting the Sanatorium and the fake guards. The following information should lead the PCs to Aram:</p><ul><li><strong>The Diary</strong>: Several meetings with Aram in the last couple of weeks are mentioned here, in cantinas near to or on the Ozone Plaza, such as Wahib’s and Al-Said’s.</li><li><strong>The Communicator</strong>: Noor’s com has recently been wiped of most of its data, but apart from the message to the PCs, it also contains a message from Aram saying that he wants to meet Althea and Noor outside of Al-Said’s Oporium by the Ozone Plaza.</li><li><strong>Witnesses</strong>: Witnesses both around Noor’s apartment and around Wahib’s and the Ozone Plaza can describe Aram Yafa to the PCs.</li><li><strong>The Infonet/the Stevedore Akbar</strong>: Aram Yafa is not difficult to find as his address is listed in logs from previous employers in the spaceport.</li></ul><h4>THE RING AND CORE OF CORIOLIS</h4><p>As this is an open scene, there are a number of places the PCs could visit when searching for clues. Below are descriptions of a few locations in the Ring and the Core the group might seek out. You can read more about the different areas of the station in chapter 4 of the Coriolis Core Rulebook. Read up on the locations and then read the events associated with them below.</p><p>A general theme for both the Ring and the Core is the constant appearance of dusk. Streetlights, storefronts, and neon signs are the only lights here. The streets are crowded with people, and depending on where the PCs are, the air is either stale and sweaty or heavy with spices and perfume. The residential modules by the Promenade are especially busy.</p>@JournalEntry[The Ring And The Core Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NOOR’S APARTMENT</h5><p>If you altered where the Noor character lives or who it is, the paragraph below may need some changes. The location’s clues are what is important.</p><p>Noor lived in a dorm room in one of the student barracks by the Academy tube stop. The neighborhood is bustling with every kind of student: Legion cadets in immaculate uniforms; courtesans in light, intricately embroidered burkanas; engineers crowding around tabulas; and tabak smoking aspiring correspondents with piercing eyes and flaming hearts. The different universities try to outshine one another, constructing magnificent lecture halls and office buildings, but the student dorms look more like a Colonial Agency mass housing project on some distant frontier. Read more about the University and Student districts on page 262 in the Coriolis Core Rulebook @JournalEntry[The Core].</p><p>Althea can show the PCs the way to Noor’s room if they ask her. Noor lived alone in a sparsely furnished room containing a bed, a desk covered in notes, and a shelf with a few paper books on it. The room contains several important clues for the PCs to find – see the At Noor’s event below.<br />Althea also dropped Noor’s communicator while fleeing from the fake guards here. When searching the apartment, or while looking for the missing communicator, the PCs can encounter the following NPCs:</p><ul><li><strong>Mimia Moridorah (First year student)</strong>: Most people would describe first year students as confused chain smokers who constantly misplace their tabulas and mix binge drinking with bursts of intense studying. Mimia fits the bill perfectly, but she is also a mystic – sometimes, she gets a vision of the answers to an upcoming test, and is currently being accused of cheating. As she is on a scholarship, the accusations have made her future very uncertain. She lives in the same corridor as Noor and heard the guards search the area. She hid until they had left, and found Noor’s communicator going back to her room. She is low on birr and is considering selling it to afford next segment’s rent.</li><li><strong>Ekvias Memoxes (Dorm supervisor)</strong>: As a long time student and experienced flunker, Ekvias is starting to become a part of the furniture on campus. He thinks that this gives him respect, but the more successful students all laugh at him behind his back. As a dorm supervisor in a building with a lot of students from the Lyceum of Propaganda, Ekvias has his hands full but knows just about everything that goes on in the area. He has noticed both the dodgy group of guards and that Noor has been on edge, and has just heard a rumor saying that someone in his dorm is looking to sell a slightly outdated com.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> OBSTACLES ALONG THE WAY</h5><p>The Samaritan Sanatorium should start to look really suspicious during this scene, but the PCs should not investigate it until Act 2. If the group decides to visit the Sanatorium now, it is time to introduce one of the more threatening events. The martyr strike team has been shadowing them and is starting to realize that the PCs are getting a little too close to the truth. If the group is wavering in their resolve to visit the Sanatorium, a warning might be enough (the threatening message on their coms), but if they seem undeterred, they should get attacked by the group of stevedores, and then hear the news about the disappearance of the Emissary.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE OZONE PLAZA AND AL-SAID’S</h5><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/ozontorget.webp\" /></div><p>Althea has told the PCs about the meeting that was supposed to have taken place at Al-Said’s Oporium (a gambling den and tabakery) a couple of days ago, when the fake guards first tried to arrest her. This tip should lead the group to the busy markets of the Ozone Plaza, the place where every technological need can be satisfied – if a gadget or gizmo cannot be found here, it probably doesn’t exist. Among the tents and stalls brimming with goods, loud merchants scream out their prices and street urchins and thieves do their best to empty the pockets of inexperienced shoppers. If the PCs ask around the plaza they will find a number of people who can help them, either for free or for a handful of birr (You can use table 11.15 on page 256 @JournalEntry[The Ring] of the Coriolis Core Rulebook to generate additional NPCs if you like):</p><ul><li><strong>Karoum (Peddler)</strong>: Karoum is an old ship mechanic who was able to leave the darkness of the void and become a peddler on the Ozone Plaza after an unusually lucrative salvage job. He has purchased all the right permits from the Judicators and has paid off the local gangs to be left alone to conduct his business in a small stall strategically close to Al-Said’s. His main problem is the gangs of shoplifting children that roam around the area. Karoum dresses in a simple but stylishly purple gallabeya and the loose opening shows a scarred chest covered in whitening hair. His hands are sinewy but strong, and he is as competent with delicate soldering on stolen coms and tags as he is with banging dents out of a Legion chestplate. Karoum can fix up almost anything (Wits 4, Technology/Science 4). He witnessed Althea being chased by guards a few days ago.</li><li><strong>Iala, Tam, and Mahmo Janoun (Street Urchins)</strong>: The streets around the Ozone Plaza and the sacks of spices in the stalls outside of Al-Said’s are where the Janoun siblings call home. They roam the streets, taking what they can from unsuspecting visitors and yelling merchants. The children are dirty and have dried snot under their noses, but their eyes are clear and brown, ready to tear up against gullible passersby. They wear simple and worn clothing – wide trousers and over-sized caftans that can hide a surprising amount of loot. They have heard about the incident with Althea and the guards, and a few hours prior, they spotted the clean shaven guards meeting with a young man inside the tabakery</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>AL-SAID’S OPORIUM</h4><p>At the edge of the Ozone Plaza, where the haggling arms dealers, light-fingered cyber merchants, and rugs covered in spare parts give way to simpler stalls and kawah trolleys, one finds Al-Said’s Oporium. The establishment began as a traditional tavern, and became a second home for Legionnaires and merchants who needed food, drink, and somewhere to rest during the early hours of the fourth watch. Dark pillars made of Kuan hardwood draped in silk hide the dirty beams in the ceiling and the dusty ventilation system. The floors are covered in Sadaalian rugs and the small tables are lit by sugar globes floating in small pots of syrup. The proprietor is the Sadaalian hedonist and connoisseur of fine drugs Tahir Em Al-Said. He is an ex-Lama member and has the gang’s signature lip tattoo, framed by a big beard decorated with pearls. His rough hands are covered in gold rings and his icy blue eyes are surrounded by very tasteful face painting. Tahir is a respected man despite his checkered past, and can count many merchants and deckhands as well as Legionnaires and gang members among his friends. The Oporium is a calm haven where the guests leave their shoes at the door and their guns holstered to come together over a purring hookah, a nice meal, or a relaxed game of dice.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GUARD POINT 37 – THE OZONE PLAZA</h5><p>In the encounter with the fake guards in the Neoptra, the PCs might have suspected that something was wrong. Such suspicions could have been strengthened by Ahuro’s intervention and the fact that the fake guards got away so easily. When the PCs visit the Ozone Plaza police station, they notice that the stone front facade of Guard point 37 is cracked and riddled with holes from Vulcan fire. On the steps underneath the sigil of the Guard, a stylized diamon, lies a snoring drunk.   A guard leans casually against the door jamb, chewing tabak with her hair let down. These are the station’s finest – the Coriolis Guard. Guard point 37 is a typical neighborhood office, or a karkolu as they are called on the station. It is located in the alleys by the Ozone Plaza and a lot of criminals, guards, and Legionnaires pass through here. Inside there is a large reception desk, staffed by Sergeant Chima Ouros – a few smaller desks where the guards handle their paperwork, a large jail, and a cellar containing a weapons locker and an evidence room. There is a constant smell of tabak, sweat, and urine here, despite the hard work of Gelof the cleaner.<br />The station is low on personnel and the few guards here are either going somewhere or hunched over stacks of arrest forms. If they put their minds to it, the PCs can meet the following NPCs:</p><ul><li><strong>Chima Ouros (Sergeant)</strong>: Chima towers behind her desk like a stiff, enormous statue. She is responsible for logging all arrests, complaints, and reports. She wears her chestnut hair in a tight knot and her dark, unsettling stare makes sure that visitors to her office keep their conversations short. She wears a shoulder holster containing a massive Vulcan pistol that looks to have seen extensive use. She is very reluctant to answer questions about alleged corruption in the Guard, but could be persuaded to reveal that they have no guards in service here that match the descriptions of the fake guards from the spaceport.</li><li><strong>Gelof (Cleaner)</strong>: Gelof is Guard point 37’s cleaner, and he never seems to leave the building, much like Sergeant Ouros. Gelof is a young man with a crooked back and curious eyes that peek out from behind thick, black bangs. His tireless mopping and scrubbing never quite seem to make a room clean, just cleaner.  Gelof hears about everything that happens in the building.  He might pass on a whisper or two if there is birr to be made, with Sergeant Ouros' silent approval, of course. He can tell the PCs that inspector Ahuro and some of the guards have made some form of deal with some people on the Ring. During the investigation of the Mysticides, the dirty guards have promised to stay away from certain places at certain times.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GUARD POINT 13 – THE NEOPTRA</h5><p>The PCs could also choose to visit Guard point 13 in the Neoptra, which is not as busy as point 37. Here they will meet with inspector @Actor[Merk Ahuro] (page 21).</p><ul><li><strong>Bribes</strong>: Guards at several different posts around the Ring have been ordered by Ahuro to accept bribes to ignore the fake guards. No ordinary guard would ever admit to this and the PCs will only hear this information if they truly win over Ahuro to their side.  Doing that requires both figuring out that he himself is a mystic and that the fake guards are the ones responsible for the Mysticides.</li><li><strong>Previous Entanglements</strong>: If the PCs were arrested or yelled at by inspector Ahuro in the starting scene, he will make it very clear that he never wishes to see them again in his life. A large enough bribe might sooth his wrath however, and if the PCs promise him a drink or five, he might even be willing to talk</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE STEVEDORE CENTRAL</h5><p>The group’s investigations may lead them to the stevedore central. If they have been here during a previous scene, the outcome of that will of course affect how they are received this time.</p><ul><li><strong>Aram Yafa</strong>: When asking around about Aram Yafa – by name and profession or by com number – stevedore Akbar Xiu Xichama (page 23 @JournalEntry[01 - Starting Scene: The Attack]) might be persuaded (manipulation –1) to look through old employment records for information. In addition to the manipulation roll, the PCs will have to also provide some additional information about Aram, like his communicator number, full name, or profession. Just his first name won’t be sufficient. The records contain an address – three residential modules between Wahib’s and the Ozone Plaza, just above the Promenade.</li><li><strong>After the Ambush</strong>: If the PCs have been attacked by the group of stevedores, they can try to find out more about this from Xiu. After some resistance, she promises to ask around, but if the martyr strike team is the last missing link in the PCs' investigation, you could have Xiu tell the PCs that a group of guards paid the stevedores handsomely to teach the nosy PCs a lesson. They didn’t act like normal guards however, and if the group doesn’t know this yet, Xiu can tell them that the guards had a strange accent.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE YAFAS' MODULES</h5><p>Laughing and squabbling neighbors, crying children, and barking dogs – the residential modules above the Promenade are a constant whirl of noise and activity. The modules themselves are made from different materials and painted in every imaginable color, and the maze of balconies, canopies, and crisscrossing clothes lines outside only add to the neighborhood’s chaotic appearance. The Promenade can be heard as a distant murmur from below.<br />The Yafases live in three conjoined residential modules – each of them made up of just a single room, forcing much of the family life out onto the narrow terrace outside. The Promenade is located a few stories down, and the colorful roofs of the merchant stalls below look like a strange, organic mosaic.</p><p>If the PCs come here looking for Aram Yafa, his family will insist on them staying for baklava and kawah. Aram’s father is a regular contestant in the highly prestigious baklava competitions on the Spice Plaza. The pastries are served with strong, black kawah, thick with sugar, and the conversation is framed by constant interruptions from four over-excited children being chased around the PCs by the older siblings. The Yafases' modules are a packed mess of bunk beds, stoves and cheap furniture. The family will gladly entertain their guests until their son comes home, and as the GM you are free to determine if you want to end the scene in this location (see Events below).</p><ul><li><strong>Cheram Yafa (Master Baklava Chef)</strong>: Aram’s father and “head” of the family. Cheram is a multiple baklava tournament winner with a big belly and an even bigger laugh who loves to talk to new people – mainly about pastries though. He is of the opinion that his son lacks motivation, but not that he is up to something illegal.</li><li><strong>Yohara Yafa (Family Matriarch)</strong>: The actual decision-maker in the clan is Yohara, Aram’s mother. She makes sure that there are always dates, hot kawah, and big trays of Cheram’s pastries on the table. She is more worried than Cheram about Aram’s lack of direction, but doesn’t know any details about her son’s affairs.</li></ul><h4>NPCs</h4><p>In this scene, the PCs could encounter the independent actor Jeyla Kuhari (see Events) as well as numerous other characters who can provide them with the clues described above. The NPCs that are tied to specific locations are less detailed. Should you need their attribute or skill levels, use the NPC list on page 343 @JournalEntry[Your Job as the GM] in the Coriolis Core Rulebook. Finally, the PCs might find Aram Yafa, who can give them some much needed answers (see Important facts).</p><ul><li><p>@Actor[Aram Yafa]<br /></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/aramyafa_full.webp\" /></div><p></p></li><li>@Actor[Jeyla Kuhari]</li><li>@Actor[Stevedore Thugs]</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h4>Handout #1: The Sanatorium Pamphlet</h4><p>@JournalEntry[The Sanatorium Pamphlet]<br />Do you have nightmares?<br />Are strange things happening around you, or do you see visions of things you couldn’t possibly know?

This is the location with the most clues in the scene, but let the PCs search for the information, instead of just giving it to them. The module is small, with little furniture except for a mattress on the floor, a small desk, and some simple kitchen appliances. If Althea (who has a key) is not with the PCs, they will have to find some other way to enter. The lock on the door is weak and can be forced or hacked (normal force test/easy data djinn test), but if the roll fails, the group will have attracted the attention of dorm supervisor Memoxes. The following clues can be found inside the apartment:</p><ul><li><strong>Pamphlet</strong>: A pamphlet on the desk containing information about the Samaritan Sanatorium, advertising treatment for the mystic’s disease.</li><li><strong>The Cache</strong>: Noor’s back-up transactor with 2,000 birr (data djinn –2 to unlock) is hidden under a loose tile in the floor. The cache also contains Noor’s diary with entries up until the day of nirs disappearance.</li><li><strong>The Diary</strong>: The diary describes several meetings with Aram over the last couple of weeks in cantinas such as Wahib’s and Al-Said’s around the Ozone Plaza. It also reveals that Noor, on Aram’s suggestion, has contacted and visited the Sanatorium. The entries after the visit to the Sanatorium are erratic, describing the mystic power as both a blessing and a dark shame. The last entries are increasingly paranoid, speaking about “scarred, bald” guards following Noor.</li></ul><p>The students Mimia and Ekvias can both be found close to Noor’s home. They have seen or heard parts of what has happened and can give further in<strong>formation</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Stolen Com</strong>: Mimia Moridorah, a student living in the same corridor as Noor, has found the com unit Althea dropped when she ran from the guards (data djinn –1 to track the com signal, manipulation –2 to find it by asking around). Mimia has put the word out that she is looking to sell the com for 100 birr.</li><li><strong>Messages in the Communicator</strong>: The communicator contains several conversations between Noor and Aram, and a message from Aram asking Noor to show up an hour early to the meeting with Althea so they can talk before she arrives. The last message is followed by several unanswered calls from Althea (Noor left the com at home). The last message from Aram can be used to contact him, or to find out where he lives.</li><li><strong>The Dorm Supervisor</strong>: If Ekvias can be convinced that the PCs aren’t burglars, he will share with them that he has spent many late nights drinking with Noor, who has seemed scared and nervous lately. He has also heard about a com for sale in the building. Earlier today, he encountered a group of guards turning Noor’s apartment upside down (after Althea had escaped them).</li><li><strong>The Guards</strong>: Ekvias can reveal that today wasn’t the first time he saw these particular guards – two of them visited the corridor in plain clothes about a week ago, but he shooed them out.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THIEVES AND SPICES</h5><p>If the PCs visit the Ozone Plaza or Al-Said’s, chances are good that they will run into the Janoun children. A young girl in simple clothes but with an embroidered, red dupatta tugs at the sleeve of one of the PCs (the one with the lowest Empathy score). She looks up with tears in her eyes and stretches out a shaking, empty hand.</p><ul><li><strong>The Thieves</strong>: At the cost of 1 DP, you can have the Janouns steal something from the PCs. Unless a PC makes an active attempt to spot the crime (observation –1), Liala’s two brothers will try to steal one thing each from someone in the group and then run in opposite directions. Liala ducks under Karoun’s tool stand and disappears into the crowd, leaving only her red shawl behind. The PCs might try to catch the thieves and can apprehend one of the kids by successfully testing observation and dexterity.</li><li><strong>The Janoun Humanites</strong>: Older sister Liala lives with her two younger brothers, twins Tam and Mahmo, in the alleys around the Ozone Plaza. The are humanite descendents of the Krahin, workers from the Marfik system brought to work on Coriolis under slavelike conditions. Their humanite talent is equivalent of the @Item[Regenerate] sculpt (see page 77 of the Coriolis Core Rulebook), and also slows down their aging. The kids look significantly younger than they actually are, and have learned to use this to their advantage. If one or more of the siblings are caught by the PCs, they will do whatever they can to escape – promising to help the PCs, steal for them, sell them secrets – anything they can think of. If the PCs let them go before they have revealed the promised information, they will slither away without another word. They can be questioned for clues as long as they are in captivity, however.</li><li><strong>The Children’s Story</strong>: If one of the Janouns is captured or bribed, they can tell the PCs about the guards who chased that poor woman through the spice stands outside Al-Said’s. The Coriolis Guard usually stay away from the Ozone Plaza, and the children mainly have to worry about Legionnaires and judicators. A few hours before the spectacle at the oporium, Mahmo (one of the brothers) saw the guards talking to a young man standing outside Al-Said’s (he describes Aram Yafa). A little later, Liala saw another person (Noor) meet up with Aram, after which they both slipped into one of the alleys next to the plaza. In the alley, the children saw three bald guards threaten one of the visitors (Noor) with guns and lead nem away.</li><li><strong>The Merchant</strong>: The old tech pusher and repairman Karoum has a stall close to Al-Said’s, and will offer his sincere sympathies if the PCs were pickpocketed by the Janouns. For a nice chat and some birr to go with it, he can also tell them about a strange thing he witnessed a few days ago. A young woman came to Al-Said’s, obviously looking for something, but she suddenly started pushing people and ran out with a group of angry guards chasing her.</li><li><strong>The Gambler</strong>: If you want to, you can let the regular crowds at Wahib’s or Al-Said’s recognize a description of Aram Yafa and recall his frequent visits, sometimes together with others, but usually alone and with money on his mind. Just recently, he has begun betting larger sums than before, and has paid off some old debts</li></ul><p>Cost: 0–1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FOLLOWED</h5><p>Someone is following the PCs. Use this scene to let them attempt an observation roll or to make them aware that someone knows about their investigation. Depending on who the followers are, this scene could also introduce an independent actor such as Kuhari the correspondent or inspector Ahuro. The main goal of the scene is to create suspense, but a captured follower could of course provide clues of great value.<br />Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A CURIOUS REPORTER</h5><p><em>“Weren’t you involved in that spectacle in the spaceport?” asks a woman in discreet but exclusive clothes. She holds up a com set to record and continues: “What are you doing here? Maybe a short interview, ne?”</em></p><p>Jeyla Kuhari, the disgraced reporter, recognizes the PCs and tries to get an interview to find out what they are up to. She is looking into the Mysticides and has been tipped off about the PCs’ investigation. If the actions of the PCs cause further disturbances, Jeyla might show up again and be even more insistent in her attempts to find out what is going on.<br />Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AMBUSH!</h5><p>You are suddenly surrounded by grinning stevedores who seem to materialize out the shadows, armed with pipes, brass knuckles, power gloves, and knives. “You should keep your noses out of other people’s business!” says the one who seems to be the leader – and then they attack! The martyr strike team has had enough of the PCs' snooping and wishes to warn them, test their mettle, or simply get rid of them. A group of spaceport thugs are hired to sort out the problem. Some of them might know Althea, or she might know them. The thugs have been ordered to make it look like a mugging gone wrong. One of the fake guards could be hiding nearby to supervise the attack and the PCs can spot this if they win an opposed <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> test. If the strike team is discovered, they will quickly try to get away.</p><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARAM – THE PRODIGAL SON</h5><p>If the PCs visit the Yafases’ residential modules and are friendly (or at least not overtly rude or hostile), they can spend a few pleasant hours in the company of the loud and cheerful Cheram (Aram’s father) and quiet and firm Yohara (Aram’s mother). There seems to be an endless supply of kawah, dates, and baklava at hand, and as the hours pass, Aram’s four younger siblings begin to like one or a couple of the PCs more and more.</p><ul><li>Eventually, Aram shows up in the middle of the umpteenth cup of kawah, bursting through the door, looking worn and worried. His father grins at him and says that some friends of his have stopped by and that everyone is having a great time, but Aram’s nervous smile disappears in an instant and he rushes out into the street to try to disappear into the crowds on the Promenade below.</li><li>The PCs could either try to catch him now or seek him out later (see below). If they chase Aram now, let it be a desperate scene where they clearly have the upper hand. As they are starting to either catch up with or surround him, one or a few of the PCs receive telepathic visions of his cries for help.<br />If the PCs catch Aram, he will admit to what he has done and tell them all he knows (see below).</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARAM’S CONFESSION</h5><p>This event will most likely mark the end of the scene. When cornered, Aram will give up and tell the PCs everything he knows. This should give the group enough information to proceed to the end of Act 1.</p><ul><li><strong>The Guards</strong>: He was apprehended by a group of guards a few weeks ago. They threatened to tell his family about his illness (the mystic’s disease) and to make sure that Cheram – the family’s main provider – would be out of a job if Aram didn’t do as they told him.</li><li><strong>The Reward</strong>: They also gave him a tag with 5,000 birr (of which he has already spent 1500 on his gambling addiction) and promised him more money for every mystic he could help them “treat”.</li><li><strong>The Mission</strong>: Aram’s task was to befriend other mystics and tell them to show up at a certain place at a certain time, where the fake guards would be waiting for them after Aram had sent a message via an encrypted communicator. With a hard (–2) roll for data djinn, the recipient can be tracked to the vicinity of the sanatorium.</li><li><strong>The Mystics</strong>: The guards told Aram that they could cure the mystics of the affliction, but after the recent news reports about murdered mystics, Aram is not so sure anymore. Any mystics identified by Aram were first to be taken to the Sanatorium for evaluation. If the PCs specifically ask for it, Aram can give them a list of all the people he has either sent to the Sanatorium or given up to the guards. This could come in handy during Act 2.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARAM’S DEATH</h5><p>If the PCs choose to let Aram go after they have questioned him – or if you as the GM think that the hunt for the bait should have a darker ending – use the following event:</p><ul><li>The leader of the martyr strike team, Salamah ach-Abaud, starts to regard Aram as a security risk, a loose end. When the kidnapping of the Emissary draws closer, Salamah decides to tie up all such loose ends. She sends three of her warriors to kidnap and murder Aram.</li><li>Only a few hours before the news of the disappearance of the Emissary break, the Bulletin reports that yet another body has been found, but that the Coriolis Guard are unsure of whether it has anything to do with the so-called Mysticides or not. Inspector Merk Ahuro of the Guard releases a short statement soon after saying that the murder of deckhand Aram Yafa looks to be gang-related, in light of the deceased’s massive gambling debts.</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"an367AEwEVJZttPw","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296453,"modifiedTime":1682695296453,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mAHpd3t9ttfiOKXR","sort":0,"_id":"I0uaXCTJIJLMbGz7"}

This scene is not optional and will provide the PCs with vital information, for example via a press release or a Bulletin news report. You can choose when to start this scene, but a suggestion is to wait until the PCs have enough leads pointing them in the direction of the Sanatorium. The scene is not tied to a specific location, but written as if it is taking place in the Ozone Plaza.</p><p><em>The Ozone Plaza is silent – only a low murmur can be heard from the crowds huddling around the info terminals and the holo screens in the shops, but it heralds the coming of a storm of unseen magnitude. The air is thick with anticipation and almost painful to breathe as you make your way toward the nearest terminal. A reporter on the screen says in a grave voice: “The Emissary from Xene has disappeared…”</em></p><p>The risks of demonstrations and rioting are great on the station as the news about the disappearance breaks.

Before reaching the station, one of the PCs also has a mysterious vision.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE VISION</h5><p>One of the PCs (most likely one with the mystic powers skill, or the Preacher concept) experiences a powerful vision of future events. It might seem like an odd twist at the end of this scenario, but it ties in with the coming scenarios in the Mercy of the Icons campaign. If you don’t plan on playing the campaign or if you want a more immediate explanation, the vision may instead concern an additional ship of survivors from the Ghazali drifting in space, whom the PCs, thanks to the vision, are able to locate and rescue.</p><p><em>The stars above you fade into darkness, a suffocating, silent black threatening all life, all hope. The flickering light that remains only serves to emphasize the vastness of the void. The rock below you is cold, scarred by thousands of quiet collisions in deep space, itself a remnant from a larger collision aeons ago, lightyears away. Stardust covers your body. Your breath, which the endless hunger of space should be ripping from your chest, hangs in clouds in front of you, crystallizing on the cold surface of the rock. The stone rotates slowly, held captive in orbit around an alien planet. The planet enters your view, greenish blue under heavy grey clouds. Your rock keeps rotating and the planet disappears, darkness enveloping you once again. When the world below returns, you see raging, eternal storms plaguing the surface, and a single, black monolith protruding through the clouds, reaching for the stars. Lightning seems to be emanating from – or converging on – this lonesome sentinel.</em></p><p><em>Suddenly, the storms subside, only to explode in a single, violent discharge seconds later, releasing a lightning bolt headed directly at your rock. The stone shatters into dust, falling out of orbit, and disintegrating as it enters the atmosphere. You hold on to one of the larger fragments, clawing the frozen rock until your fingers bleed frozen, black bubbles of blood onto the stone. You have arrived at your journey’s end, to face the Icons’ judgement. But you find that you aren’t alone. A small child floats next to you in the burning cloud, boy or girl is hard to tell. It fixes a serious gaze on you, and speaks, but you can’t make out the words. You cry out that you can’t hear anything, but the child only smiles. Its voice suddenly reverberates through your head without it moving its lips: ”Everything will be all right”. The clouds below you part and the planet’s greens and blues stun you with their beauty. The stars have returned from the darkness above you, bright dots of hope in the night. You suddenly know that the child is right and let go of your rock. Instead of falling, you softly enter a low orbit around the planet. Serenity fills your soul as you hear the stars sing to you, a transcendent, primordial symphony.</em></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act3/ghazaliomslag4_inlaga.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"zqk9mpH6nCX8I7zm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252223,"modifiedTime":1680376252223,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"TSnpm6L8AX87lGCO","sort":0,"_id":"IqSkmgJDgQRCykYa"}

The system instead becomes a highly militarized no-man’s land, where the fleets of the Order and the Legion go to flex their muscles.</p><h4>PLANETS</h4><p>The system contains only three planets, one of which – Nestero – is a massive gas giant. Nestero has a strange, close orbit around the Hamura star, with the smaller planets Hamura and Yublai on longer orbits farther out. The system is known for its violent ion storms and for its infamous corsair captain, Samina. The Hamurabi portal station orbits the star between the two portals at about ½ AD from both the star and the portals.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NESTERO</h5><p>The Foundation have been studying Nestero for many years to try to explain how the mysterious gas giant can have such a close orbit around its star – gas giants are otherwise found far from the center of their home systems. It is believed that some form of portal-related phenomenon might explain its orbit, and research teams arrive regularly on Hamurabi to undertake dangerous survey expeditions. Nestero has thirteen moons, of which the Abui ice moon is the most widely known. The Colonial Agency runs a mine on Abui where hired hands work long, dangerous shifts mining ice.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HAMURA</h5><p>The planet with the same name as the system is mostly covered in vast oceans. A string of hundreds of thousands of tiny islands can be found along the equator. The gravity effects produced by the relationship between Hamura and her three moons create gigantic tides every four days, with ebb and flow differences of up to a hundred meters. Terrifying storms are common. Hamura is a popular cruise destination thanks to its rich marine fauna and the high concentration of minerals in its water. Its oceans are marketed as “the Horizon’s most natural spa experience,” and well-off people from near and far come here to rest up or calm down. The planet’s only large settlement, Dome Isolda, owes much of its economy to tourism, with underwater cruises departing weekly for distant paradise islands and reefs inhabited by extraordinarily beautiful marine life.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> YUBLAI</h5><p>Yublai is a dark reflection of its sister planet Hamura – covered in boiling lava. Peculiar activity in the planet’s core constantly transports lava to the surface. The volcanic activity also produces a valuable gas, named Bwalya after the discovering prospector. The Agency have made repeated attempts to mine the gas, most recently using ED technology to funnel the gas through the atmosphere up to low-orbit space stations. Technical difficulties have forced them to shut down four of the project’s six stations, and the remaining two are only used for data gathering. The most remote installation, station Gupta, has been claimed as home base by Samina’s dreaded corsairs.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/the hamura system/hamura_systemet.webp\" /></div><h4>TRAVELING IN HAMURA</h4><p>Ion storms and corsairs make the Hamura system more dangerous than one might think. Pages 138–140 in the Coriolis core rulebook detail space travel in the Third Horizon. To the right is a list of events for travel in the Hamura system, but they can quite easily be converted to work in other systems as well.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 3 EVENTS IN THE HAMURA SYSTEM</h4><p>@RollTable[Events In The Hamura System]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>EVENT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Ion Storm</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Nomads</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Distress Call (Fake)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Distress Call (Real)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Derelict Ship</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The Lighthouse Keeper</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ION STORM</h5><p>The sensors suddenly go wild, red lights begin to flash, and the bridge is filled with loud beeps and whines. The PCs have entered one of the dreaded Hamura ion storms. They get no indication of what is coming and may not attempt to avoid it. Flashing, multichromatic lights flicker and dance across their hull. The pilot may attempt to navigate through as quickly and safely as possible by testing pilot at –2. Failure results in the ship suffering a strength 4 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 3) dealing EP damage. Each player must roll a D6. On a roll of one, the person is electrocuted by a nearby overload (strength 3 attack, weapon damage 2, CRIT (shock)).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NOMADS</h5><p>A group of nomads hail the PCs to see if they would be interested in bartering or trading information. They are scavengers from the Odacon system traveling in three class IV salvage ships (equivalent of the @Actor[Kamruk - Salvage Model] on page 159 of the Coriolis core rulebook) and have their haul in a huge net in tow. The leader, Keita, is very hospitable and invites the PCs over to share a festive meal – dhol barbecue (spit-roast prairie dog) and fire kohol. During the dinner, the following might happen:</p><ul><li>Andili Teko, the nomads’ Abba (seer), sits down next to one of the PCs and offers to consult the deck about her future for the modest sum of 200 birr. You can use the Icon deck to create the prophecy.</li><li>Keita offers to barter with the PCs. He would prefer payment in advanced tech or luxuries, but will also accept birr. If the PCs win an opposed manipulation test, they may reduce the prices. The salvaged goods include:</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>SHIP PART</th><th>DEFECT</th><th>COST</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Thermal Cannon</td><td>Broken coolant system. TECHNOLOGY –1 to repair. Requires one advanced spare part.</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>Salvage Module</td><td>Responds slowly. Roll a D6 when used. On a one, 1 point of HP damage is inflicted on the ship being salvaged. Can only be repaired after the flaw has been discovered.

Requires one ordinary spare part.</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Space Scooter</td><td>Broken thrusters. PILOT –2 until repaired. TECHNOLOLGY –1 to repair. One advanced spare part required.</td><td>70,000</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>A young girl travelling with the nomads has tired of life on the move. She sneaks onto the PCs’ ship just as they say their goodbyes to the nomads and hides in the cargo hold. It’s probably going to take a while before the PCs find her. Her name is Mirva and she has a knack for spaceship engines…</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  DISTRESS CALL (FAKE)</h5><p>The PCs are hailed by the courier vessel Khorint II requesting emergency assistance. The Khorint’s captain Radebe says that an explosion onboard has taken out their grav projector. The ship is dead in space, and needs towing and medical assistance. Radebe says that they are on their way to Dome Isolda on Hamura, but they are actually one of Samina’s corsair crews trying to trick the PCs. They wait until the PCs come close, fire a well-aimed acc volley, and attempt to board. They will pursue if the PCs try to run and won’t give up easily. The corsairs number five plus captain Radebe. The Khorint II is a standard courier model (page 142 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Create Your Ship]), owned by Ermes and registered on Caph in the Caph sytem (a successful data djinn test can inform the PCs of this). The corsairs have of course stolen the ship from Ermes, as it looks inconspicuous enough to fool careless travelers.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DISTRESS CALL (REAL)</h5><p>The PCs receive a chaotic distress call from the cruise ship Afora – the captain is dead, the crew and the passengers are in bad shape and there are people shooting at each other onboard. The Afora had just departed Hamura when a firefight broke out. The stand-off is between Syndicate-affiliated smugglers and Consortium agents from Special Branch. The Rafa family have been running guns through the Taoan system for years, but Special Branch caught their scent a few segments back. The SB agents identified a smuggling ring on Hamura and figured out that they were using the luxury cruise ships to transport the weapons. When the smugglers on the Afora by chance noticed the agents on the ship, they panicked and opened fired. The Afora has been turned into a warzone, with the eight smugglers trying to kill the five SB agents, while the hundred-or-so passengers and crew risk getting caught in the crossfire. The PCs can dock with the Afora and board it without problem. The Afora looks much like the Ghazali, and the passengers and crew are holed up in the cantina. If the PCs help sort out the conflict (peacefully or otherwise), they are handsomely compensated (20,000 birr) by the Nigira cruise company and end up on the news across the Horizon.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DERELICT SHIP</h5><p>The PCs pick up a drifting spacecraft on their sensors, a class IV freighter named the Erasmus. It has been ripped open by a reactor explosion (weak radiation) and not even basic life support is online. The cause of the reactor failure is unclear from exterior scans. The horribly mangled bodies of the crew float around inside. The PCs can board and loot the ship should they want to, in which case they find a space scooter, two loader exos, some birr, and assorted personal items. The real treasure sits in the cargo hold, however: a large shipment of Magnena caviar worth almost 30,000 birr. The Magnena is a fish native to Hamura whose eggs are considered a delicacy in many places in the Horizon, especially on Dabaran. But what has happened to the Erasmus? A @Actor[Byara] (page 325 of the Coriolis core rulebook) got onboard the ship and killed the crew. In a final desperate act, captain Masinga caused the reactor overload, hoping to kill the creature even if it cost him his own life. Unfortunately, the byara survived and is still lurking in the dark interior of the ship…</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER</h5><p>The PCs are hailed by the Serero space beacon, where ‘lighthouse keeper’ Majed Habsi leads a life of quiet solitude. He is eager for company and news from the Horizon. He invites the PCs to share a frugal meal with him and inquires if they have anything more savory on their ship to trade. His intentions for contacting them appear to be boredom and loneliness, but the truth behind his calm exterior is that the constant presence of the dark between the stars is getting to him. He waits for a good opportunity to strike and then makes a run for the PCs’ ship, wanting to escape his isolation. If they are unsuccessful at stopping him, they are trapped on the tiny station until another spacecraft comes their way. Majed doesn’t really have a plan, and when the PCs eventually escape the beacon, they can easily track him to Hamurabi where he has ditched their ship in favor of other means of transportation out into the Horizon…</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>SAMINA’S CORSAIRS</h5><p>Samina’s corsairs are known across the entire Horizon and the Council have promised a 10,000 birr reward to anyone who can reveal their hideout to the authorities and bring Samina to justice. The hunt for Samina could easily be made into a thrilling mission for the PCs. The Azandra space station plan from the game box can be used as the corsair hideout.

It consists of three parts and is meant to be played in just a few hours, preferably as a flashback epilogue to the two Emissary Lost scenarios.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  ACT 1: THE STATION (p 213)</h5><p>The characters wake up to a new day aboard FS-7. They are researchers, part of the team contracted to install and oversee an experiment known as the Jarouma Pattern. The station is in a state of anxiety and anticipation. Jarouma Had Peleter herself is arriving to oversee the team’s efforts, but the project has suffered from a few mishaps, and a heated discussion ensues.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 2: THE GAS GIANT (p 219)</h5><p>As the installation goes online, and readouts begin to indicate that the energy pattern is indeed changing, the turmoil in Xene’s atmosphere turns into a dense storm. Hurricane winds destabilize two of the quadrants, and electromagnetic disturbances disable the sensory output from the data probes. The team has to enter the atmosphere and recalibrate the pattern manually.</p><p>The entry is hazardous, and the shuttle takes damage as it docks with the first installation. During repairs, mishaps and dire accidents threaten the crew, but the stern science officer has her orders from Jarouma herself – the mission cannot be aborted. All installations must be activated, and the pattern stabilized in accordance with the algorithm.</p><p>After repairing the third quadrant installation, the network is back online, but now the storm becomes even more severe. Electromagnetic discharges threaten the lives of the team. But there is also good news – the patterns match! All they need to do to complete their mission is to reach the last installation and get the final readouts from its damaged sensor array. However, as the pilot is dying, the science officer has second thoughts. She is willing to abort.</p><p>It’s during this turmoil that the team’s analyst approaches other team members, suggesting that they must continue. The implication of this potential discovery is too great. He will try to convince his teammates, start a mutiny, or steal the shuttle himself.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 3: THE ARRIVAL (p 225)</h5><p>As the storm reaches its climax, suddenly an unforseen event happens. The analyst prays to the Icons and sabotages the ship. One by one, the Emissaries arrive, inside the minds of the five unfortunate scientists.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>DARKNESS POINTS</h4><p>The scenario starts with a number of darkness points equal to the number of players, minimum 4 DP. The game master should use these DP to introduce minor faults during Act 1. The early arrival of Jarouma Had Peleter also adds 1 DP for dramatic effect. Finally, as the storm intensifies, and the research team descends into the atmosphere of Xene, an additional 4 DP is given, to be used for the intrigues in Act 2. Since the scenario contains no outside threats of combat, use the darkness points to break down equipment, create mishaps, and to activate the events in each act.</p><p>Death &amp; Resurrection: You can also use the death of a crew member as a reason to add 1 DP to the pool. The same goes for when they witness a character coming back to life (when she is taken over by an Emissary). As madness and panic strikes, darkness should grow.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>HAZARDOUS ATMOSPHERE</h5><p>The gravity in Xene’s atmosphere makes it hard to move comfortably. Even with an exo, all movement or heavy lifting has an extra –1 penalty when outside the shuttle. As the hurricane winds gradually become more severe (end of Act 2), this penalty changes to –2 for the finale.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"uJn9Po3Mc7AKUQM9","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296209,"modifiedTime":1682695296209,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mMIaH3Q1FeIxhyQM","sort":0,"_id":"JUnBEs9zyQcT6E7C"}
{"name":"The Order of the Pariah","flags":{"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true},"coriolis-corerules":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/09 - Factions","noteRef":""},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-corerules.journalentry.fc148ec75a2793ef"}},"pages":[{"name":"The Order of the Pariah","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/orderofpariah.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></div><p class=\"centerJournalText\">“The end is near.”</p><h3>The Order of the Pariah has an ambivalent reputation in the Horizon. On the one hand, their work with the sick and the poor on Coriolis is greatly lauded, but at the same time, people whisper about their bloody war crimes during the Portal Wars and their crusade against dissidents in their home system, Zalos.</h3><p><strong>On Coriolis</strong>, the Order is known as the Samaritans. They run a hospital, a sanatorium for the hyper sick, a poor house, several soup kitchens and a renowned medical school. The medical students become neophytes of the Order and their education is heavily influenced by the faction’s religious views, but all the students are offered generous scholarships for the duration of their training. When they graduate, they are often offered employment by groups who are otherwise less than friendly towards the Order, a good indication of the quality of the school. The Samaritans appear the perfect believers, helping their fellow human beings out of the kindness of their hearts. This reputation is kept intact on Coriolis thanks to the Samaritan part of their work – the memories of the Order’s involvement in the atrocities of the Portal Wars are not something the station’s mainly Zenithian population keeps alive.</p><p>The council representative for the Order of the Pariah is Sister Almas, headmaster of the medical academy. She is just and resolute, both as a teacher and as a politician. Her students claim that she never sleeps, but instead spends her nights before a statue of the Martyr, deep in prayer.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MARTYRS</h5><p>Outside of Coriolis, the name Samaritans is frowned upon. Here, the Order is known as the Martyrs and have an entirely different reputation. Their symbol, the martyr’s crown, stirs feelings of unease in almost everyone. Stories from the Portal Wars speak of the Order as fanatic Martyr worshippers, merciless in combat and without any concern for their own lives. Their enormous monastery cruisers are said to have carried both crusaders and flagellants into battle, a rumor that is still prevalent.</p><p>The Order of the Pariah is of Firstcome descent, and worships the Martyr (the icon commonly known as the Judge). They were an active party in the Portal Wars, and closed their home system, Zalos, at the end of the war, not opening it until many years later, when the Consortium dispatched the Legion to demand passage. This pattern is now repeating itself – Zalos has been closed once again since one of the Emissaries proclaimed itself the Judge incarnate, a sacrilege according to the Order. It is likely only the fact that the space station at Xene is owned by the Foundation, and thus by extension the Consortium, that has kept the Order from showing their more aggressive side in the Kua system as well. A certain amount of fear always arises when their ships dock at Coriolis however, their hulls depicting cataclysmic scenes of war, and the dockworkers whispering about onboard ossuaries filled with the sacred bones of martyred warriors.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/Pariatet_fraktion.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ORDER’S BIONICS AND FLEET</h5><p>Another reason for concern is that the Order possesses a unique form of biotechnology that, among other things, enables the creation of the animate suits of armor their elite holy warriors use. The first reports of this armor came from Bulletin correspondents who smuggled information out of Zalos about the Order’s relentless hunt for religious dissidents. The technology has again become a topic of discussion on Coriolis as more and more people expect the day when the Legion will turn their weapons against the Order is fast approaching. How large a fleet the Order commands is unclear, but given the fact that the Consortium has yet to order the Legion to open the route through Zalos with force, it is thought to be of considerable size.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>ANIMATE ARMOR</h5><p>The holy warriors of the Order cover themselves in adaptive armor that makes their bodies stronger. The armor also “learns” from hits taken, adjusting itself for better protection, which means you generally only get one shot at taking down a Martyr warrior. This has spawned the saying “Like the first hit on a martyr”, describing an action that has no effect.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"0VHp4jBg7qvKi45m","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266746,"modifiedTime":1680376266746,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"Jmu5z99sDKrWmnvy"}

There is sensitive cargo in a storage unit onboard that she desperately needs to bring back to Coriolis, no matter the cost. The PCs stand to make a good profit if they take her up on her offer.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>Sabetha offers the PCs 25,000 birr (on delivery) if they help her transport the cargo to a secure location. If the PCs open the cargo containers to peek inside, she offers another 15,000 for their silence (which can be raised using manipulation). The cargo comprises twenty (suspiciously coffin-like) boxes marked as containing medical supplies. Sabetha’s shipping manifest looks legit, but it only vaguely specifies the contents of the boxes as ‘therapeutic narcotics’. The boxes are located in a cargo hangar (see the floor plan) on the other side of a locked bulkhead door.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>A successful technology test is required to open the bulkhead door. Without the security tablet provided by Sabetha, the roll is at –2. A failed roll means having to force the door open, costing them 1 EP worth of time (see page 8 @JournalEntry[Introduction - Ghazali]). The most discreet and effective way to load the cargo is to fly a ship down and dock with the hangar from the outside (pilot). A failed roll subjects the ship to a strength 4 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 3). Loading the cargo using the hangar’s loader exo requires a dexterity test.</p><p>Alternatively, the cargo can be loaded using a chain of survivors, but this requires passing an insane (–3) manipulation test to make them prioritize this project. Involving more people in dealing with Sabetha’s cargo will eventually lead to word of it getting around, which could lead to trouble when the PCs reach Hamurabi. There are three loader exos in the hangar, enabling three people to load all of the cargo in one hour if they pass their dexterity tests. For a single person, the loading takes three hours. Failed dexterity tests add time to the loading. Sabetha will protest any attempts to open the boxes, as her payment depends on the cargo arriving untampered with. Curious PCs can of course choose to ignore this and open one of the boxes. A successful technology test is required to open the box without damaging the stasis mechanism that keeps the cargo – a human – alive. If you as the GM don’t feel like letting the PCs explore this sidepath right now, you could, for example, require them to have a special codebreaker to open the boxes, one they can only find on Coriolis.</p><h4>THE CARGO HANGAR</h4><p>Most of the Ghazali’s cargo hangars are located in the aft of the ship. The one containing Sabetha’s cargo can be found deep down on the starboard side. A dirty armaglass window outside the door allows for a peek inside. A panel next to the door can be used when trying to hack the door’s lock, and gives access to the intercom system to communicate with people inside the hangar. The hangar is large and about three storys high to allow for unhindered use of large exos. Ladders connect to a walkway that circles the room. A crane system in the ceiling can be controlled from a panel at the foot of one of the stairs. Large posters with bright yellow safety notices in Zeni stress the use of proper equipment when loading and unloading. Three worn loader exos can be found next to the door. Sabetha’s cargo is stacked in the middle of the room and covered with a black tarp. A large hangar door allows spacecraft to dock directly with the hangar. The panel that controls the hangar door can also seal the inward-facing bulkhead door and depressurize the room. When this function is activated, a loud alarm goes off and warning lights begin to flash.</p><p>NPCS<br />Sabetha Pour can be found in the medlab, quietly chewing a cigarillo and keeping close watch of the unfolding events from a dark corner.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">SABETHA POUR, SMUGGLER</div>@Actor[Sabetha Pour, Smuggler]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Sebetha Pour06.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The events of the scene are described below.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EAVESDROPPING</h5><p>A fellow survivor (the GM decides who) overhears Sabetha’s conversation with the PCs.

The planet contains lush oasis gardens, extreme temperature variations, vast deserts, and a population with a soft spot for philosophy, mathematics, and beautiful mechanical creations.</p><p>Dabaran is a binary system, but Dabaran-B is so small that it can hardly be spotted on its fast course past the gigantic Dabaran-A. The main star is a red giant with a few satellites, and only the rock planet Dabaran has a sizeable population. There are some gas mines on the enormous Salamanx and a research installation on the boiling hot Arara.</p><h4>HOME OF THE DARS</h4><p>The arid Dabaran is home to a flourishing class of nobles living in oasis gardens, domed palaces and ravine seraglios. Regardless of whether they are emirs, feriks, pashas or sultans, nobles should be addressed using the royal prefix ”dar” or ”dari”, and the same term is used when speaking of their emirates. The dars are tangled up in a constant struggle to top one another in art, knowledge and wealth. The race for perfection assumes a variety of forms, from intricate mosaics and palaces to shining, mechanical nightingales and owls. Dabaran was mostly spared the horrors of the Portal Wars. The planet was not hit by any major bombardment, and the dars had no fleets with which to engage in the fighting. Concentrated efforts instead went into securing the planet’s self-sustainability, fortifying the oasis domes and stopping the spread of the contagious hate and suspicion that gripped the rest of the Horizon in a chokehold. In Lotus, the temple city, alliances and marriages were formed to safeguard the fragile peace and further progress and enlightenment.</p><p>The peace has lasted to this day, but the larger dars have begun competing for the planet’s most important resource – water. Water is rich in the lowlands around the equator, in underground springs and rivers, but the highlands, where many of the royal courts have their oasis domes, are dry, and water is something one must drill deep for. This has spawned a large and lucrative water rights market, with transactions in the form of either birr or marriage. More and more oasis domes are being constructed, and this has led to physical confrontations over wells and pipelines.</p><h4>ZENITHIAN ARROGANCE</h4><p>The Consortium, with Parr and the Colonial Agency at the forefront, has started to take an interest in the rich soils of the lowlands. With permission from emir Karabah of Lotus, several multi-farms have been founded on the slopes of the Yeva valley. Pumping stations and colossal crawlers are slowly taking over the valley – destroying it, according to many – and this has resulted in dust storms sweeping out towards the neighboring dars. Rumors have it that the Zenithians are attempting to drill their way into the Wound, which is located just north of the Yeva valley – why else would they have mobilized Parr-Nestera’s attack brigades?</p><h4>THE WOUND</h4><p>To the nobles of Dabaran, Lotus is the Icons' capital on the planet. It was constructed by the Seekers next to the mysterious Wound, a chasm whose volcanic depths have yet to be measured. The Wound is said to be of Portal Builder origin, but there have been no obvious artifact discoveries in the area that could prove it. Several expeditions have disappeared in the darkness of the Wound. To settle the matter once and for all, the Foundation recently sent a team of xeno-archaeologists to the site.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch13/segelpalats.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"iouXYTInNyi73z7m","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265768,"modifiedTime":1680376265768,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"L0xhU87YF6aWDPGJ"}

There can be no doubt about the fact that the Zenithian faction is the largest organization in the Horizon, but there is no shortage of aspiring usurpers either. The dethroning is coming. May the Icons have mercy.</div><br /><br /><div class=\"quoteAuthor\">IN THE SHADOW OF THE CONSORTIUM – POLITICAL LANDSCAPES OF THE THIRD HORIZON – Zidaldin Zou</div><hr /><h3>The Horizon is not dominated by a single power, but instead a wide range of groups struggle to claim the title – these are the factions. These monolithic organizations are divided into two groups, fighting economic, cultural, and military wars among each other to further their individual agendas.</h3><p><strong>The Horizon</strong> is full of large corporations, institutions and orders, but only a few – those with strong enough ancestry and political power – are called factions. Despite some disagreement on the issue, the general consensus is that there are ten active factions in the Horizon today, divided into two groups: Firstcome and Zenithian. The dividing line between the early colonists and the late-come Zenithians is the Third Horizon’s most prominent cultural conflict, taken to its extreme in the power play of the factions. The Firstcome share a strong belief in the Icons, while the Zenithians base their ideology on the austere pragmatism introduced by the arrival of their arkship, Zenith. There are some exceptions: the Church of the Icons is a young faction, but counts as Firstcome thanks to their strong religious foundation. The Legion on their hand have a Firstcome history, having fought together with the Order of the Pariah at Odacon, but counts as Zenithian because of their current alliance with the Consortium.</p><h4>ZENITHIAN FACTIONS</h4><p>The Zenithian factions, headed by the Consortium, all promote the pragmatic Zenithian culture and focus on function and effectiveness. They acknowledge the Icon faith, and many Zenithians have adopted the Icons as their gods, but view religion as something separate from politics and refuse to let the Icons influence their ideology. Their common goal is to consolidate their power in the Horizon and act as guardians and shepherds for the Zenithian peoples as they believe this to be the way into a new golden age.</p><p>The Zenithian factions have a natural leader in the Consortium, who through their myriad subsidiaries and trade networks have gathered riches and resources second to none. Thanks to their alliance with the Legion they also possess considerable military strength, dominating Coriolis and controlling large territories throughout the Horizon. Not all Zenithians are happy with their leadership, however – the proud Zenithian Hegemony regards themselves as the true rulers of the Zenithians and they are steadily growing stronger. The smallest factions, the Free League and the Syndicate, have less direct power on the political scene, but work with precision in the shadows, often together. They are also the most ideologically flexible of the Zenithian factions, open to negotiations and compromises for mutual benefit with the Firstcome factions.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>ZENITHIAN FACTIONS</h4><ul><li>The Consortium</li><li>The Free League</li><li>The Legion</li><li>The Syndicate</li><li>The Zenithian Hegemony</li></ul></div><h4>FIRSTCOME FACTIONS</h4><p>Unlike their Zenithian counterparts, the Firstcome factions place great belief in religious and mystical ideas about destiny and morality – in the legendary words of Icon Mother Saresha: “Without the Icons, the suns would go out. Without prayer, the Horizon would stop.” Faith and morality can be discussed just as intensely before drafting a new trade agreement as when debating whether or not humanites have souls. The Firstcome factions are known for their inability to agree with each other, often leaving it to the Zenithians to mediate between them. Only on one occasion have the Firstcome factions joined forces to achieve a common goal: when they crushed the Nazareem’s Sacrifice.</p><p>There is no obvious leader among the Firstcome factions, but as far as wealth and size goes, the Church of the Icons and the Order of the Pariah are the strongest. With the Order’s recent seclusion and the Church of the Icons lack of any real military strength, the Firstcome factions are more divided than ever.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/dabaran_honorguard_white.webp\" /></div><br /><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>FIRSTCOME FACTIONS</h4><ul><li>Ahlam’s Temple</li><li>The Draconites</li><li>The Church of the Icons</li><li>The Order of the Pariah</li><li>The Nomad Federation</li></ul></div><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>NAZAREEM’S SACRIFICE</h5><p>Factions are mighty, but not invincible. Nazareem’s Sacrifice was a cult-like faction of great power, until they were wiped out in a single, devastating blow and erased from the annals of the Horizon. Not much is known of this Firstcome faction, other than that they were hunted down by their brothers and sisters in the Order of the Pariah and the Draconites, supported by the other Firstcome factions and the Legion. The history of the Nazareem is more or less taboo to discuss, but there are of course many theories, most of which agree that the Nazareem turned to the Dark between the Stars, thus sentencing themselves to death.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/politiker_korridor.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar

The most basic technology is called primitive, found generally on the fringes of civilized space, in the lost colonies or with certain planetside nomads. The technology that came with the Zenith is called ordinary, and the same goes for most of the Firstcome tech. Spaceships, exo shells, and grav crafts are ordinary technology. The technology necessary for portal jumps, such as stasis beds and complex ship computers, is called advanced technology. The advanced tier also includes the different life lengthening inventions, such as bio sculpting, body part cloning, and certain cybernetics.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/tagg.webp\" /></div><p class=\"centerJournalText\">A tag</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>ITEMS EVERYBODY OWNS</h5><p>Some items can be found everywhere in the civilized parts of the Horizon. Beggars and slummers aside, most people have somewhere to live and food on their plates, plus common items like tags, transactors, and whatever gear they need for their profession. Transactors and tags are common methods of payment on Coriolis, on space stations, and in larger cities. The difference between the two is that a transactor is locked to its owner’s biocode while a tag is anonymous, only protected by a numeric code. Direct transfers between bank accounts are of course available in hubs like Coriolis, but other methods are required when one is out traveling. If an even higher level of anonymity is required, one can use physical birr, printed by the company banks, the factions and some of the royal courts. Birr are used for small purchases – using large sums of cash will look suspicious, and some systems have outlawed it all together. To gather information, take notes, or just to read the Bulletin’s news, merchants and other wealthy people use tabulas instead of actual paper. A tabula is a tablet in mimetic glass that can be operated by hand or using a fancy stylus pen.</p></div><h4>EVERYDAY TECHNOLOGY</h4><p>Inhabitants of the Third Horizon interact with ordinary technology every day, using devices such as tags, transactors, communicators, and tabulas. Only primitive tribes and backwater colonies lack this sort of tech.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>BIRR AND BIRR</h4><p>Birr is the currency of the Horizon, but is actually several different currencies mixed together. Electronic transactions are equal everywhere, but physical money – bills, Miran Icon coins, Algolan gem spheres – vary in worth depending on where you are. Locally, cash money is generally equivalent to tag-based birr, but this may not be true when you travel to another system. The peddler Erbulas learned this the hard way when he tried to purchase Kuan lumber using Algolan gem spheres – in the end he lost his ship, and the spheres became ballast on a river barge.</p></div><h4>TRAVEL AND SPACESHIPS</h4><p>Travel, once reserved for a select few, is now blooming across all the systems. Planetside transportation varies between the worlds – people use river barges on Kua, shuttles on Dabaran, and trains on Sadaal, for example. Before the Zenithians opened up the Horizon again, there were only a handful of spaceships in operational condition, and they belonged to larger powers such as the Order, royal courts in the fringe systems, or to ruthless corsairs. Interplanetary trade was rare and existed in only a few systems. The new era is boiling with free traders. The most heavily trafficked route is that between Mira and Dabaran, a trip the bulk haulers make regularly each segment. Big cruise liners with thousands of stasis beds follow the same route, but not as often, maybe once per triad. Yachts, pleasure sloops, and emirs’ cruisers carry rich passengers between safaris and exotic shopping on distant worlds, but the masses travel for business or for their faith. Pilgrims make up a large portion of the Horizon’s travelers.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/dockning_varv_sadaal_horisonten.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>ARRCA STELLAR A&amp;W division</h5><p>The Arrca Stellar Archaeology and Weapons Division – commonly just “Arrca” – is an offshoot of the Foundation’s regular science divisions. The Arrca institute’s origins are somewhat mysterious, possibly indicating that the Special Branch might have been involved in its founding. Exactly what research they conduct and who their clients are is also unclear, but the corporate emir, Davo par-Allalti, is often seen in the company of Consortium factionaries, and the new Arrca base in Awadhi is under the protection of the Legion fleet. Arrca is generally considered the source of much of the Horizon’s advanced technology.</p><p>The faction technology is even more complex and usually kept secret. Examples of this tech are the antimatter rockets of the Order of the Pariah, the Draconites’ meson weapons, and the experimental giant exos being developed by the Consortium. The last technology tier is the glyphs and artifacts left behind by the Portal Builders – everything from sugar globes and healing scarabs to the soletta in Menkar or the fusion spheres of Anaspora. Some Portal Builder technology is entirely incomprehensible and hints at an alien physiognomy.</p></div><h4>COMMUNICATION</h4><p>To communicate in a city or on a station, most people use messengers, or communicators if they can afford them. Space stations have relay transmitters onboard that make sure all communicators can reach each other, as long as their users have the identification codes necessary to find the intended receiver. Newer cities usually have enough relays to make communicators fairly reliable, although the variation between cities or systems can be big. Supposedly, Lord Yionid pas-Dasmaku had to wait three whole days to get an audience with the matriarch of Mira because his communicator was unable to reach the guard towers in the Icon City.</p><h4>TERMINALS AND THE NET</h4><p>On Coriolis and in cities with a strong Consortium presence, you will find the Bulletin’s terminals, connected through the encrypted infonet. Notable exceptions include Karrmerruk on Zalos, the City of Prophets in Alburz, and some of the more conservative dars on Dabaran. The infonet can also be used by computers, tabulas, and advanced transactors for information sharing, data storage or birr transactions. The Syndicate has just started to realize that the infonet is a new arena for profit making. Apart from the infonet, smaller networks using power lines or relay towers exist in the modern districts of Algol, Mira, and Dabaran, as well as on larger space stations such as Djachroum. These networks are usually less reliable than the Bulletin’s infonet. The Algolan Zou bank was declared bankrupt a few cycles ago after an overload in the AYM network fried the intelligence that administered all of the bank’s transactions.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>INTELLIGENCES AND THE NET</h5><p>Scientists from the Foundation, the Daddah institute, and other elite academies have developed advanced intelligences that can control ships, drones, and other complex systems. Their inventions are based on old ship intelligences from Firstcome ships and from the Zenith. According to a hypothesis presented by the mathematician Ibrahim Hadrogas, these intelligences will spontaneously evolve into true intelligences equal to humans and humanites. This will also, Hadrogas argues, result in them getting a ghost or soul, which is the essence of being human according to the Church of the Icons. Networks such as the infonet are what will act as a catalyst for the intelligences, says Hadrogas. This worries some orthodox believers and several info terminals on Algol, among other places, have been vandalized.</p></div><h4>NEWS AND COURIERS</h4><p>News has always been distributed by word of mouth in the Horizon. Nomads, merchants, or tarrabs all spread the news on their travels, albeit for different reasons. The larger cities have newspapers, either in printed form or on tabulas. When the systems began communicating again, the free traders were the first to start spreading news and rumors between systems, but it was the Bulletin which really organized interstellar communication when it started supplying the portal stations with their probes. Their ownership of the probes also means that they are the ones who determine which news to spread. The probes go through the portals, and relays on the other side transmit the data to new probes by the next portal, and so on. This way, the news is spread through roughly one system per day, at least along the route between Mira and Dabaran. Farther out, where the portal stations are less secure, information is usually recorded on tags and carried by free traders or the Ermes Courier, the Bulletin’s own courier service. Sending mail is generally a slow affair. With a chain of free traders eventually getting from sender to receiver, a package usually takes a week, sometimes a whole segment, to arrive at its destination. For speedy deliveries, one must hire a fast courier vessel, an Ermes ship perhaps, or one of the many other players on the courier market. Couriers are costly but fast, usually making it through a system in two days.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE BULLETIN’S COM BASE</h4><p>So, how does a communicator work? Personal communicators have specific codes that the caller must know in order to reach you. Some communicators are linked to the bio code of their owners, and newer ones may even be voice operated, like computers. Com codes are usually delivered in person or on tags via messengers. On Coriolis, the Bulletin supplies a registry on its infonet where com codes may be stored through any info terminal. Similar code bases can be found in most larger cities or stations where the Bulletin has a network of terminals in place, such as AYM, the main districts of the Conglomerate, the Icon City, Dar Bahri, and Alburz, to name a few. The wealthy have personal couriers to send messages in cities or on stations, sometimes even off world. This type of courier services can usually be bought from freelancers as well. Dignitaries and the very rich can also afford the powerful planetary or system communicators, with the latter working even in systems without satellite relays.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"N5gquYQ8JoaIs9qI","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266335,"modifiedTime":1680376266335,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"Ld1yBgd19oynz4XR"}

The trapped group have air for a few more hours, but have run out of everything else, and find themselves without any way out of their situation.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>A coughing burst of static comes through the intercom. A distorted voice breaks through, at first muffled, but suddenly loud and clear: “This is Koria Yohares, can anybody hear me? We are trapped in the chapel and we can’t get out. We can’t reach the escape pods, we have no exos, we are running out of air. Can anybody hear me?” The voice is calm, tired. Crying and mumbled prayers can be heard in the background. The message fades into static again. If the PCs have stepped up as leaders during the evacuation process, they will be expected to do something to help the trapped group. Large sections of the outer hull around the chapel have been ruptured or torn off, destroying all nearby escape pods and docked ships. The only way to rescue the trapped survivors is to undertake a hazardous spacewalk to reach the chapel airlock.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs can find out which of the Ghazali’s airlocks are still functional by asking Suleiman (see the ship plan on page 6). The trapped passengers have no exos, but the PCs find four intact suits near the airlock on their side. There are fourteen people trapped in the chapel, meaning that five spacewalks will be required to get everyone out (one person going back with the three empty exos each time to escort the others to safety). The first trip must be performed by a PC, after which other passengers can take over. Each walk back and forth equates to one scene worth of time. The difficult part is the first crossing, reaching the chapel airlock to attach a guide cable. The walk is about a hundred meters across a section of the hull where cracked pieces might come loose. Reaching the chapel airlock requires a successful dexterity test. Failure adds one scene worth of time to the fastening of the cable per failed attempt. During the spacewalk, a number of things can go wrong (see Events below). Should the PCs ignore the message from Koria Yohares and word of this gets out, they suffer a –2 to all further manipulation tests. Komoro Vai is automatically informed of their cowardice and will try to use it to his advantage.</p><h4>REACHING THE CHAPEL AIRLOCK</h4><p>The chapel is located at the top of the ship and a wide panoramic window allows for a view of the void. The extensive damage suffered by the Ghazali has isolated the chapel, making it reachable only by a spacewalk. The nearest airlock can be found in the residential area, putting the distance at about a hundred meters.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AIRLOCK/EXO STORAGE</h5><p>An airlock at the top of the ship for access to maintenance stations on the hull. The four exo suits found here enable the PCs to spacewalk over to the chapel. A winch with a hundred and fifty meters of cable is located next to the outer airlock door. A spacefarer fastened to the cable can be pulled back to safety should something go wrong during the EVA.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AIRLOCK AND CORRIDOR</h5><p>An airlock high up on the liner near the bow. A short corridor leads to the stairs that connect to the chapel.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STAIRCASE</h5><p>A spiral staircase connecting the two floors.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ANTECHAMBER</h5><p>A small room reached before entering the chapel. Embroidered tapestries on the walls depict important events from the history of the Ghazali when the Icons interceded on the crew’s behalf. There are benches along the right wall, and a silver washbowl on a marble pillar to the left. A compartment in the pillar contains an empty clay jug.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CHAPEL</h5><p>A circular chamber containing statues of the eight visible Icons. A polished altar sits in the center of the room. An empty alcove in the wall is located behind the altar, slightly off-center. The trapped survivors huddle together in prayer around the altar. The PCs can pray here for guidance, but it will cost them an hour’s worth of time.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Ikonernas-kapell03.webp\" /></div><h4>NPCS</h4><p>The trapped survivors in the chapel.

The reconfiguration of their ship’s computer is too slow however, and the air in the chapel will run out if they wait. If the PCs go for this option, Koria manages to send a another message after a while, saying that they are running out of time…</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SPACEWALK</h5><p>A PC must climb along the hull of the Ghazali to reach the chapel airlock. A number of things might go wrong during the crossing. As the GM, you may spend DP to activate the events below, but you may wish to do so only during the first walk, and save some of the events for when they spacewalk to the bridge later (see below).

{"name":"Important Facts About Coriolis","flags":{"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true},"coriolis-corerules":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/11 - Coriolis","noteRef":""},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-corerules.journalentry.e4469c5ab9e03fe4"}},"pages":[{"name":"Important Facts About Coriolis","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>If you are new to the station, Coriolis will offer plenty of sights and activities, but there are a few things all new arrivals should know.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>BIRR AND CASH</h4><p>Monetary transactions on Coriolis are usually handled electronically, by using tags, although smaller payments can of course be made in cash. It is wise to have two tags: one for information (licenses, addresses, insurances, medical records, etc.) and one for your money. A transactor is a safer medium if you wish to keep everything in one place as it is locked to your biocode – ordinary tags are only protected by a numeric code.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE INFO TERMINALS</h4><p>The info terminals on Coriolis supply people on the station with all sorts of useful information, and they are veritable gold mines to a data spider. All information on the infonet will sooner or later leak out, even private messages from forums and password protected areas. The factions’ communications use the same network but generally have stronger encryption. The station’s security and defense systems run on a separate encrypted network that can only be accessed by the terminals inside Administrative Services, the headquarters of the Guard, and a few other places. Attempts to get at this information are criminal acts and will trigger swift reprisal from the Judicators.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>WORK</h4><p>Anyone is free to come and work on Coriolis, but to gain access to basic health care you need to purchase a work permit. These are supplied by Administrative Services in the Core at a cost of 100 birr per CC.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>BUSINESS</h4><p>There are no mandatory taxes on Coriolis, but if you wish to start a business, you need to pay for a business license. The license must be renewed every cycle, and the cost depends on the type of your business.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>HOUSING</h4><p>If you intend to stay on the station for a longer period of time, renting a room or a module in a family-run boarding house would be a good idea. As the small businesses generally cannot afford any holo or modulate advertising, they can be tricky to find compared to regular hotels. Staying in a hotel for more than a few days will be very expensive however, unless you choose one of the cheap coffin-style hotels common in the spaceports. Buying your own living module is expensive, but a very good investment.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/bostäder_horisonten.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>LAW AND ORDER</h4><p>The laws of the station is enforced by the Coriolis Guard who answers to the Governor. For serious crimes, there is a special division, the Judicators, who work directly under the criminal courts. Both the Guard and the Judicators are mandated to sentence criminals at the scene for a number of crimes. The Guard can order corporal punishments such as whippings or public humiliation. The Judicators can order public mutilations and also sentence someone to death, if they can justify it. Incarceration on the station is always short and reserved for cases of public intoxication or lunacy. Longer sentences are served in forced labor camps on Kua. Fines are common, often in addition to other punishment. Suicide is a crime that leads to confiscation of all assets to prevent people from indebting themselves and then committing suicide to save their families from repossession.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>HEALTH CARE</h4><p>Through the work permit you have access to several private medical facilities on the station. There are usually block doctors in the larger residential areas. Those without a work permit can visit the Samaritan Sanatorium and its adjacent hospital.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SPIRITUALITY</h4><p>Icon chapels can be found everywhere across the station and the preachers there are at your service in exchange for some small gift. The Church of the Icons can also help you in their Dome in the Core, but reserve more extensive aid for their members. Membership is free, however.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TRANSPORTATION</h4><p>Most people in the center of the station use the Ring tube for longer stretches of transportation. The tube runs around the Ring and into the Core through each of the four spokes. There are five tube stations, one on each of the Ring plazas, and one in the Core. Hover taxis are more expensive but can take you anywhere in the Core, on the Ring or up to the Spire, via the grav shafts. Private vehicles require their owners to purchase expensive vehicle licenses. Bikes, rickshaws, and palanquins are license-free, but ground loaders, grav chairs, and grav craft are not. Crawlers are only allowed on the station for sanitation and transport companies, and for the Guard and the Judicators.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>WEAPON LAWS AND SELF-DEFENSE</h4><p>All weapons require licenses that cost the same amount as the weapon itself, per year. Heavier weaponry and weapon systems are not allowed on the station. Persons convicted of violent crimes cannot purchase weapon licenses. The self-defense laws of the station state that everyone has the right to defend themselves and their property from an attack, but that the defensive violence should be proportionate to the threat. It is rare for someone to be found guilty of excessive use of force however, unless the person used an illegal weapon.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SIGHTS</h4><p>Coriolis is a wondrous sight in its own right, but a visit to the Dome of the Icons is recommended if you wish to experience something out of the ordinary. The Foundation’s Museum of History and the Spire Plaza are must-sees. Careful advanced planning could also land you a reservation to Alkamaar’s.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>HOLIDAYS AND FESTIVALS</h4><p>There are three major holidays on Coriolis: the Founding, the Cyclade, and the Pilgrimaria. The Founding is a celebration of the construction of the station, the establishing of the office of the Governor, and the formation of the Council of Factions. The celebrations are station-wide with food, music, and dancing. In the evening, there is a remembrance ceremony on the Spire Plaza for those who have died defending the station, members of the GuardS and the Judicators, as well as Governors and civilians. The Cyclade is the celebration of the new cycle and contains a variety of events and competitions. The parties are even bigger than during the Founding and the night traditionally ends with a huge concert in the Core. An informal tradition for many is to party all the way around the Ring during the day and then end the night in the Core. The Pilgrimaria is a calmer holiday. The day should be devoted to prayer and reflection. The queues for the Dome grow long already during the night watch of the day before. Processions carrying Icon statues pass along the Promenade with much pomp during the day. The day usually ends with a big dinner for family and friends.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/besökare_coriolis.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>HOW TO BLEND IN ON CORIOLIS</h4><ul><li>Support the Governor, the Council of Factions and the will of the people.</li><li>Accept diversity, and understand that through this, others will accept you.</li><li>Praise the Icons and give proper sacrifice before important decisions and as thanks for a blessed life.

From the top down they are the Spire, the Core, and the Ring. Each part has its own distinctive style and atmosphere, but the friendly and welcoming Coriolis residents are everywhere. The three parts are described below, from the point of view of the arriving traveler.</h3><h1>The Ring</h1><hr /><p>The Ring of the station is huge, and running along its whole extent is the Promenade, the bustling street of boutiques and shops that characterizes Coriolis. The Promenade is best accessed from one of the four plazas located where each of the four spokes connect to the Ring. Taking a taxi or a grav chair is an excellent way to get there, if you can pay. The Promenade is usually very crowded, making grav chairs, rickshaws, or walking the best modes of transportation.</p><h4>NEOPTRA SPACEPORT</h4><p>The largest of the four commercial spaceports on Coriolis is the Neoptra, located on the Ring just below the Spice Plaza. Each of the plazas connects to one of four larger spaceports, but there are many private ports as well, especially in the Spire. The Neoptra is usually the first impression a visitor gets of Coriolis, and the current Governor has had it modernized and renovated with shining floors in white Kuan marble and beautiful bas-reliefs on the sturdy pillars that support the many balconies that make up the space port’s different levels. The outer parts are still kept practical of course, strictly armanite bulkheads and riveted plating. Inside the crescent-shaped balconies that follow the arch of the outer hull is a large terminal full of small cantinas, shops, market stalls, and carts – a sort of miniature of the larger plazas. The terminal has several large exits with security checkpoints and three customs stations. Customs officers and members of the Guard keep close tabs of everyone entering or leaving the station – travel papers are scanned with tabulas and luggage is inspected. The customs station is where you pay for weapon licenses and livestock or semi-intelligences import fees, and they can be used as quarantine stations in the event of disease. There are heavily reinforced bulkheads between the customs stations and the rest of the station that can be closed in case of a threat, but they have never been used so far.</p><p>Many of Coriolis’ residents work in the Neoptra port, and some even live there – beggars, courtesans, and one or two prophets. The port is also frequented by several chambalas, con artists who make their living pestering naïve travelers. The balcony at the very top of the port is called the Balustrade. Fancy ships that can’t afford their own private docks use this level, which also houses a walkway with a mighty view of Kua through a sapphire glass window, like a lush, green sun in the emptiness.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>MISSING CARGO</h5><p>During the last few segments, cargo has gone missing from the warehouses below Stevedore Central, usually small quantities of luxuries such as fresh foods or delicacies. No one knows who the thief is, but one of the stevedore aqbars, Xiu XiCharma from Lubau, has been tasked with finding out. She has been unsuccessful so far and is considering looking for external help. The skavara Rauw, the stevedores’ mascot and lucky charm, has also gone missing – is it all somehow connected?</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.1 ENCOUNTERS IN THE SPACEPORT</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.1 Encounters in the Spaceport]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Rawa</td><td>Stevedore</td><td>Sweaty</td><td>Searching</td><td>Love</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Dafor</td><td>Guard</td><td>Scratches nose</td><td>Has a job to do</td><td>Sweet, sweet birr</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Ibramir</td><td>Street peddler</td><td>Rolls eyes</td><td>In a hurry</td><td>A secret</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Mirah</td><td>Traveler</td><td>Nervous</td><td>Looking for a bargain</td><td>Debt</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Zarah</td><td>Street preacher</td><td>Angry</td><td>Preaching loudly</td><td>Salvation</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Absalem</td><td>Merchant</td><td>Smells of arrash</td><td>Looking for an opportunity</td><td>Living true</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STEVEDORE CENTRAL</h5><p>Below the ground floor of the spaceport runs the maze of corridors and loading bays used for storage and distribution of imported goods, commonly known as Stevedore Central. The slightly larger bays used by the loaders who work the Net are also found here. Stevedore Central is shot through with crawlways, ladders, and vent shafts running like ant trails below the spaceport. The stevedores who work here can find their way through these secret passages and get between the loading bays and the port above, but an outsider would become lost almost immediately.</p><h4>THE PROMENADE</h4><p>The Promenade is a walkway running along the entire Ring, full of both living modules and shops. Family-run businesses are common, and many people live where they work, or close by. The Promenade itself is wide, with high ceilings, almost reaching the top of the Ring. Bridges, wires, and the occasional grav chair cross between the walls above the crowd as some of the higher levels have balconies with smaller walkways, shops and cafés. Public transportation in the Ring exists in the form of the Ring tube, a fast cablecar service. There is a tube station at each of the four plazas as well as one in the Core. The tickets to go through the Core are more expensive, so most people prefer to go half a lap around the Ring if they need to get to the other side.</p><p>The living modules on the Ring are small, rarely larger than two rooms for a big family sleeping in shifts. The living modules form a mosaic of criss-crossing stairs, balconies, balustrades and rope bridges above the Promenade, crowded with people going about their daily chores, children playing, and dogs and monkeys jumping around. Clotheslines share the airspace with beautiful fabric roofs over balconies, and the noise and chatter from the Promenade below can be heard at all hours.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/Promenaden_Coriolis.webp\" /></div><p class=\"centerJournalText\">Everything can be bought for birr on The Promenade</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>LOCATIONS AND SERVICES IN THE SPACEPORT</h4><ul><li>The infirmary run by the medicurg Leio</li><li>The “Journey’s End” cantina, famous for its shish kabab</li><li>The Free League’s exchange and bank office, where birr and travel currency can be bought</li><li>The “Oasis” courtesan and massage salon, owned by the madrigga Ahia</li><li>An Icon chapel</li><li>The cargo blocks, storage units for light cargo awaiting customs inspection</li><li>Guard point 13, where captain Karou oversees spaceport security</li><li>Giakovo’s kawah trolley, with fresh ground kawah</li><li>Customs point 1, where weapon licenses are acquired</li><li>The shuttle service Monolith Round-trips, offering quick but expensive transport from the Balustrade</li></ul></div><h4>THE SPICE PLAZA</h4><p>As hinted by the name, the Spice Plaza is the place for all forms of spice trade on Coriolis, but the marketplace also hosts a wide variety of fruit and vegetable vendors. The Spice Plaza offers exotic flavors from all corners of the Horizon, but especially from Kua: fresh bananas, shiny green melons, mangos, burs, hevon fruit, dried figs and dates, coconut, fresh moist cinnamon, nuts, and almonds. The tiny stalls display beautiful trays of deep red paprika, intense saffron, peppers in every color, chili powder, and cumin seeds. Foreign spice mixes from near and far are introduced into the Kuan cuisine via the Spice Plaza: Algolan kurrah, berberi mix from Lubau, smoked paprika from Sadaal, and many others. Bakeries, pastry shops, baklava carts, and honey trolleys surround the plaza on all sides. Baklava and other filo-based pastries are the main products sold here, and even people from the wealthy Spire come here for a taste of Saba Khouri’s masterful baking. Every year there is a bake-off on the plaza, the Baklava Championship, to which bakers from Kua as well as from systems farther away come to compete. Spices, syrup, and the proper amount of cloves, sourness or more exotic ingredients like stone licorice, smoked kas-myrrh, or ginger flowers are the topics of lively debate and heated arguments.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.2 ENCOUNTERS ON THE SPICE PLAZA</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.2 Encounters on the Spice Plaza]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Yosoufa</td><td>Khabara (broker)</td><td>Looking for a profit</td><td>Having a bad day</td><td>A contract</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Melkar</td><td>Animal trader</td><td>Wrinkled</td><td>Looking for a runaway animal</td><td>Finding a lost protégé</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Simah</td><td>Pastry chef</td><td>Proud</td><td>On a delivery</td><td>Renown</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Nastassia</td><td>Baker</td><td>Clicks tongue</td><td>Is baking something</td><td>A win</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Hewul</td><td>Servant</td><td>Chews lip</td><td>Carrying an important package</td><td>Obedience</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>White Eye</td><td>Ekilibri</td><td>Huggy</td><td>Looking for food</td><td>The pack</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIVESTOCK AND PETS</h5><p>At the side of the plaza you will find a few large buildings, almost like hangars, full of all sorts of cages and enclosures. This is Coriolis’ famous livestock market, where large livestock auctions are held once a week. A smaller market for semi-intelligences is located on the lower levels that connect to the Kasitra freighter port. Nekatra and ekilbri are most common here but on rare occasions shipments of skavara will pass through. Yasmian’s Pets is a small pet store adjacent to the livestock market. Yasmian markets just about every pet and animal companion there is, from Tersinian snuggle mice, feather snakes, Algolan dogs, and parrots to song finch, white thrush, sloi fish, and coral carp. Pet food and beautifully adorned cages and aquariums are available as well, and direct transport from the store can be arranged.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  SOUK ALESH</h5><p>The station’s official free trader market, the Souk Alesh, is located just off the Spice Plaza, in the outer blocks of the Ring. The Souk’s warehouses and docks cover several floors, but the public face of the operation looks roughly like a large bazaar, full of brokers, so-called khabara, loudly yelling out their cargos and missions.</p><h4>THE SPRING PLAZA</h4><p>The crown jewel of the Spring Plaza is the magnificent fountain at its center. The fountain was gifted to the people of Coriolis by dar Bahari, and its gentle babble lends a soothing calm to the nearby cantinas, kawah shops, and taverns. The Spring Plaza is not only a marketplace for exotic goods, but also for ideas. Poets, prophets, tarrabs, writers, and many others from the world of the arts gather here. Cafés like Osmano’s, Leverte’s, and Buthro’s are hotspots for discussions about politics, factionary gossip, or the latest holo dramas from the Bulletin. The discussions blend with open agitation from opinion makers and chanting from prophets and preachers as well as with the latest shows and performances by acrobats, fire-eaters, or painters. When the evening watch begins and the holo sky above the plaza darkens, lanterns are lit, sugar globes are submerged in jars of colored syrup, and the grills are prepared for the evening meal. The goods marketed on the Spring Plaza are mainly of an artistic nature: paintings, sculptures, Algolan paper birds, clay hydras from Sadaal, clock birds from Dabaran, and autonomous abaci from the polytechnicians on Aiwaz mixed with miniature Algolan prayer towers, Icon mosaics from distant Eanu, prayer beads carved by the eternally patient monks in the dusty temples on Amedo, and reliquaries smuggled out from Zalos, maybe even containing the bones of one of the famous martyred holy warriors.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.3 ENCOUNTERS ON THE SPRING PLAZA</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.3 Encounters on the Spring Plaza]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Loma</td><td>Acrobat</td><td>Full-body tattoos</td><td>Putting on a show</td><td>Fame</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Samrat</td><td>Historian</td><td>Scratches beard</td><td>Is in doubt</td><td>Academic honesty</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Koanah</td><td>Writer</td><td>Smells of myrrh</td><td>Doing research</td><td>The next book</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Almaki</td><td>Poet</td><td>Intense stare</td><td>Reciting poems</td><td>Vengeance</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Hamsha</td><td>Singer</td><td>Covered in bells</td><td>Flirts</td><td>Birr</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Mouno</td><td>Archaeologist</td><td>Stressed</td><td>Searching</td><td>An artifact</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  ARCHAEOLOGY ALLEY</h5><p>Archaeology Alley is an arc-shaped alley that connects to the Spring Plaza and is crammed full of strange and curious finds for sale – sometimes replicas, but real sugar globes and sometimes even healing scarabs or infinito cubes can be found here. It is illegal to trade in unregistered finds, but rumors say that robber diggers use the Alley to unload their ill-gotten gains. Portal Builder items and unidentified objects are strictly forbidden in the Alley, and judicators often pass through here to keep an eye on the operation. The Alley’s many antiques dealers, bookshops, and curiosity shops close when the evening watch begins, their owners and customers continuing their debating and haggling in cafés such as Burhan’s or Farid’s on the Spring Plaza over the comforting purr of the hookahs.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE STAIRDOM</h5><p>The block between the Spring Plaza and the inner bend of the Ring belongs to the artists and poets. It is a towering complex of living modules painted in bright colors with splashes of white here and there, in the fashion of the whitewashed sanctuaries on Amedo. Between the sloping roofs, porches, balconies, and ledges runs a tangled network of stairs and ladders. If you need a poet or perhaps an artist, this is where to go, but be careful not to get lost.</p><h4>THE MARKET PLAZA</h4><p>The common people of Coriolis visit the Market Plaza to do their daily shopping or just to meet up with friends. From the day watch onwards, the many cantinas and taverns open their doors. Grills are lit, the shish kabab is put on rotation, and the nicer places prepare lamb, rabbit, or byrro for spit roasting. Taverns such as Ila’s, Samira’s, and Rayhan’s are packed full already at lunchtime, so one has to be quick to get a table. Smiling old men, wrinkled ladies, and bearded wabas come early to the taverns to play tavli, shah, or other dice and board games. The plaza also houses many smokehouses, and the smell of smoked meat, fish, sausages, greens, and spices is heavy all over. The wine houses Fidon, Hemerra, and Qui-Nestera have several wine cantinas on the plaza where soothing rosé or hot chamba is served depending on the season. Fudaila’s cantina in Jasmine alley is among the most popular, and its small balcony surrounded by thick, climbing jasmine is always full. The tabak isle on the plaza is the place for all things tabak-, cigar-, or hookah-related. To the connoisseur, dol-Hassan’s Tabakery is the number one location, mostly thanks to their divine cherry blends.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>TURF WAR</h5><p>A series of fires have recently plagued the Market Plaza and the nearby Promenade. The Guard has had to dispatch their fire drone almost every day. The ventilation systems are set to full effect, but everyone is coughing and the smell of smoke still lingers. The spokesperson for the plaza vendors, Hasman Erbul, has written a letter to the Governor demanding an end to the gangs’ turf war, as it is widely accepted that this is the cause of the fires. Everybody knows that both the Arhama and the Goro gangs are challenging the Wark for control of the Market Plaza, but all three outfits deny having anything to do with the fires. Is there a pyromaniac on the station?</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.4 ENCOUNTERS ON THE MARKET PLAZA</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.4 Encounters on the Market Plaza]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Uwana</td><td>Peddler</td><td>Wrinkled</td><td>Smiling smoothly</td><td>Survival</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Ithane</td><td>Waiter</td><td>Pleasantly perfumed</td><td>Working</td><td>Her children</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Lippo</td><td>Waba</td><td>Twitchy</td><td>Shop-lifting</td><td>Thrills</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Poharo</td><td>Storyteller</td><td>Toothless grin</td><td>Smoking a hookah</td><td>To entertain</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Kam-kam</td><td>Tourist</td><td>Wide-eyed</td><td>Shopping</td><td>See the Horizon</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Grrrah</td><td>Skavara</td><td>Angry</td><td>On the run</td><td>Freedom!</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>THE OZONE PLAZA</h4><p>The market in the Ozone Plaza is dedicated to technological gizmos and gadgets, big and small. Loud bartering from the many tents and stalls mingles with the hoarse laughter from off-duty Legionnaires, the purring hookahs, and the rhythmic chinking from the sequin dresses of the belly dancers. Many visitors to the plaza are more or less openly armed, which is uncommon anywhere else on the station. The Guard avoids the Ozone Plaza and instead one will spot patrols from the Lama gang moving arrogantly about the place, distinguishable by their black-tattooed lips. A judicator or two will occasionally come down here to keep an eye on things.</p><p>The Ozone Plaza is the place to go for all your technological needs – and, despite the name, the air in the plaza is actually quite pleasant. The workshops here can make repairs to all kinds of gear, as well as make modifications. The best artisans on the station can be found on the Ozone Plaza, especially when it comes to gunsmithing. If one has the proper contacts one can even place an order with a real court appointed gunsmith. Weapons bought here cannot always be claimed right away, heavier weapons and ammunition are kept in storage in the spaceports. The buyer gets a tag with the codes to unlock a storage module and can pick up the goods on departure from the station.</p><p>In the alleys around the plaza there are several mercenary agencies, with the Black Skull being the most famous. These agencies supply mercenary groups to clients in need of personnel for small security or combat missions. A few detective agencies and investigative freelancers also have offices here, such as the Under the Lotus firm, specialized in extramarital affairs and other indiscretions.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/torg_coriolis.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">The Ozone Plaza</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.5 ENCOUNTERS ON THE OZONE PLAZA</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.5 Encounters on the Ozone Plaza]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Shamzad</td><td>Thug</td><td>White makeup</td><td>Glaring</td><td>Status</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Ewanje</td><td>Tattoo artist</td><td>Fluorescent tattoos</td><td>Drinking</td><td>Debt</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Okane</td><td>Enforcer</td><td>Huge</td><td>On a job</td><td>Pride</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Kamriza</td><td>Legionnaire</td><td>Cybernetic eye</td><td>On guard</td><td>The comrades in the Legion</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Chikchik</td><td>Macaque</td><td>Chatters</td><td>Picking pockets</td><td>Loot</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Yala</td><td>Smuggler</td><td>Baggy clothes</td><td>Searching</td><td>Birr!</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  GABRIL’S AMMO</h5><p>The elderly one-eyed Legionnaire Gabril is one of the best arms traders on the plaza. Together with his friend and technician Irin and their not-so-housebroken pet macaque Bang, Gabril trades in everything from special ammunition to bespoken firearms. His most well-known creation is the Legion carbine Inferno, which has its built-in grenade launcher replaced with a compact flamethrower.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE BIOSCULPTORS’ BLOCK</h5><p>One of the blocks adjacent to the Ozone Plaza holds several famous biosculptor studios, or “slaughterhouses” as they are commonly called. Bionics and cybernetics are available here for those with the birr and the courage. Everything from cosmetic grafts to prostheses and more subtle code splicing such as micro glands, hidden compartments, night eyes, or double hearts can be arranged. The largest studio is CharibaTechne, a large building with many operating rooms, T-suites and rejuvats, as well as recovery wards for more extensive procedures. Kasma Cosmetics is the jet set studio on the block, always up to date on the latest fashion – some even say that it is Madame Kasma herself who creates the fashion.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  TATTOO ALLEY</h5><p>An alley just next to the bio sculptor’s block has been labeled “Tattoo alley” - not because it is the only place on the station where you can get some ink work done, but because it is the most well-known. The studios in the alley offer ink tattoos, scarifications, henna painting, or modern things like moto tattoos that move or glow. The tattoo artist Ameda from Amedo is perhaps the most popular artist in the alley. She is well traveled, speaks several languages and has mastered the skill of micro tattoos, no bigger than the edge of a fingertip.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"1Pgc0A2Ju8ebJC1f","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3,"6Di8yMnm3jtdNeRI":2},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.3.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266817,"modifiedTime":1684524707306,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"wz390mVwR1sEKuel","sort":0,"_id":"NOeUCONcPStfJ7wZ"}

Emissary Lost tells the tragic tale of the Emissary on Coriolis, the Horizon’s growing mystic population, and the deadly conspiracy targeting them both.</h3><p><strong>Emissary Lost</strong> is made up of two scenarios, <em>The Wake of the Martyr</em> and <em>The Kuan Connection</em>. It is a thrilling story full of intrigue and action, leaving plenty of room for the group to make it their own. They will gradually get to know the Third Horizon as the campaign takes them far from home to see new places and experience new things. Emissary Lost establishes the PCs' involvement in the Mercy of the Icons arc and introduces important NPCs, themes, and events that will return throughout the campaign. The background to the events in Mercy of the Icons is described below, some of which will become known to the PCs as they start to unravel the secrets surrounding the abductions of the mystics and the Emissary on Coriolis.</p><h4>BACKGROUND</h4><p>The story begins when infiltrators serving the Eternal Emperor of the First Horizon finally break through to the Third Horizon via the portals in the Taoan system.</p><h4>THE FALL OF TAOAN</h4><p>The events that eventually warranted the ultimately unsuccessful rescue mission to Taoan are at the core of the dark tide that is about to wash over the Third Horizon once more. The portals between the First Horizon and the Taoan system are not dead, only sleeping, and they are about to wake up. Their short windows of stability are rare and unpredictable, but the great enemy on the other side has launched ship after ship into the darkness between the stars, until finally one vessel made it through – a white, butterfly-shaped ship, sneaking up on the unsuspecting Taoan mining colony. The goals of the First Horizon invaders are clear: prepare the Third Horizon for a swift take-over, ideally without too much bloodshed. Hidden survivors from the cult of Nazareem’s Sacrifice are to spread chaos and fear to destabilize the factions and local governments, after which the fleets of the First Horizon will show up to restore order, peace, and stability. A violent invasion will only be necessary if the efforts of the Nazareem’s Sacrifice fail, and open hostilities would have to be short and brutal – all of the Emperor’s forces are needed in the ever-raging war against the Second Horizon and the Symmetry.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE GHAZALI</h5><p>The attack on the Taoan mining colony was a brilliant success except for one thing – the colony managed to transmit a distress call. When the mining station had been converted, the invaders set out to find the surviving members of Nazareem’s Sacrifice and ran into the ships dispatched for the rescue mission. When the Legion destroyer Zafirah was entering the portal fields in the Hamura system, she was attacked by The White Butterfly in the darkness between the portals. The destroyer was defeated but managed to send a warning back to the repurposed cruise ship Ghazali before the portal field detonated. A powerful energy blast hit the Ghazali, knocking her off course, with a trajectory towards Hamura’s unforgiving star.</p><h4>THE ORDER’S PROPHECY</h4><p>The Order of the Pariah is an ancient cult, its origins lost in time, but with many teachings and values that stem from long before the Portal Wars isolated the Third Horizon. The devastation caused by the Wars destroyed much of the Third Horizon’s history. The Order hurled everything they had against their enemies in the final battles in the Odacon system and won, but suffered terrible losses. The remnants of the victorious fleet rose from the ashes, celebrating the glorious dead and piecing together their shattered history – much had been destroyed, insights that should never have been forgotten were lost forever.</p><p>The Order of today carves old prophecies and prayers on temple walls and ship hulls – salvaged holy words from the past to protect against future terrors. The messages are sometimes clear to those who can read them, but in other cases are obscure and dark, with only the prophet’s name and deeds vouching for their value. Contradicting the teachings of old matriarchs and patriarchs or doubting the visions of faction martyrs is political suicide within the Order. One of the darker prophecies, spoken by a holy tongue during the great final slaughter during the Portal Wars, is now demanding fulfilment, gruesome actions to be carried out for the greater good. As the holy words are about to be put into action, some within the Order reach the limits of their convictions and refuse to push on, while others are willing to become true martyrs for the cause – something which will happen very soon on the Coriolis station.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DARK OMENS</h5><p>One of the Order’s holy warriors, Iria Urahuk, formulated a holy statute while on the brink of death, staring into the void beyond. It spoke of signs by which the devout will know that the darkness is growing, signs that are now appearing all across the Horizon, demanding actions without hesitation.</p><h4>THE CONSPIRACY</h4><p>The conspiracy threatening the lives of the mystics onboard the Coriolis station is cruelly simple in all its complexity. It can be summarized as follows: Priot Chabaun and Deacon Salamah are high-ranking members of the martyr strike team known as The Warriors of the Holy Light, a fanatical splinter group from the Order. The strike team has set up a secret base on Kua and infiltrated Coriolis to kidnap and murder the station’s new mystics. The reason for this is that the strike team believes the mystics to be heralds of a coming menace, the dark between the stars threatening to invade the Third Horizon.</p><p>A slightly more detailed breakdown of the conspiracy looks like this:</p><ul><li>The Zenithian Hegemony, headed by Abarren Quassar, are looking to expand their influence in the Horizon, and particularly in the Council of Factions. The Hegemony is torn and plagued by in-fighting over how to do this.</li><li>The neo-Zenithians favor negotiation and cooperation with the other factions over aggressive expansion. The neo-Zenithians are ruled by the Ariantites clan and control the faction’s mighty fleet.</li><li>Their opponents are the hegemonists, under the leadership of captain Abarren Quassar himself. Together with his loyal spy chief Lenove Astir, captain Quassar has tasked the secret Astûrban police force with staging a spectacular operation onboard Coriolis to unify his faction and claim the title of ruler of the Third Horizon.</li><li>Through intermediaries and undercover agents, the Astûrban have funded and encouraged an extremist cult known as The Warriors of the Holy Light and their plans to go after the Coriolis station’s growing mystic population.</li><li>The endgame for the Astûrban is to blame the Order of the Pariah for the attacks and make sure they are portrayed as aggressive and dangerous. When tensions eventually erupt and war breaks out, the Hegemony plan on winning a decisive victory and establishing themselves as the new guardians of peace and stability in the cluster.</li></ul><h4>THE RETURN OF NAZAREEM’S SACRIFICE</h4><p>The White Butterfly and her crew of First Horizon infiltrators have been hard at work since their arrival. They have reached out to ancient sleeper cells from Nazareem’s Sacrifice with long-awaited new orders. The White Butterfly is currently making its way to the heart of the Third Horizon: Kua. The secret cults of Nazareem’s Sacrifice, sworn to the darker aspects of the Dancer Icon, have managed to place their spies within the highest levels of the government of the Zenithian Hegemony and its fearsome secret police, the Astûrban. The First Horizon agents, the vestals, have realized that the Hegemony is the perfect cover to use when preparing the Third Horizon for the dawn of a new age. They have even managed to convert the Priot of The Warriors of the Holy Light, and Astûrban’s false prophet, the agent placed in the martyr cell out in the Sultra marshes. The elimination of the Emissaries in the Third Horizon, and through that destabilizing the Second Horizon’s grasp, is one of the crew of The White Butterfly’s prime objectives.</p><h1>Overview</h1><hr /><p>The scenarios that make up the <em>Mercy of the Icons: Emissary Lost</em> story are briefly described below.</p><h4>THE WAKE OF THE MARTYR – Page 9</h4><p>@JournalEntry[Introduction]<br />The first scenario throws the PCs into a wild hunt for the missing mystics and their captors after one of their close friends or relatives goes missing. During the scenario, the Emissary on Coriolis disappears, and the group is contacted by a judge and a judicator who urge the PCs to also look for the missing Emissary. At the end of the scenario, the clues point to the steaming jungles of Kua.</p><h4>THE KUAN CONNECTION – Page 95</h4><p>@JournalEntry[Introduction - Kuan Connection]<br />The search for the missing Emissary continues through the jungles to the base of the Monolith. In the sinking city of Sultra, the PCs finally catch up with the last cell of the Warriors of the Holy Light, and find the Emissary on its deathbed. They see The White Butterfly take off and disappear into the night and the Emissary begs them to protect its brothers and sisters – avatars for the Icons themselves, risen from the depths of Xene, now spread among the systems of the Third Horizon.</p><h4>AFTERMATH – Page 188</h4><p>@JournalEntry[00 - Introduction - Epilogue]<br />As the dust settles, the PCs and their employers know that both the Astûrban and the Order of the Pariah have been compromised. They also know that a number of Emissaries are spread across the Horizon. The Aftermath section briefly describes some tips for adventuring before starting part two of the Mercy of the Icons campaign. Coming scenarios published for Coriolis will contain suggestions on how to connect them with the overarching storyline.</p><h1>GM Tips</h1><hr /><p>The <em>Mercy of the Icons</em> campaign is structured as a classic RPG epic, but you and your group are encouraged to tailor the scenarios to fit your playing style. The scenarios are pretty straightforward, but you are free to alter the timelines and the order of the scenes as you please. The Important Facts and Ending sections contain suggestions of what the PCs should have figured out before moving forward. Your job as the GM is to make sure that both looking for and finding the necessary clues are dramatic and rewarding tasks.</p><h4>SCENES</h4><p>Coriolis is played in scenes. This way of structuring the story enables you to skip long stretches of time or travel when nothing of importance happens. The scenes in the scenarios come in two forms – starting scenes and regular scenes – but they are all described in the same way. This should give you, as the GM, a good enough understanding of the important aspects of the scenes to enable you to modify them depending on how your group tackles the scenario. With the exception of the starting scenes, the order of the scenes as they appear below is not fixed and you are free to play them in any order.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SCENARIO LOCATIONS</h4><p>Emissary Lost will take the PCs to many new locations on Coriolis and Kua that haven’t been described in detail in earlier Coriolis supplements. The scenario locations are described with more detail than is perhaps necessary for the Mercy of the Icons campaign – with maps, lengthy descriptions, conflicts and narrative hooks, backgrounds and NPCs – but such information might come in handy if your group wishes to return for more adventuring later on:<br />Help the skavara society at the bottom of Coriolis' Cellar – dive in the Baybasin treasure caves – liberate the coal slaves on Verkâna Ridge – barter in the Conglomerate slums – search for lost artifacts in the ruins of the Sultra marshes – and last but not least, seek out the remaining Emissaries in the far reaches of the Third Horizon.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NPCS</h5><p>Each scene description contains an overview of the situation, the important events it contains, where it is located, what the important clues are, and a list of which NPCs the group will encounter. Several NPCs have talents or abilities that will cost Darkness Points to activate, but only if they are used against the PCs – if the talents or abilities are used only for the benefit of that particular NPC or if they are used to aid the PCs, you could instead limit their use to one free activation per scene.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BOOKMARKS</h5><p>The book contains bookmarks which you can use to mark where your players are in the story as well as provide easy access to clues under Important Facts entries or to the NPC lists.</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>Each scene contains a number of events that might happen during it. These events are fuelled by DP, usually costing you 0 DP for small or mandatory events, but more for events that pose new challenges for the PCs. The clues contained in a scene are usually not linked to any particular skill check, as a failed roll shouldn’t slow down the story, only force the players to choose a different path. Make sure that the clues are available for the PCs to find and remind them of things that a player might forget but that her PC would not.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  MYSTIC ECHOES</h5><p>You can let the disappearance of the Emissary affect mystic PCs in your group. The mystic will experience fragments of what has happened to the Emissary in the form of mystic resonance, echoes left behind by the Emissary’s powers. Resonance events can be found throughout the campaign but are of course optional.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/01-introduction/12_Martyrkommandot.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"rMy59nVBe3nvCUM4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296060,"modifiedTime":1682695296060,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"xjDNRHSTMrVt0hr2","sort":0,"_id":"NiAPOiiDo63P5ut1"}

The gravity of their situation becomes apparent, and they realize that the mission has failed – all that remains is to try and make it off the Ghazali alive.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>Next to the bulkhead doors separating the different sections of the ship are terminals for interfacing with the ship’s computer, but most are now broken. Senior crew members would have carried tablets for direct contact with Suleiman, but these haven’t survived either. The PCs will have to search for a terminal that still works, and it is up to you as the GM to decide when they find one. Have them sneak around the ship for a while, and sweat a little before they do. The terminal itself is a smooth surface on the wall onto which a PC puts her hand and states her name. The computer comes alive and greets them. Its name is Suleiman and it speaks in a low, thoughtful, male voice. Getting classified information – for example the location of the gun lockers – out of Suleiman isn’t easy, but he is more than willing to assist with evacuating the ship.</p><p>Many of the PCs’ questions will likely remain unanswered, either because Suleiman is too damaged to know the answer (“Unknown”) or because the PCs lack the necessary security clearance (“I am not authorized to share this information”). A powerful EM pulse from the portal detonation has destroyed much of Suleiman’s data banks, and he is not quite himself. Skilled computer operators will know how to work around some of the damage, and might get more out of him. How much information they get from the conversation depends on how well they do on a data djinn test. If they return to speak more with Suleiman later, they don’t have to roll again, but if they are dissatisfied with their level of success, acquiring the captain’s or first officer’s code keys can get them higher security clearance.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>SULEIMAN LIVES</h5><p>If you play the eccentric Suleiman as a living character, the meeting with him will be more dramatic. You could for example equip the terminal with modulation capabilities and have an avatar slowly materialize before the PCs. Suleiman looks like a wise old man, with a ceremonial headdress and shining eyes. The modulation is patchy, with ghostly holes here and there where data is missing. He speaks in a low voice, and looks straight ahead without making eye contact with the PCs. The avatar resembles a spirit from another dimension, which perhaps is what he is.</p></div><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>Have the PCs test data djinn to obtain information from Suleiman.</p><p><strong>Regardless of how they fare, he gives them the following information:</strong></p><ul><li>A map of the Ghazali. See the back of the book.</li><li>The Ghazali’s propulsion systems are offline, and there are no life signs on the bridge. The ship is currently in the Hamura system, one jump from Taoan. The ship is drifting toward the Hamura star, and will reach the D zone (the disintegration zone) in eighteen hours. Large sections of the ship are already destroyed or badly damaged.</li><li>The Ghazali is unmaneuverable, but escape pods can be found in several locations throughout the ship. Some of the ships docked on the port side still appear functional.</li><li>The ship was flooded with radiation when the portal exploded, and much of the sensor and control systems were destroyed. Suleiman has rebooted the remaining systems and is compiling a damage report. This explains why no evacuation order has been given – the jump crew was killed instantaneously, and the automated failsafes were burned out. Large parts of the crew on ice are badly irradiated or deceased.</li><li>The nearest safe port is the Hamurabi portal station, in orbit around Hamura, between the portals. The distance from the Ghazali to the station is currently about 1 AD. Sparsely populated systems like Hamura often have only one portal station, instead of the normal two. A slow ship makes the 1 AD journey in about twenty-four hours, while a fast one could make it there considerably faster.</li><li>The ship’s medlab was spared from damage. Suleiman can light a yellow strip in the floor to guide the way.</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">Limited Success</div><ul><li>The escape pods aren’t powerful enough to achieve escape velocity this close to the Hamura star and make it to the Hamurabi station, but ships strong enough to escape the gravitational pull that survived the blast are docked on the port side (one or two, the GM decides). Suleiman can light red strips in the floor guiding the way to the escape pods and the docked ships.</li><li>Information about what actually happened to the liner can be found on the bridge computer’s emerald disk. Suleiman has no contact with any of the systems on the bridge.</li><li>The jump crew was on the bridge at the time of the detonation. It is highly unlikely that any of them are still alive.</li><li>Internal sensors detect forty-seven additional lifeforms onboard, although there might be more, as the data is contradictory and unreliable. About two hundred rescue workers were onboard when the ship left Coriolis.</li><li>The chapel has been cut off from the rest of the ship. The sensors there are badly damaged but indicate that a group of survivors may have gathered there.</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">Critical success</div><ul><li>There are about thirty nekatra on the ship, in stasis in groups of between four and six individuals. They belong to the Legion, and are trained for reconnaissance and light skirmishes. They are controlled by their handlers via their collars, but the remote controls are all located on the Zafirah.</li><li>Classified information can be accessed by the captain or the first officer from the bridge. The crew and passengers’ weapons are kept on the bridge. Only the captain and the first officer have the code keys that open the arms locker. This is where the PCs will find their own weapons.</li></ul><h4>THE TERMINAL</h4><p>A screen on the wall with a keyboard, a microphone, and a camera. It comes alive when the PCs approach it. A red light stares at the group from the camera lens. They can use the terminal to contact Suleiman.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act1/stas.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"3n11HQ8X7XZA9ycm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252659,"modifiedTime":1680376252659,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"1fwOiyHqfa7kK99F","sort":0,"_id":"NvxzTQtvUS2xP2p7"}

Their influence is still very present for the Horizon’s inhabitants. No one really knows who the Portal Builders were. A myriad of theories exists, but the only sure thing is that they left the Horizon a long time ago. Perhaps they died out, were displaced by some great war, or reached what some of the more esoteric scientists call transcendence.</h3><p><strong>Regardless of the</strong> nature and reason for their absence, their presence still lingers. Portal Builder remains can be found across the Horizon – some small, others enormous and beyond the capabilities of human construction. That the Predecessors were far more technologically advanced than humanity is without question. Whether their technology and artifacts should be used by humans is a whole other matter.</p><p>The remains of the Portal Builder civilization leave no clues as to their physical appearance. Archaeologists have unearthed statues with engraved pictures on Qayna, Kua, Menkar and many other worlds, depicting creatures of non-human origin. A wildly debated topic is whether the pictures show intelligent beings or some semi-intelligence like nekatra or skavara. If the pictures were carved by the Portal Builders or someone else is also a topic of discussion. Regardless of which, the stones seem to have been carved a long time before the Firstcome colonized the Third Horizon</p><h4>DOORS TO OTHER WORLDS</h4><p>The most obvious remnants of the Predecessors are the portals. Without them, mankind would never have reached the stars so quickly or spread so far. Portal is the word used in everyday language, although portal field would be a more accurate term, as they are fluctuating and not confined by any physical constructs. The Foundation calls them Mathab Constructs after Aroz Mathab, the scientist who created the mathematical model used to calculate the portal fields’ reach and form before executing a jump.</p><p>The technology used to create portals is something that neither the Horizon’s engineers nor its theologists have been able to explain. There are reasonably well-substantiated theories describing the mechanisms of the jump, but no understanding whatsoever about how one would go about creating a portal. Many humans have tried to solve this mystery, but none have succeeded. Several smaller space stations are said to have imploded after their inhabitants attempted to create new portal fields.</p><p>The extent of the Portal Builder civilization is unknown. The systems linked by the portals to form the Third Horizon contain enough habitable worlds to support a large civilization, but there are many dreamers who speak of even more systems out there, untouched by humans, but reachable through the portals.</p><h4>THE HORIZON’S INHABITANTS AND THE PREDECESSORS</h4><p>There are many who have devoted their lives and careers to finding out who the Predecessors were. The Foundation looks at it from a scientific point of view, and tries to understand their history and technology. Many free trader captains look at it from a crass economical perspective, as non-human artifacts can be worth a whole lot of birr, and understanding the Portal Builders would mean understanding where these artifacts can be found. Some prefer to keep their opinions about the Predecessors to themselves. It is not known how intelligent non-human life would fit in with the Order of the Pariah’s fanatical worldview, and what the Draconites think about it is as usual the subject of wild speculation and whispered rumors. There are a few groups in the Horizon with more extreme opinions on the Predecessors.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> VEIL OF FAYSAL</h5><p>Within the Order of the Pariah, there is a small, tight-knit cult called Veil of Faysal, regarded as extremists by even the most bloodthirsty of martyr warriors. The Veil believes that all use of Portal Builder artifacts is heresy of the worst kind. They claim that continued use of the portals will lead to the Martyr abandoning the faithful. If the Veil had its way, the portals would be destroyed, and they are said to devote all their resources towards finding a way to achieve this goal. There are members of the Martyr Council who carefully support the Veil, but they have so far been unable to swing any votes in the cult’s favor. The more moderate factions of the Order keep an eye on the Veil, because although they have closed their system, the Order does not wish to see the portals closed for good.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE KEY BEARERS</h5><p>There is a secret society on Kua called the Key Bearers, said to hold the Portal Builders above even the Icons. The society is well known, but most people view them as harmless eccentrics. Others say that the Key Bearers have several members of mighty Zenithian families among their ranks, which would mean that the society has considerable political power.</p><p>The Key Bearers’ true belief is that the Portal Builders never left the Horizon, and that they are hiding in the indefinable space that exists between the portals. From there, the Predecessors see everything humanity does and measures the worth of mankind’s actions. One day, they will emerge from the portals again, bringing either apotheosis or apocalypse. The Key Bearers are convinced that the true believers will ascend to another plane of existence and that those who refuse to accept the truth will burn in a great reckoning.</p><p>So far, these doctrines are unknown to all but the Key Bearers themselves. If they were to be exposed, the society would likely face attacks on all fronts. The Hegemony would never allow such divergence in their ranks, the Church of the Icons would call them heretics, and if the Order were to take an interest in the Key Bearers, it would only be a matter of time before the society’s members faced horrible misfortunes.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/portalbyggarnas rester_dabaran.webp\" /></div><h4>WONDERS IN THE THIRD HORIZON</h4><p>The Portal Builders left strange monuments in their wake, scattered across the systems. Travelers will find buildings and strange astronomical and planetary phenomena that can only be described as wonders.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MONOLITHS</h5><p>The Monolith of Kua is considered by many to be of Predecessor design, but whether it is a fragment of an ancient city, some form of monument, or something completely different is unknown. The awe-inspiring height of the Monolith means that it looms over the districts of the Conglomerate below, with its shadow like an enormous sundial. A wandering zone of dusk covers one district after the other as the hours pass during the day. Gazing down from the spires and balconies of the Sky City, it looks like the arm of a gigantic clock turning on its axis from sunrise to sunset. The shadow of the huge obelisk has spawned countless myths that circulate on Kua.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE MENKAR MONOLITH</h5><p>There is no doubting the fact that the Zenithian Hegemony rules over the monolith on Kua, but humanity’s claim to the monolith in the Menkar Arm is a whole other matter. Just like the citadel of the Hegemony, the Menkar monolith is huge – almost four thousand meters from base to top – but in a much poorer state than its Kuan counterpart and leaning heavily. Despite these differences, the two were obviously constructed by the same architects.</p><p>The Menkar monolith is populated by humans, just like its sister on Kua. It towers above a hostile wilderness where many dangers lurk, a fact that made it a logical choice of refuge for the planet’s early settlers. Today, many of the buildings on the monolith are in ruins and the rest are sparsely inhabited. The reason for this is that the monolith suddenly moved and tilted over to assume the position it holds today. Thousands were killed as their once stable homes plummeted towards the jungles below. Nowadays, some regard the leaning monolith as a reminder of the folly of man and use it as an example of why one should stay away from the ruins of the Portal Builders altogether.<br />How and why the monolith shifted is not known. Out of fear that it will fall over completely, the residents have kept from digging down to examine its base. Astronomers and conspiracy theorists of questionable reputation claim that the monolith fell at the exact same moment the Zenith entered the Third Horizon. They say that it changed position to point towards the top of the Kuan monolith when the orbits of their respective planets allow it, but this has so far been difficult to prove.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/monolit.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE HOST OF KAMILIYYAH</h5><p>That the Monolith played an important religious role for the Firstcome tribes of Kua is well known, but its shadow is also of great importance to a modern splinter group from the Church of the Icons called the Host of Kamiliyyah. They are an ascetic cult of flagellants, constantly moving through the Conglomerate dusk zone below the Monolith. They preach that physical pain is the state closest to the Icons, and view time as the ultimate mystery. Kamiliyyah claims to be in possession of a secret code giving the cult unprecedented insights into the past, present, and future of the Horizon.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE EYE OF EKHARAN</h5><p>The Amedo system is home to the celestial body known as the Eye of Ekharan, orbiting the Amedo-B star. The Eye is a perfect ellipse, with a transverse axis of exactly 1,100 km. Since the observations of the Eye began, its orbit has stayed constant. That the Eye is not a natural phenomenon is obvious.</p><p>Because of its close proximity to Amedo-B, the Eye has so far proved unreachable to the foolhardy expeditions that have tried to examine it. Both the radiation and the extreme gravity of the star mean that spacecraft far beyond the limits of human engineering are required to reach the Eye. Not much is known about the Eye other than that at irregular intervals, it turns 90 degrees. No pattern to this behavior over time has so far been found. All attempts at sensor measuring have been disrupted by background radiation.</p><p>Most agree that the Eye of Ekharan must be a Portal Builder construct, as no traces have been found of any other civilization that would have been capable of making such an artifact.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE AWADHI SUN FAN</h5><p>A strange construct is orbiting the planet Denebula in the Awadhi system. The boiling planet, whose atmosphere consists of the noble gas hargium, is shadowed at regular intervals by a round construct reminiscent of a hand fan with blades that change colors from obsidian black to blinding silver. There is believed to be some form of intelligence controlling the phenomenon.</p><p>When the sun fan shadows the planet, the valuable hargium in the atmosphere is crystalized into fractalized hailstones. Death-defying prospectors seize the opportunity to fly into the hailstorms to gather the concentrated hargium, which can be sold to the factions or to one of the Horizon’s many shipyards. Hargium increases the thrust of graviton projectors.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE NODES</h5><p>In several places throughout the Third Horizon, there are so-called nodes that can facilitate mystical communication between different systems – and even between different Horizons. The nodes are often hidden deep inside gas giants, gas clouds, or asteroid swarms. In some cases, they are hidden in plain sight – clearly visible to the people of the Horizon, but entirely incomprehensible.</p><p>One such node is the web that hangs like a veil around the planet Izir in the Erequ. The web is made up of beams several AU long, consisting of a black, exotic matter that the prophets claim to be pure darkness. The Foundation has examined the web and pointed out that it is completely inert, believing that the beams are some form of extra-dimensional constructs. The beams form a hexagonal pattern that looks a lot like the mosaic that can be found in many of the Horizon’s temple windows.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"yQD2z5O4QtUIev6u","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264856,"modifiedTime":1680376264856,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"OFHdxH25K1xB9mEk"}

If the ambush in the Garden of Seekers left some of them wounded, help can be found with judge Kurahan and judicator Akouba. They are both impatient to get the PCs back on their feet and can arrange a doctor (Wits 5, medicurgy 3) right away, or a couple of M-doses.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs are heading through the basement of the Sanatorium to find the entrance to the upper Cellar. The map given to them by Brother Ramas will take them into the Cellar right next to The Third Sphere where Slummer Queen Elmeda holds court. As the GM, it is important to create the right atmosphere for the descent into the Cellar and the climb down should be dangerous (see Events below). Let the PCs use their skills to make it down, but bear in mind that this path is used regularly by the martyr strike team so you shouldn’t make it too difficult. The climb will take the group two to three hundred meters down toward the bottom of the station. Alternative ways to enter the Cellar are described on page 268 in the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[The Cellar].</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SAMARITAN’S WAY</h5><p>The route through the Sanatorium requires some persuasion and stealth – first, they must find (or make up) a reason for entering the Sanatorium, which likely will require a successful manipulation test. Once inside, they must test infiltration to sneak down the stairs without being noticed while following Brother Ramas' map. observation could also come in handy when looking out for patrolling Samaritans in the basement levels in the Sanatorium.</p><p>If the PCs are spotted trying to sneak through the Sanatorium, they will not be stopped – the Samaritans are pacifists, but those loyal to the cause of the martyr strike team will radio ahead to the Cellar, which might lead to an ambush along the way, in the Labyrinth, or near the secret base.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h1>The Cellar</h1><p>It is absolutely pitch black around you, and the only sounds come from the ventilation and from condensation dripping off ancient cooling systems. In front of you, something moves in the darkness, slithering softly across the floor – a native resident of the Cellar, far from lights and civilization.<br />The Cellar is the dark undercarriage of Coriolis, a twisted, shadowed, reflection of the world above: dark, damp, and haunted by creatures whose existence is denied by the station’s official representatives. The decay and hostility increases the further down one goes. Despite the spatial proximity to safety, ships, and other things that make life bearable, the Cellar might as well be light years away and travelers here are left to fend for themselves. Corridors full of leaking pipes lead to giant, empty halls with creaking fans and wailing vents where rusted service platforms and staircases moan unnervingly, suspended above bottomless, black pits.</p><h3><strong>THE UPPER CELLAR</strong></h3><p>The higher levels are pretty much abandoned. They are worn down but essentially in working condition. They are used every now and then for docking and storage when the Net is busy with some bulk hauler. The Guard patrols the upper Cellar, but not very often. A more accurate description of the Guard patrols here would be purge patrols, hunting the area’s few residents who almost certainly are hiding or smuggling something – or someone.</p><h3><strong>THE LOWER CELLAR</strong></h3><p>The lower levels show a rapidly increasing degree of decay. In the weak gravity at the bottom, mad, opor-sick slummers and semi-intelligences rule. Carrion eating skavara are quite common. Bundles of fiber optic cables and copper wire hang from the ceiling as most of the covers have been taken down to be sold or used as building material for huts. The air is thick with the smell of urine, opor, and fire. Sparks rain down over careless visitors followed by short periods of darkness as the fuses recover. The graviton projectors run on lower effect at the bottom of the Cellar due to sloppy maintenance and local slummers having stolen vital components. Down here (below The Third Sphere, see page 71 @JournalEntry[02 - In the Court of the Slummer Queen]), the PCs receive a –1 to DEXTERITY, MELEE COMBAT, and FORCE.</p></div>@JournalEntry[Brother Rama's Map]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/ramas_map_handout.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE JUDICATOR’S WAY</h5><p>If the PCs hesitate to try their luck finding their way through the Sanatotium, judge Kurahan will remind them of the dire importance of the mission. She will offer them judicator Akouba as a guide if they ask for help, which will enable them to take the Guard’s way down (see page 268 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[The Cellar]). In the headquarters of the Coriolis Guard, there are two elevators going down. Akouba can arrange for the PCs to use them, but will only come along for the ride down and not set foot in the actual Cellar.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs need to know that there is a way down to the Cellar, but you could slip them a warning about the area being dangerous and difficult to navigate. If they lack direction, have judge Kurahan suggest Akouba as a guide, but not in an official capacity. The route will then be via the Guard’s way (see the Coriolis core rulebook, page 268 @JournalEntry[The Cellar]). In the Coriolis guard’s headquarters at the Core, two elevator platforms will take the PCs down into the Cellar, but Akouba will not accompany the PCs beyond the entrance to the Cellar’s dwindling maintenance levels.</p><h4>THE BASEMENT OF THE SANATORIUM</h4><p>The steps leading you down into the darkness remind you of old, planetside crypts. Here and there, enormous beams and riveted ceramic plates show you that you are walking inside the skeleton of the station. Endless drops and empty darkness can be seen around you when you pass from one level to the next. You descend into the shadows of Coriolis for what seems like an eternity.</p><p>The Sanatorium has five basement levels below the courtyard, with claustrophobic tunnels and storage areas wedged in between the floors. The basements are in varying conditions, from worn-down corridors with flickering light strips to more well-kept, tiled areas containing operating rooms and supplies, but most parts of the underground facility are not in use any more. The lower floors contain mostly old patient rooms and cells, empty but with a lingering atmosphere of fear and pain. The stairs and ladders leading down to the Cellar can be found on basement level 5. The door to the staircase is locked but can be opened with a security tablet and a successful technology test. From there, the stairs will take the PCs straight down to the Cellar.</p><h4>THE GUARD’S ELEVATORS</h4><p>In the headquarters of the Coriolis Guard, located at the Core Plaza, two elevators connect the Cellar with civilization. This is the way down used by service personnel and Guard patrols. The Judicators' offices are in the same complex, and their status in the building makes the guards posted at the elevators step aside immediately as judicator Akouba approaches with the PCs in tow. The elevator cars are slow and only relatively safe – the railing has come loose and the controls are rusted. The two shafts run through the spine of the station together with the central lines of power and water. The two guards insist on accompanying the car down but stay silent, glaring angrily at Akouba standing in the front with her back turned on the other passengers.</p><p>The platform groans tiredly and starts its slow descent into the darkness. The two guards keep a respectful distance from the judicator while glancing nervously at each other. The noise of the plaza above is quickly replaced by a low rumbling. Dark pipes in the walls transport purified water upwards. Endless rows of rivets pass you by and you can feel the weight of your gear and weapons slowly lessen as the artificial gravity starts to wane.</p><p>When arriving at the bottom, the judicator explains the way to the next level via a nearby spiral staircase, but refuses to come along herself. She has much work to do in the chaos above left behind by the disappearance of the Emissary.</p><h4>THE UPPER CELLAR</h4><p>When the PCs have continued a little bit further through the darkness, they reach an area where all shafts, staircases, and ladders are welded shut or blocked by collapsed debris. Next to the welding is usually a sign with the Coriolis Guard’s stylized diamond mark, indicating that further travel is prohibited. No routes from here seem to lead either down or outwards toward the hull. By now, you should let the PCs find The Third Sphere (see the At the Court of the Slummer Queen event below).</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>Use the preacher stats (page 343 of the Coriolis core Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Your Job as the GM]) when dealing with the Samaritans in the scene.</p>@Actor[Purge Patrol]<h4>EVENTS</h4><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/vandring_genom.webp\" /></div><p>Only use one event in this scene, as it should mainly be used to set the mood for the final act and not slow down the tempo of the story.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE CENTRAL SHAFT</h5><p>The blocked-off corridors eventually merge with the central shaft. Rather than being a straight shaft, it looks more like a complicated cave network of conjoined duralite halls and enormous rooms stacked on top of each other in a chaotic fashion. A myriad of overhangs and balconies connected by a spider’s web of beams and cables keeps the colossal construction in place. The shaft has three huge junctions called the ”necks”. At the junctions, the halls converge to form an octagonal passage fitted with twelve large ventilation turbines. The first neck is just below the Core, at the top of the Cellar. The second neck is located near The Third Sphere. The third neck can be found deep down, pushing up air from the filter units, the lack of gravity notwithstanding. Using the central shaft to get down is a strange and dangerous journey – the PCs will climb stairs along the walls that shake and creak from the vibrations caused by the enormous turbines. Some halls are somewhat sheltered from the vibrations and wind, and contain dripping condensation and swarms of odd-looking fireflies. From seeing the decrepit state of the station’s life support systems, one would be hard pressed not to view the fact that the station is functioning at all as miracle. At the cost of 1 DP, you could collapse or block a staircase, forcing the PCs to climb or jump to continue. Don’t forget the negative modifiers caused by the low gravity.</p><p>Cost: 0–1 DP</p><h4> RESONANCE – SHIVERS</h4><p>The closed-off corridors and welded-up doors make the journey through the darkness appear as a winding maze, full of dead ends. When the group reaches the central shaft, mystic PCs might suddenly feel a strange uneasiness followed by a throbbing headache. They hear the crack of stun gun in their heads and smell ozone in the air. Only mystic PCs can feel it, however. If the PCs pass a demanding (–1) observation test, they can spot a Vulcan carbine pinned to a beam a few meters up in the middle of the shaft. If there are no mystics in the group, they will all just feel anxious and uneasy instead.</p><ul><li><strong>The Emissary Wakes Up</strong>: On the way down through the central shaft, the Emissary suddenly woke up (the warriors had underestimated its resistance to shock weapons). A powerful sonic blast threw one of the warriors over the railings to be mangled by the fans in the neck above. The sonic impulse is still partly active, changing the direction of the air coming from below. The martyr warrior dropped his carbine in the fall, which got stuck under a beam in the shaft, held in place by residual winds from the Emissary’s sonic impulse. The last warrior managed to subdue the Emissary once more, using a stun gun, before continuing down toward the secret base far below.</li></ul><p>Unless the PCs pray to the Icons, asking for their favors, the GM receives 4 DP (see Darkness Points at the beginning of Act 3).</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (GM gain 4 DP)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FREE FALLING ELEVATOR</h5><p>The climb down is tiring and slow. Every now and then, the PCs reach floors that don’t seem to allow further passage down. At one such floor, they come across an elevator room with three seemingly functional elevators. One of them can be activated using technology and looks to be in decent condition.</p><ul><li><strong>Falling Elevator</strong>: The mag locks on the elevator are unfortunately broken. The ride starts out fine, but the car starts to pick up speed as it moves through the Cellar. The emergency brakes are unresponsive. The PCs must pass a difficult (–2) technology test to short-circuit the emergency brakes and stop the car. If the PCs fail to stop the car, certain death will be avoided only by the decreasing gravity slowing the acceleration, but riding the car all the way down is certainly not a healthy pastime! Passengers in the elevator will receive fall damage equivalent to an 8-meter fall (see Coriolis core rulebook page 97 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). Gravity is low at the bottom of the elevator shaft, and exiting the crushed car requires passing a difficult (–2) dexterity or force test. After one PC has climbed out, the others can follow without rolling dice.</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PURGE PATROL</h5><p>A Guard patrol is on a purge of the Cellar. They open fire on anything that moves and shoot to kill. They have found a camp made by slummers and beggars and are just about to execute the prisoners when the PCs arrive. The group can choose to intervene or sneak past.<br />The patrol could also be sneaking around, which would require a successful observation test from the PCs to spot them and a successful <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> test to avoid them. If the PCs are spotted, a firefight is unavoidable if they cannot persuade the guards using <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong>, contacts or the Faction Standing talent.</p><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><div class=\"blueheader\">UPPER CELLAR AMBIANCE</div><ul><li>Echoes of gunfire come drifting through the corridor from far away.

Emphasis in the scene should be on the passage through the dreaded Labyrinth.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>Getting to the lower Cellar is difficult and dangerous. The PCs will either have a map, a description of the way, or a guide – Frax, Awl, or Goba the Lame. The first part is a climb down a series of long shafts, on rusted ladders along the walls. After that, they reach the Labyrinth. The scene will require the PCs to prove their worth – they will have to test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong>, <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong>, <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong>, and <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> so as to either avoid or confront the Beast at the end of the scene. Make sure to establish a dark, terrifying atmosphere as the PCs climb down into the bottomless unknown.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs have left The Third Sphere with information that will lead them to the secret base. As they cross the Labyrinth, they will find out that the Beast is real, and something they should attempt to avoid. If the group left the previous scene without any knowledge of the location for the strike teams’ secret base, or without knowing about the sensors around the base, you should use The Mad Poet event, and have Bathos tell them what they need to know.</p><h4>THE LABYRINTH</h4><p>The Labyrinth is an area encompassing several floors separating The Third Sphere from the lower Cellar. It is almost impossible to find the way through without a map or a guide. The floors in the Labyrinth range from large open spaces shot through with black pits to thick forests of beams and cables. A maze of stairs, elevator shafts, vents, and pipes surround the group on all sides. It is not always possible to keep climbing down – to find the right way, one must sometimes turn back and head up or sideways to find the right passage. The lighting is poor and groups of potentially dangerous slummers wander the area, either lost or living here. Rumors say that sarcofagoi have found their way here from the deepest darkness between the stars.</p>@JournalEntry[The Slummer Queen's Map]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SLUM CEMETERY</h5><p>The way down from The Third Sphere or the Skavara Market passes through a few floors close to the Labyrinth left alone by the residents of the Cellar – no trash is dumped here, nothing is scavenged, nothing is repaired. The dark, decrepit corridors start below the second vent neck, just a few stairs from the gates of the queen’s domains. Algae and cold moss cover the walls and the thick layers of organic waste are used by the more civilized of the Cellar dwellers to bury their dead in – and by the Syndicate when they need to hide a body. The stench of decay can sometimes be overwhelming or even dangerous when gases are confined in tight spaces. The graves are often marked by some simple signs, a name and perhaps a short poem or a date. Icon symbols made from debris mark the rooms that are in use and there are lanterns here and there, kept lit by the cemetery warden. No one stays here longer than necessary, out of fear of the souls of the dead – and even worse things.</p><ul><li><strong>Joubas (Warden)</strong>: Aging preacher Joubas tends to the graves, makes sure the Icons symbols are looked after, and keeps the lanterns lit to ward of dybuks and sarcofagoi. Supported by his long staff and armed with a lighter, a flashlight, and an enhanced humanite immune system and night vision, Joubas is perfectly suited for life in the darkness. He sometimes misses the company of the living – speaking with the souls of the dead is just not the same thing.</li><li><strong>Hima Iamas (Syndicate Cleaner)</strong>: Dragging bodies down to the Slum Cemetery – from the Sewers or from gangfights higher up – is very dirty buisness. Luckily for Hima, she is only required to bring people important enough for a “clean” burial down here – those whose spirits one wishes to put to rest. The biggest problem with her job is that most of her predecessors have ended up here themselves, and she fears the same fate – spending eternity in the company of those she has buried here.</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">Notes in Shafir the Wanderer's journal</div><p><em>The railing suddenly disappeared and we looked out across an entire floor filled with the detritus of the Cellar. As we went further in, the mush on the floor – an unnameable goo with pieces of plastic and wood visible here and there – became thicker and the stench of decay became worse. We passed tiny rooms where we could see small Icon statues on the floor, made from trash. There were short texts scribbled on the walls, eulogies to slummers buried here.</em></p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LAIR OF THE BEAST</h5><p>At the center of the Labyrinth, in the very heart of the Cellar, the corridors are empty. They range from regular height to massive chasms, narrow but many stories high. Pipes that used to carry power, gases and water run along the walls but everything is long since silent and dark here. Black holes in the walls lead to cramped crawlways and old service stations. Slummers who get lost down here tell stories of corridors that move around and change direction without you noticing. Some claim to have heard the fearsome howls of the Beast echo through the central shaft, or to have seen its shadow in the twisted corridors of the Labyrinth: “The savage sentinel – a black shadow that can move through walls, locking its victim in a fatal embrace and sucking out their souls.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>The residents of the Labyrinth consist of withered, old slummers, lunatics, and the Beast.</p><ul><li>@Actor[The Beast]</li><li>@Actor[Bathos Emoud]</li><li>@Actor[Slummers]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>These events could take place on the way to the Labyrinth, inside it, or when the PCs leave The Third Sphere.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/beast.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MAD POET</h5><p>Bathos is a demented ex-bureaucrat who has taken it upon himself to rid the Cellar of sinners, but he isn’t doing so well at it. Regardless of whether the PCs identify as children of the light or warriors of the darkness, he will strike up a conversation with them. He is stark raving mad, but may know a few important things about the Cellar. If the PCs help him repair the “light whip” – he is missing a cell – he will be eternally grateful (+2 to all further manipulation tests when dealing with Bathos). The PCs spot him at a distance wandering around singing. Use the following text as it is or as inspiration when describing the meeting with Bathos:<br />A weak voice echoes through the empty hallway: crackling singing, interrupted by dry coughs, describing life in the Cellar. Suddenly, the singer appears in front of you, a tiny little man wrapped up in sheets of plastic, waving a bundle of fiber optic cables around, as if he was conducting an invisible orchestra.</p><ul><li><strong>The Song</strong>: The song he is singing is his “threnody” (see the adjacent quote).</li><li><strong>Slummers</strong>: There are mad slummers who attack “travelers” in the Cellar. “The first ten or so times were the worst, but they eventually learned that it wasn’t worth it.”</li><li><strong>The Beast</strong>: There is a beast at the center of the maze. Avoid it at all costs. “Not even I am powerful enough to defeat it. I don’t have enough light to disperse the darkness feeding its hate.”</li><li><strong>The Emissary</strong>: He has spoken with the Emissary, who also happens to be a poet. “Well, the Messenger’s works were somewhat naïve, but they expressed artistic ambition. I remain hopeful.” The Emissary was being held captive, and was unable to answer any questions – eight guards with sugar globes in their hands covered his mouth. The only thing the Emissary managed to communicate was a half-decent attempt at poetry:</li></ul><p><em>“When the unworthy speak without tongues<br />When sister betrays sister<br />When the light of peace nourishes the servants of darkness<br />When brother kills brother”</em></p><ul><li><strong>The Dream</strong>: If he is pressed for details, he will reveal that he never actually met the Emissary, but that they shared a psychic experience, like a dream. “They were imprisoned in a dark place, but promised me everything was going to be fine. I felt calm and relieved by their words.”</li><li><strong>Mystics</strong>: Bathos has seen unconscious or drugged mystics being dragged through the Labyrinth, to the newcomers' temple, which is what he calls the strike team’s base. “Not just the Emissary has been claimed by the Cellar.”</li><li><strong>Sensors</strong>: The strike team’s base is surrounded by sensors. “The jailors' gaze reaches outside the prison.”</li></ul><p>If the PCs manage to sift through Bathos' ramblings, his eyes will clear for a second and he will say in a calm voice:<br />“You won’t be able to save the living Icon, but you must find them – so that they instead may save you.”</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><p><em>I open the first door</em><br /><em>A small and dark room</em><br /><em>A tiny slummer passes by outside</em><br /><em>Causing the drapes to move</em><br /><em>I open the second door</em><br /><em>Fiends!

Signs of human habitation are scattered all over the place – tattered clothes, boxes, blankets, and garbage. It is very quiet however, abandoned and forgotten. If the PCs pass an observation –1 test, they will hear a sudden scratching noise around a corner, a little too loud to be the ventilation. A horde of slummers suddenly emerges, a brown mass of worn scraps and broken bodies.</p><p>The hungry and opor sick slummers surround the PCs. They are desperate and calculate their chances to steal the PCs' gear and chew the supple flesh off their bones. How it all plays out is up to the PCs – they can either try to use manipulation or fight for their lives. If a fight breaks out, the slummers in the front will fight to the death, and those in the back will run away with equal conviction. It will be a short battle. If the PCs try to keep them away and run, they will follow, unless the chase takes them somewhere they are afraid to go, such as close to the Beast, deep shafts, the Skavara Market, or the martyr strike team’s base.</p><p>Cost: 3 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CELLAR’S WRATH</h5><p>This event can be used multiple times and includes accidents and dangers in the Cellar not relating to NPCs – it could be collapsing beams and floors or lights that go out.

The ruins of the palace are used by the martyr strike team as a collection point for supplies and prisoners, and it is here that they have set up their jamming equipment. The PCs find the stasis pods they are hunting – but none of the prisoners.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs have reached the pods’ final destination. The martyr warriors have thawed their prisoners here, drugged them, and brought them to their base in the nearby Foundation hospital. The empty pods are dumped in a chasm that opened when the basement was flooded and collapsed. Inside the palace, the PCs encounter two strike team scouts, Darius and Nepotha, but they are not alone; the immense suffering and despair witnessed by the palace has corrupted it, and haunted shrieks can be heard from the lower levels where darkbound remnants of former palace residents have taken refuge, trapped in a living nightmare. The darkbound keep to the shadows, and the martyr strike team has so far been able to keep operating on the upper floors.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs should somehow figure out that the abductees have been thawed at the palace and brought to the nearby hospital. Most of this information can be found in the room used by the martyr scouts as a reloading point for incoming deliveries (see the Terminus event).</p><h4>THE SUL MAHALA</h4><p>The Sul-Mahala palace is located next to the beautiful Mahala terrace gardens. Many hundreds of years ago, prince Mahala Em ab-Dalak used the palace as a summer residence and the gardens were home to fantastic birds said to sing in perfect harmony ever since the day the prince met his beloved Sharim. After an incident involving the prince’s brother Alakh, Mahala had Sharim executed and all the birds suddenly fled the gardens. Their final song contained a prophecy saying that all things the prince had built and cherished would one day be destroyed.</p><p>Today, the palace and the surrounding gardens have been reclaimed by nature. The Cataract failure swept much of the gardens away, and over the years since the flood, many of the brooks and rivers that come down from the plateau have carved out new paths through the area. Deep trenches cut through old roads and plazas, and hundreds of tiny waterfalls slowly transport the water down through the palace grounds toward the black waters of the marshlands below.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ENTRANCES</h5><p>What used to be the highest of the walled terraces has collapsed, forming a dark pond from which broken ruins protrude here and there. Broken glass and shattered mosaics glimmer just below the surface in the faint light that penetrates the mist. In the middle of the pond, the central tower of the palace looms, dark in the distance. The main entrances are deep underwater, but some of the higher balconies are accessible and connect to the interior of the palace. The area is still and eerily quiet. If one listens very closely, a strange hissing sound can be heard coming through the cracks in the walls.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CENTRAL TOWER</h5><p>The palace interior consists of wide, dark chasms and slippery, winding marble stairs. Vines and thorns suck tainted life from the dark waters and climb the broken pillars inside the palace toward the broken stained glass windows above. The air is thick with dust and soot. On the lower levels, one finds fragile coal statues that disintegrate on touch and thick layers of grimy ash (see the Ghosts of the Sultra NPCs below). The upper levels of the central tower are full of long halls and corridors, cracked balconies, silent fountains, and galleries filled with broken marble statues, columns, and empty pools. The mosaics tiles break beneath the feet of the PCs, apart from in the rooms where old draperies and paintings have fallen to the floor and degraded into a fine layer of soil. It is one of these rooms – on the upper levels, in order to get away from the smell of the bog and the cries from the basement – that the martyr strike team has set up its outpost.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE OUTPOST</h5><p>The room chosen by the martyr warriors has high ceilings resting on pillars. Two large trees grow in the middle, supporting the cracked outer wall that looks like it is about to collapse. Workbenches and a tent have been set up along the inner wall by the only entrance to the room, an open doorway leading to a wide staircase. Shattered glass and clay mosaics have been collected and arranged in the shape of a martyr’s crown on a clean stone table. Candles and sticks of incense surround the altar. In the back of the room, a broken balcony overlooks one of the deep chasms. The martyr scouts have pushed the empty stasis pods over the edge and let them fall into the darkness. The thawed prisoners have been drugged at a makeshift medstation – a couple of cots and a table with some basic medical equipment. More information can be found in the Terminus event below.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>The palace first appears empty, but inside, the PCs run the risk of encountering the darkbound or walking into an ambush set by the martyr scouts. Judicator Akouba Kosha will follow the PCs to the end, always making sure to point out that the evidence uncovered seems to point toward the Order being behind the operation.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Darius]</li><li>@Actor[Nepotha]</li><li>@Actor[The Ghosts of the Sultra]</li></ul><h4>Events</h4><p>The PCs’ goal in the scene is to get inside the palace and find the martyr warriors’ outpost there. As the GM, you are free to make the scene longer (by adding combat with the darkbound or the martyr scouts for example) or keep it short to enable the PCs to find the clues they need straight away.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESONANCE – THE DEATH OF THE EMISSARY</h5><p>This is the final resonance event reserved for mystic PCs.</p><ul><li>When the PCs enter the palace, or the room used by the martyr strike team, the group’s mystic feels uneasy and faint. Her skin crawls and the world seems gray and distant.</li><li>At the cost of 1 DP, the affected PC must test mystic powers to remain in control of herself. Failure causes her to suffer a –2 to all actions where she must rely on sight or touch for D6 minutes. At the cost of 1 additional DP, the itching in her skin rapidly becomes worse until she feels like she is on fire, and the PC suffers 1 point of damage and 2 points of stress.</li><li>Through the gray mist, the mystic PC sees three ghostly silhouettes approaching, dressed in long, white gowns. A monotonous chanting grows steadily until it cuts like knives in her ears. Suddenly, the affected PC hears a faint song emanating from inside herself. The soft words force the ghosts to retreat and the PC slowly begins to understand the meaning of the song. The pain intensifies nonetheless, until it becomes unbearable and the shielding song turns into a cry of pain. The PC feels as if she is being flayed alive and collapses on the ground. She is unconscious for a turn or two before the vision fades and she feel fine again.</li></ul><p>The PC experiences the final moments of the dying Emissary. At the martyr strike team’s base, the White Butterfly has arrived, bringing with it the agents of the First Horizon, the Vestals. They have convinced the martyr warriors that they are Serafs – angels sent by the Martyr to help the faithful defeat the Emissary’s dark powers. They use their immense knowledge of the dark between the stars to destroy the Emissary’s host body.<br />If you’d like, the event can be used as a clue to the location of the martyr strike team’s base. After the visions fades, the affected PCs can see the direction of the place where the event took place as a small bright dot on her retina when she closes her eyes.</p><p>Cost: 0–2 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><p>THE ICON’S GRACE<br />The fragments come together,<br />a thousand faces for the shadows.<br />My children, my beloved,<br />hear my song and become it.<br />In your darkest hour,<br />hear my song and defend it.<br />Sing brothers, sing sisters,<br />sing it.</p><p>– Nabi-mu-Qad, the Messenger Emissary</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE STASIS PODS</h5><p>In the black water at the bottom of the chasm sits a pile of discarded stasis pods. After thawing and drugging their prisoners, Darius and Nepotha have pushed the empty pods into the chasm. At least one of the pods cracked from the fall but several of the others look more or less intact.</p><ul><li>There are about twenty pods in all in the hole, all with black numbers painted on the lids. Several of them are still full of stasis fluid, but much has leaked into the water from the ruptured pods.</li><li>There are eight intact, salvageable containers of stasis fluid in the hole, but diving into the water without an exo results in 1 point of radiation.</li></ul><p>If you want to make it more of a challenge for the PCs to salvage the stasis fluid, the darkbound ghosts have covered the top pods with their black secretions and might be lurking nearby (see the Dark Sentries event below).</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ECHOES IN THE DARKNESS</h5><p>Soot particles hang in the air and a humid mist obscures the lower floors. A spiral staircase covered in slippery algae leads down into the darkness from the high balconies above. As the PCs step out on the balcony and look down, they hear a hissing sound from below and spot something moving.</p><p>If the PCs are loud, the creature will let out a terrifying scream and try to find the source of the noise. It avoids the light coming in through the broken windows but ascends the side of the stairs with incredible speed.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DARK SENTRIES</h5><p>The PCs reach an area or a part of the stairs where strange, knee-high ash formations block their way. They are porous and fragile and the air is heavy with soot and dark dust. Passing through the area without touching the black statues requires a successful infiltration test at –2. Alternatively, the group can climb past by testing dexterity, but critical successes are required to avoid detection by the nearby darkbound. If any of the rolls fail, see the Dark Hunters event below.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DARK HUNTERS</h5><p>At the cost of 1 DP, you could have the ghosts of the Sultra use their Living Sludge ability to sense the location of the PCs. This leads to one creature beginning to move toward the group. At the cost of 1 additional DP, a group of two to three ghosts attack, and for 2 additional DP, a total of four or five ghosts surround the PCs and attack from different directions. Their hunting screams echo through the corridors and their burning mouths and eyes can be seen through the darkness. They dislike sunlight but will attack regardless if there are more than one.</p><p>Cost: 1, 2–3 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RUINS</h5><p>The palace interior consists of decrepit stairs, corridors, and balconies slowly being torn apart by thick vines with crimson leaves. The trip through the palace might be difficult and dangerous:</p><ul><li><strong>Thorns (1 DP)</strong>: A section ahead is so full of thorns that getting through will be tough. Each PC must test dexterity or force, with a +1 from cutting melee weapons. Failure results in 2 points of damage and 1 point of stress.</li><li><strong>Collapsing Floors (1–2 DP)</strong>: The balcony the PCs are on suddenly shakes and tilts. At the cost of 1 DP, one PC is affected and at the cost of 2 DP, the whole group risks falling off. Affected PCs must pass a dexterity test or suffer damage from the fall (strength 6 attack, weapon damage 1, CRIT 3, armors may be tested). A critical success achieved by one PC can be used to negate the failure of a comrade.</li></ul><p>Cost: See above</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TERMINUS</h5><p>The martyr strike team’s outpost is located on one of the upper floors (see the description on page 163 @JournalEntry[02 - Heart of Darkness]). The scouts are reluctant to let anyone enter their base, and have dealt with earlier shipments on a balcony one floor down. Unless the PCs have dealt with Darius and Nepotha earlier, or convinced them to let the group enter the outpost, there is a great risk that they will attack as the PCs near the room (see the Ambush event below). Investigating the room reveals the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The Cracks</strong>: Two tall trees grow in the room. The crowns support the collapsing roof and the outer wall, through a crack in which one has a clear view of the surrounding area. Tarps suspended from the higher branches provide cover from rain for some assorted technical gear and a fusion unit next to one of the trees. Peering through the crack in the wall, a PC who passes an observation test can see lights at the nearby hospital.</li><li><strong>The Laser Communicator</strong>: Cables connected to the faintly humming fusion unit under the tree run to what looks like a telescope on a tripod. An easy (+1) technology test can tell the PCs that the gadget is an advanced laser communicator, pointing toward the abandoned nearby Foundation hospital, rumored to be the source of the valley’s cursed fate and the dam collapse. The com has been used by the scouts to communicate with their superiors and to report on new shipments. All communication via the unit is encrypted and the key is only known by the scouts. If the PCs have been noisy or slow getting through the palace, the scouts have sent a warning to their commanders, and the martyr strike team will subsequently be more alert in the next scene, A Great Winged Shadow. The communicator has been given to the strike team by the Astûrban, and a demanding (–1) technology test can reveal that it looks Zenithian, and that it’s probably not available on the open market.</li><li><strong>The Jamming Equipment</strong>: The fusion unit is also connected to a radio transmitter. A successful technology or data djinn test reveals that it appears to be an advanced and upgraded class IV communicator functioning as a jammer. A demanding (–1) technology test reveals it to be Zenithian, and a military model only used by tactical forces and elite units. Turning it off without it sending a warning to the martyr strike team is an easy (+2) technology test. Keeping it on but limiting its jamming spectrum requires a demanding (–1) data djinn test.</li><li><strong>The Workbenches</strong>: By the inner, less damaged wall, a simple tent and two workbenches have been set up. Boxes of ammunition and food are scattered around the benches, as well as two advanced tool kits, five blessed M-doses (+2 to medicurgy), and ten injectors. A science or medicurgy test reveal the contents of the injectors to be some form of psychotropic drug. A critical success reveals it to be a carefully tailored mix of opor and a synthetic component known as sinthropane. The drug induces a trancelike state where the affected person becomes very susceptible to suggestion. A small chemical laboratory on one of the workbenches has been used by the martyr scouts to modify one of the injectors with a higher dose of sinthropane (to use on the Emissary). Sinthropane is very hard to come by as it is almost exclusively produced as a military interrogation drug (see the The Interrogation Drug box below).</li><li><strong>The Altar</strong>: Pieces of broken glass and clay are laid out in an intricate pattern on a beautifully carved stone table, surrounded by candles and sticks of incense. The area in front of the altar is covered in tiny blood spatter and a leather whip nearby is dark with dried blood. As the mission grew to weigh heavier and heavier on Nepotha’s mind, she devoted herself to prayer and flagellation in the hopes of divine guidance.</li><li><strong>The Balcony</strong>: Opposite the entrance to the room, a balcony overlooks the deep drop below. The railing has been smashed and scratch marks on the floor lead off the edge. This is where the stasis pods have been pushed down into the darkness.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE INTERROGATION DRUG</h4><p>You can either choose to use the regular poison rules for a strength 6 poison or use these, more advanced, rules: The drug forces the affected person to roll an opposed Empathy vs poison strength 6 test. The special batch used to drug the Emissary is instead a strength 12 poison.<br />Failure results in 6 points of stress, which almost certainly results in the person becoming broken. The victim also suffers a –1 to Empathy until all of her HP and MP have been restored. If the victim is broken by the stress suffered, she also suffers an atypical critical injury (page 95 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) and dies after D6 days unless treated with MEDICURGY. Despite being broken, the person is not unconscious, but rather in a trance-like state. She can only move if explicitly told to.</p><p>Limited Success results in a –1 to Empathy for 4D6 hours, but no stress.<br />Critical Success results in a –1 to Empathy for D6 hours, but no stress.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AMBUSH</h5><p>The martyr scouts Darius and Nepotha try to avoid a direct confrontation with the PCs. They trust that the ghosts will deal with the intruders, but if the PCs close in on their outpost (see the Terminus event above), you might spend 2 DP to have the scouts prepare an ambush for the PCs from an elevated, fortified position.</p><ul><li><strong>Interrogation</strong>: If the scouts are captured, they might be convinced to reveal the position of Chabaun’s base in the nearby hospital. Resolve this with an opposed manipulation test. If both scouts are alive, they get a +2 to their roll. If the PCs win the test, the scouts also confess to waning belief in the Priot’s brutal methods, and that they don’t trust the new prophet in the group. They are adamant in their devotion to the wisdom of Iria Urahuk however, and believe that the Horizon must be cleansed of all dark omens, such as these so-called new mystics. If the PCs achieve a comparative critical success – winning the test by three sixes or more – the scouts can also inform them that the tech in the outpost, as well as most of the weapons used by the strike team, are gifts from “sympathizers within the Hegemony’s leadership”. If the PCs press the scouts on this issue, one of them eventually reveals a piece of shocking information: the Astûrban are in on the operation. If this is the first the PCs hear of this, it will probably change their view of the investigation, but it also puts them in the crosshairs of the hegemonist conspirators through their double agent, judicator Akouba Kosha.</li><li><strong>The Judicator’s Betrayal</strong>: If the interrogation of the scouts begins to turn up damning information on the Hegemony or the Astûrban, Akouba will – if present – try to dismiss and silence the scouts by saying that they are trying to con the PCs. Unless the PCs buy this, she realizes that the only way forward is to eliminate them and bring the evidence against the Order to the Council herself.</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WHITE BUTTERFLY</h5><p>During the PCs investiagtion of the Sul-Mahala, they witness something extraordinary. As the GM, you are free to play this event at any time – perhaps as the PCs realize where the laser communicator is pointing to, or as they leave the palace to head for the Foundation hospital. Read out the text below or use it as inspiration:</p><p>In the darkening sky, high above the still waters around you, the stars slowly become visible, one by one. Your breath suddenly hangs in clouds before you as the mist turns cold, much colder than what should be possible in the Kuan jungles. You feel your chests tightening as a wave of fear and anxiety washes over you, and as you turn to look up, you see it: a hazy apparition illuminating the ruins of the Sultra – a white butterfly in the darkness. Its great wings seem to bend light around them in an impossible way, and it ascends like no other ship you’ve seen before. For a moment, it seems to hang motionless above the trees, and then the wings come alive with brightly glowing, perfectly symmetrical glyphs – like blood vessels filled with liquid light. A halo of light forms around the ship as it sets off for the dark void – leaving Kua, but going where?</p><p>At the cost of 1 DP, the event severely affects the mental health of the PCs. Have them test mystic powers (or Empathy, if they lack the skill). Failure results in 3 points of stress. Success results in (3 minus number of sixes on the roll) points of stress.</p><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP</p><p>You and your group will encounter the Vestals and their ship, White Butterfly, again in coming scenarios in the Mercy campaign. This scene is merely designed to hint at the awesome powers they wield, and to assure the PCs that they are on the right track – the hospital is very close, and that is where their investigation finally ends.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/fjärilhimmel.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"fMGcIk8ZUeWXL6rk","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296590,"modifiedTime":1682695296590,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"YOMfroAUYC191oYi","sort":0,"_id":"Oh6J4BnPSwObHJLl"}

With the possible exception of the most ardent disbelievers in the Foundation, the Dark between the Stars makes everyone nervous. Stories of black magic, necromancy, and dark covenants involving blood-curdling rituals or mechanical cadaver clocks are common among the Firstcome people. Some scientific studies have even found signs of similar mythology among semi-intelligent species such as ekilbri and skavara. The universe is also thought to harbor many other things that the Foundation’s sensors and tomographs cannot explain. Black birr, hadra clouds, djinni, and maajib are all signs that the world is not at all simple or easy to comprehend.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE SMILING EFRITE</h5><p>There is one exception to the common myth of the evil efrite – the tale of how the smiling efrite met the storyteller Salimede. The efrite was so enchanted by her stories, and the fact that she gave him her little finger as a gift, that he promised to only help people from that day forward, as long as they told him a good story. The smiling efrite is said to show up around festivals or circus visits, but you just might find him in a quiet cantina as well, waiting for a story. In return, the efrite will make the storyteller’s travels easier.</p></div><h4>DJINN</h4><p>The djinn turn up in almost all Firstcome fairy tales and myths, although sometimes as yin, jinni, janna, or bokor. Djinn are thought to be unpredictable spirits, full of tricks. In folklore, the djinn are sent by the Icons to assist heroes or punish tyrants and liars. They often show up as mirages, whirlwinds, or just a shimmering in the air, but they are said to be able to take human form, or even the forms of snakes or winged creatures, visible only at the corner of your vision as they shoot past you. The djinn are thought to be able to possess humans and control their actions. It is believed that it was a malicious djinn who caused the prophet Maluk’s madness, in which he slaughtered his whole congregation. The most dangerous of the djinn, according to the prophet Hauram, is the efrite, who seeks out catacombs or space stations where corpses aren’t cremated in order to possess their inhabitants – living or dead.</p><p>As mentioned, not all djinn are evil – some of them can even be of great help. The Nine Muses, masters of all the arts of pleasure, are spirits often worshipped by courtesans who pray for success in their profession. The marids, or maajib, are arrogant djinn with almost Iconic powers who are said to grant wishes, if you can pay the price. The Silver Fox is a trickster spirit, thought by many to be an aspect of the Deckhand. It is said to dwell among forested hills, where it takes the form of a beautiful man or woman to lure unsuspecting travelers down into its hole. The guests are offered cups of chai or kawah and then bewitched, or possessed. Judicator Ahmedi testified to finding the bodies of several children in a hole in the ground just outside of the Conglomerate when the serial killer Atali roamed the planet. The hole also contained fox droppings. Ahmedi was so shaken by the whole affair that he turned in his badge and went to lead an ascetic’s life in the jungle.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SYMPTOMS OF A POSSESSION</h4><p>When an evil djinn possesses a human, there is precious little time to call for a preacher to perform an exorcism. The signs of a possession can be many, but in some cases it is only a high fever.</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong>:</p><ul><li>Lingering pain in different parts of the body, even though the medicurgs can find nothing wrong.</li><li>Hallucinations.</li><li>Depression.</li><li>Cannot stand to hear the holy scriptures or the creed being recited.</li><li>Constant nightmares, for example about black dogs, cats, snakes etc.</li><li>Mood swings.</li><li>High fever and disorientation.</li></ul></div><h4>SORCERERS</h4><p>Apart from spirits and djinn, there are many other stories about the dark arts in the Horizon. Parents on Kua and Coriolis scare their children with tales of the man-eating spirits that primitive Firstcome called sarcofagoi. In other versions, the sarcofagoi are spirits who infiltrate spaceships on long hauls, turning the crew against each other and sowing madness. When the crew has finally killed each other in their mania, the sarcofagoi feast on their corpses. Other sorcerer figures in folklore are the bokor, who can reanimate dead cadavers. They are said to hang around slums and tent towns in cities such as Akhander-O-Sharif and the Conglomerate. When it comes to the now extinct faction, the Nazareem’s Sacrifice, the worst evils imaginable are mixed with a certain amount of truth. It is commonly believed that they practiced human sacrifice, performed dark rituals, and formed unholy alliances with evil spirits and djinn.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>BAIJAM’S FALSE FACE</h5><p>Baijam’s False Face is a well-known myth in the Third Horizon. It is a story about the ability to change one’s face, which is an act most believers would think utterly depraved and heretical. Some religious ideas locate a person’s spirit or ghost in the lines of the face, or as Hauram’s third book declares: “Without your eyes and your smile, you are alone before the Icons”. Some say that Baijam is a darkmorph, a daimon, djinn, or diyub, that through changing the face of its possessed host can steal the ghost. Others believe that Baijam is actually one of the black sector’s most successful biosculpts, designed for infiltration and assassinations. The fact that Bajiam is an anagram from Maajib, which means both “shadow” and “master” and happens to be the name of the biocode magistra from Ahalimm that recently went missing only serves to further the whispered speculations. It is rumored that Maajib created the sculpt for a traveling tarrab, as a masterpiece to complete her training under master Herodes Afrat</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/Kapitel_7_mystik.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"XHSE50XCsQEsHQuX","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266276,"modifiedTime":1680376266276,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"P4y6Q0Bhyfv8yCko"}

The captain and the first officer, both now dead, have code keys giving access to the weapons. The keys also give their users higher security clearance when interacting with Suleiman, reducing the difficulty of the data djinn test required to obtain information from the computer. Another reason to visit the bridge could be to retrieve the emerald disc containing the ship’s essential logs that can be found there. The information on the disc could help piece together what actually happened before the PCs woke up. It is common salvage practice to try to retrieve the emerald disc from derelict ships, something which is known to many onboard, as well as by Suleiman.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>Blasting through the bulkhead door from the inside is impossible with the tools found onboard. As much of the section around the bridge is badly damaged, the only way inside is across the hull. The ED technology has temporarily restored the atmosphere inside the bridge, while still allowing for passage in and out through the hole in the hull by a person in an exo suit. Inside the ED field, one may act normally and remove one’s exo. The bulkhead door can be opened from the inside, and only one PC has to trek across the hull and enter the bridge from the outside.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/kommandobrygga.webp\" /></div><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The bridge contains three dead bodies. There should be more, but the others have likely been sucked out into space through the breach in the hull. The bodies are in bad shape – first officer Shanaz Po is strapped into her chair and the corpses of captain Ia Kaschares and colonial agent Nakifa are tangled up in a mess of cables near the breach. The ID cards of the captain and first officer Po can be used as keys for the arms locker. If the PCs can’t find the ID cards, they must hack the lock (technology, –2 without a security tablet). Failure means no guns. Critical success means accomplishing the task faster than expected (see Keeping track of time on page 8 @JournalEntry[Introduction - Ghazali]).</p><p>A communicator on one of the walls repeats a distorted message:</p><p><em>”Warning! Anomaly on entry – unidentified sensor object. Hull breach in section 12. Thrusters are offline. Stasis chamber is offline. Unstable field pattern. Decompression in sections 3, 6, 8, 19. Reactor spike. Activating emergency protocols – firing aft probes…”</em></p><p>The screen goes black for a few seconds, after which the message begins again. The message comes from the Ghazali’s Legion escort, the Zafirah, via a probe that was fired back before the liner made its jump. The ominous warning is repeated over and over, but contains no more data. More data can be found on the Ghazali’s emerald disc, but it must be retrieved and analyzed elsewhere (science).</p><p>Suleiman will point out that the emerald disc should be a priority if the PCs head for the bridge. It is easy to get at, and Suleiman can instruct them on how to remove it safely. It is an oblong disc, twenty centimeters wide and one centimeter thick. It is encrypted using the Colonial Agency’s decryption technology, which is unbreakable to everyone onboard, probably even to Suleiman (who will refuse to try if asked). The secrets of the green disc will remain out of reach for the rest of the scenario. From the bridge, the PCs can contact Suleiman again. If they have acquired either the captain’s or the first officer’s ID cards, their new security clearance gives them a +2 to their data djinn test when interacting with the computer.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>CLUES FOR THE MERCY OF THE ICONS CAMPAIGN</h4><p>The message from the Zafirah is a clue to the Mercy of the Icons campaign indicating that the ship was attacked, rather than damaged by the jump itself. Read more about the emerald disc on page 3 @JournalEntry[Introduction - Ghazali].</p></div><h4>THE BRIDGE</h4><p>The Ghazali’s navigation and central computers can be found on the bridge.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE GHAZALI’S SYSTEM COMMUNICATOR</h5><p>The liner’s system communicator can be found on the bridge. It has been damaged but can temporarily be restored by successfully testing TECHNOLOGY. If the PCs use it to transmit an emergency message, they establish contact with the ice hauler Tsepo IV. Both the PCs and captain Madjer of the hauler soon realize that help is too far out, however, and won’t arrive in time…</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STAIRWELL AND BULKHEAD DOOR</h5><p>Two spiral staircases lead to a locked bulkhead door. It can only be opened from inside the bridge. The only way inside is for (at least) one PC to spacewalk from the nearby airlock into the bridge and open the door from there.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BRIDGE</h5><p>A large room housing the liner’s central command node. Handwoven rugs cover the floors and the walls are tastefully decorated with hand painted, religious motifs. A search of the bridge reveals a tag with 780 birr, a transactor with 1,250 birr, and a personal holo communicator.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>USING A SHIP TO REACH THE BRIDGE</h5><p>The PCs may wish to use their ship to reach the bridge after their computer has been reconfigured. There is a cloud of debris floating outside the bridge, approaching safely requires a successful PILOT test. Failure results in the ship suffering a strength 4 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 3). The last stretch requires an exo suit as they will have to jump from their ship in through the breach at the bridge (DEXTERITY).</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARMS LOCKER</h5><p>Arms for the crew as well as any weapons taken off passengers are kept in a large, grey metal cabinet on the bridge, with floral engravings on the sides. Pistols and ammunition are on the top shelf, carbines and batons hang below. Suleiman cannot open the locker, but knows that the captain and the first officer would have had key cards. Otherwise, the PCs will have to hack the lock.</p><p><strong>The cabinet contains:</strong></p><ul><li>The PCs’ weapons, if they relinquished any when the boarded the liner</li><li>Two Vulcan pistols with four reloads each</li><li>Eleven shock sticks with two cells each</li><li>Eleven Vulcan carbines with eight reloads each</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"_id":"YznLA5orWWIuIck8","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252676,"modifiedTime":1680376252676,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"W11hfVbJtZWbfYpM","sort":0,"_id":"PaCvhWjY8MMPZUzg"}

Via the ancient portal fields, interstellar travel connects the people of the Horizon through commerce and cultural exchange. Mankind has called the Horizon its home for five centuries now, and since the Portal Wars ended just over a hundred years ago, its only home. Songs, poems and books still recount the memories of what came before, however - the Third Horizon is not the first place mankind colonized.</p><h4>THE THREE HORIZONS</h4><p>When mankind left Al-Ardha, taking its first hesitant steps out into the universe, hundreds upon hundreds of simple vessels departed for unknown destinations beyond the big black. Most were never heard from again, a few reported having found only empty star systems or uninhabitable planets, their missions failures. But then, a lone ship returned with the news that they had found a strange artifact of unknown construction, and the fate of humanity was forever changed. The expedition, the names of its crew long lost in the fog of the past, had found a star portal.</p><p>When the full importance of the discovery became clear, new worlds suddenly lay before the feet of mankind. The cluster of stars that waited only a portal jump away was named the First Horizon. The ruling powers of Al-Ardha wasted no time – one by one, the newly accessible stars were colonized. Earth-like planets were discovered. Humanity established itself as a spacefaring civilization once and for all. A while later, the Second Horizon was discovered. A new wave of colonists conquered it, world by world. Centuries passed, and what had started as a new golden age slowly turned into something else. Few details have survived to this day, but it is clear that a schism arose between the two Horizons. Eventually, a Third Horizon was discovered, giving hope of refuge to those who wanted to escape the older Horizons' increasingly monolithic cultures.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE PORTAL BUILDERS</h4><p>The origins of the portals and their creators are unknown. That the portals were engineered by some highly intelligent beings is beyond questioning, but no remains found anywhere give any clues as to the hidden architects' appearance, or even when they lived. The Portal Builders, as they are usually called, are veiled in mystery. Many theories exist of course, substantiated to varying degrees. Some researchers believe them to be an ancient human civilization, others that they were envoys of some omnipotent intelligence.</p></div><h4>THE Firstcome</h4><p>The first to arrive in the Third Horizon were fortune seekers, religious dissidents and rebels – none of them had any love for the empire-builders of the First Horizon, or any means of competing for resources in the rapidly overcrowding Second Horizon. Some of them would permanently put their mark on the Third Horizon: the group that eventually became the Order of the Pariah, the colonists who founded the beautiful cities on Mira, and the Odacon dynasty are some examples. The Firstcome laid the foundation for the Third Horizon of today, colonizing the larger systems, building magnificent cities and creating a free and tolerant new order. It was the Firstcome who introduced the Third Horizon to the Icons and the Dark between the Stars; today it’s the region’s largest religion. It was a civilized era. There was peace and commerce between the peoples, cultures flourished and evolved. But like all good things, the peace couldn’t last forever.</p><h4>THE PORTAL WARS</h4><p>How and why the Portal Wars began, no one really knows anymore. Some historians believe that rebel groups wished to end the imperialism of the First Horizon, others that the wars were only a tragic side effect of a conflict between the two older Horizons. There are even those who claim that the First and Second Horizons started the wars together, with the intention of isolating the Third Horizon and leaving it to crumble in the empty void. When the wars began, the armadas and servants of the first two Horizons were spread all over the Third Horizon, but after a long and bloody campaign, the peoples of the Third Horizon, with the fleets of the Order of the Pariah leading the charge, managed to push their remaining enemies into the affluent Odacon system.</p><p>The final battle above Odacon ended in disaster – whole fleets and eventually the entire system were destroyed. The Order and the Third Horizon emerged victorious, but paid a terrible price for it: the portals back to the older Horizons collapsed, ending communication and trade forever. The peoples of the Third Horizon were now alone. A recession followed immediately after the end of the war. With the supply of important resources from the older Horizons cut off, general standards of living plunged.</p><h4>THE LONG NIGHT</h4><p>An age of darkness, isolation, and decay began. The portals connecting the systems of the Third Horizon still worked, but trade diminished rapidly. Many cultures became planet-bound. The dream of the stars that had been realized for such a short time was again just a dream. The advanced technology that many of the Horizon’s wonders relied upon was forgotten, cities and outposts fell, and civilization receded. The Long Night, as this period is known today, was an era without progress and with a declining population. Here and there, lights in the darkness struggled on: the university in the Icon City that never shut its doors, the temple city of Lotus in perpetual bloom, the Order’s regime on Zalos that held their own against the dark with vigilance and strict discipline. But these are the exceptions – the story of the Long Night is one of famine, plague and despair – whole cultures vanished in the sands of time. The peoples feared that darkness had arrived to stay – until a strange ship suddenly arrived in the Dabaran system.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>MEMORIES OF HORIZONS LOST</h5><p>Few, if any, today still remember the First or Second Horizons. Rumors would have it that some ascetics, like the God Child of the cliffs of Garuda, are old enough to tell stories of the lost Horizons, but most people in the Third Horizon nowadays are too busy with current affairs to fantasize about the old days. Not even the crew of Zenith can really say much – the portals were not even discovered when they left their dying world. The songs about Al-Ardha, the lost home, are few but colorful – they tell of cities covering whole continents, towers so high they reached the atmosphere and an impossibly blue sky, beautiful beyond description.</p></div><h4>ZENITH AND NADIR</h4><p>Over a millennia ago, the desperate rulers of Al-Ardha gazed dreaming towards the distant stars, and one of those stars was Dabaran. Two gigantic ships took off, headed for the red giant. The twin colossi were named Zenith and Nadir, and onboard they carried colonists meant to settle in the system now called Dabaran. The colonists were in stasis, cryo-sleep, several hundred thousand per ship. The fate of the crew was different however – through the generations they remained awake, tending to the ship and its sleeping passengers in the quiet, starry night.</p><p>From time to time, the crew would also go into stasis for a few years, but essentially they lived and died at the post to which their family had been appointed. The captain family Quassar, the helmsmen of the Yriedes clan and many other families in essential crew positions, saw birth, life and death on the bridge of the Zenith. Their voyage lasted nearly a full millennia, and at some point towards the end, contact with Nadir was lost. Alone, Zenith finally arrived in the Dabaran system to assess the conditions for colonization. They found that the system definitively could support human life – and that it already did. Mankind had already colonized the systems around the red giant more than five hundred years earlier!</p><h4>THE ZENITHIANS</h4><p>What the astounded crew of the Zenith discovered were thirty-six linked star systems, homes to a myriad of scattered outposts and colonies. The cults, orders and tribes that lived across the Horizon were largely without interest in communicating with each other, or lacked the technology to do so. The occasional contact that did occur was mainly in the form of repression or outright war. The crew of the Zenith, called the “Late-come” by the old colonists and “Zenithians” by themselves, traveled the Third Horizon for a long time while trying to agree on what to do next, eventually putting their ship in orbit above Kua as the discussion intensified.</p><p>The heart of the issue was what to do now that their colonization directive seemed pointless. The crew kept the colonists in stasis as they debated their future. The captain family, the Quassars, proposed to carry out the mission despite the new situation, while others, led by the Yriedes family, argued that everyone should be free to decide for themselves – the directives were redundant and thus, the contract void. A third faction within the crew lost patience as the discussions dragged on, and woke the colonists from stasis on their own. The traitors, now called the Draconite faction, left the ship in the chaos of the awakening.</p><h4>THE FOUNDING OF CORIOLIS</h4><p>Complete disorder seemed imminent, and the captain of the Zenith, Abarren Quassar, responded to the threat of mutiny by offering all crew and colonists the choice to go wherever they pleased and to bring with them the resources they needed for survival at their destinations. The Quassar family themselves descended to the planet below and founded a colony there, on and around the Monolith. The newly awakened colonists quickly formed gangs and groups, choosing leaders mainly from the crew, who had more knowledge of the situation. Some factions left to found colonies in other systems, but many remained in the Kua system. The remains of the Zenith became the basis for the construction of a giant space station – Coriolis – dominated from the very beginning by the Yriedes clan and their faction, the Consortium.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch8/strid_nuläge.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"ZkqWZvWpE6G1NDDG","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266544,"modifiedTime":1680376266544,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"JHNjQqC358FGGTXd","sort":0,"_id":"QKZ6zf1F6GtYaKwC"}

The station lies at the intersection of all the major trade routes, and houses both the Council of Factions and many other rulers.</h3><p><strong>When the Zenithians</strong> stripped their arkship for parts and created the colossus that would become Coriolis station, they had no idea what it would mean to the Horizon. During the first cycles of the station’s existence, many areas were empty and uninhabited. Over time, the station filled up with activity and experienced a cultural boom – while decaying at the same time. From the deep echoes of the Cellar to the floors in the Spire mimicking real planetary nature under blue holo skies, the Coriolis of today is a melting pot of Algolan refugees, masked Sadaalian bureaucrats, and wealthy pashas from Sivas and Dabaran.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">FACTS ABOUT THE STATION</div><ul><li><strong>POPULATION</strong>: According to the census of CC61, Coriolis has 521,465 permanent residents. The number of occupants with temporary residence permits was at the time of the census 189,453. Semi-intelligences and slummers in the Cellar were not included in the census, but their numbers are kept low by the purges of the Coriolis Guard.</li><li><strong>PHYSICAL</strong> DATA: The station measures 6,136 meters from the Cellar to the top of the Spire. The diameter of the Ring is 3,540 meters and that of the Core is 1,500 meters at its widest point. The four larger plazas are 604 meters in diameter.</li><li><strong>CALENDAR</strong>: One Coriolis Cycle is divided into 336 days. Each day is divided into watches of six hours each – morning, day, evening, and night. The cycle is divided into nine 37-day segments, each devoted to one Icon. Each segment ends with an extended rest period, and after each triad – three segments – a special holiday is celebrated. The three holidays are the Founding, the Cyclade (or New Year’s Eve), and the Pilgrimaria.</li><li><strong>LAW AND ORDER</strong>: The Coriolis Guard is the keeper of the peace, both on the station and in the surrounding space, and is under the direct control of the Governor. The Judicators, who have extensive authority to investigate, make arrests, and, in some cases, punish the guilty parties at the scene of the crime, handle serious criminality. The Judicators answer to the courts, who are independent from the Governor and the Council, but who rule in accordance with the laws of the station.</li><li><strong>GOVERNANCE</strong>: The Governor rules the station with the help of the Council of Factions and the will of the taxpayers through the 2,001 seats of the Popular Assembly. Taxes are optional, and are usually paid collectively by a company, clan, or other group to get a vote on the Assembly, but a number of wealthy individuals also hold seats – 732 people as of CC61. The price of a vote on the Assembly was 9,000 birr in CC61. The Popular Assembly votes on issues where the Governor and the Council need the support of the people. The Assembly always gets to vote in legislative matters.</li></ul><h4>HISTORY</h4><p>The Coriolis station was constructed from the corpse of the arkship Zenith that arrived in the Third Horizon some 60 cycles ago. Portions of the Zenith’s components and gear were taken by the Quassar family down to the Monolith on Kua, and some went with the Draconites when they broke the chain of command onboard and vanished into the void. Left in the remnants were the seconds-in-command, the Yriedes clan, and the newly awoken colonists who together formed the Consortium. Coriolis was constructed as a signal to the entire Horizon that a new era was dawning – and because it was a practical use of the Zenith’s cadaver. The leftovers became the Net, the reloading port that floats outside the station. In a show of Zenithian fellowship, Coriolis was parked in a geostationary orbit above the Monolith, with the Spire pointing towards the top of the black column below.

A few of them are described below. More information can be found on the map of the Third Horizon.</p><h4>AMEDO</h4><p>The binary Amedo system is mainly known for the large number of skavara living on the planet of the same name, roaming across a whole continent in large tribes and packs. Nowadays, the native semi-intelligences share the planet with colonists in cities spread around a large archipelago. Amedo’s white island temples are known across the entire Horizon. Closely orbiting the smaller Amedo-B, also known as Ekharan, is a strange planetary body called the Eye of Ekharan. The Eye is a perfect ellipse with a transverse axis of exactly 1,100 km. Since the observations of the Eye began, its orbit has stayed constant. That the Eye is no natural phenomenon is obvious to anyone.</p><h4>MENKAR</h4><p>At the end of the Third Horizon lies Menkar. Only the most stubborn of free traders and the most curious of archaeologists and scientists ever come out this far. But Menkar is the home of the Horizon’s second monolith. It looks just like the monolith on Kua, and was likewise inhabited by humans a long time ago. It rises high above the dangerous wilderness below and this made it a logical place to settle. Today, much of its buildings lie in ruins and the rest are scarcely populated. A while back, the monolith suddenly moved and tilted over to its current position, and thousands were killed as their houses fell to the ground. The river delta surrounding the pillar is full of light globes and the area has a reputation for being ripe with artifacts. Scientists come to Menkar in the hopes of learning more about portals from observing the unpredictable fields in the system. There are hopes and theories about possibly opening the Third Horizon towards an unknown Fourth one from Menkar, but no one has been successful so far.</p><h4>HAMURA</h4><p>Kua’s neighbor Hamura saw quite a lot of traffic until the incident in Taoan. Today, traffic through the system stops only at the Hamurabi portal station where the Foundation, the Consortium, and the Colonial Agency all keep a presence. The system’s inhabitants come to Hamurabi to trade or to work on servicing the warships from the Legion and the Order that have been stationed here.</p><h4>TAOAN</h4><p>Whatever it is that is happening in Taoan is being kept secret. Overzealous admirals commanding mighty battleships and Martyr cruisers guard the portals in Hamura and Uharu. The surrounding space is crowded with attack drones from the Legion and antimatter-powered injectors from the Order of the Pariah. Before all the commotion in the system, Taoan harbored a gas mine circling the gas giant with the same name. Something went wrong, and contact with the mine was lost. Rumors have it that terrible beings from the darkness, or even a group of Emissaries, were behind the disaster.</p><h4>UHARU</h4><p>Uharu is known for its rebels, its Dabaran colonies, and the asteroid refineries the Consortium runs here. The brown dwarf that has given its name to the system has about twenty moons circling it, several of them with biotopes and exotic fauna. The system was a goldmine to the Firstcome colonists that settled here, but the rich supply of natural resources soon attracted Dabaran entrepreneurs and eventually the Colonial Agency. The newcomers tried to take over the system and, today, more or less open war rages across several of the different ice and forest moons. The lava-covered moon Pyre orbits close to the brown dwarf in a magnetic flux tube, and the Foundation has founded a small base here to study magnetic fields.</p><h4>NHARMADA</h4><p>The Nharmada system is somewhat special in that several planets orbit the third and, counting from the portals, most distant star in the system. This red giant has four natural satellites, but current theories speculate that the dying star has already absorbed at least three planets and that the rest will eventually follow. The system has a small population of mainly Firstcome tribes that operate more or less profitable metal and mineral mines in the so-called Three Colonies – on Gudwara, Zaynad and in the Serpent Belt, respectively. Different alliances of warlords rule the system, offering some protection for the inhabitants in exchange for them signing long contracts of servitude.</p><h4>YASTAPOL</h4><p>The distant Yastapol system is mostly just empty space. What sticks out in the system is the giant shipyards that have given name to the star. The yards are owned and run by the head of the Yastapol family, executive director Anastasiya din-Yastapol. That the shipyards were constructed in Yastapol of all places is explained by the huge wreckage belt that can be found here, possibly even pre-dating the Portal Wars. The belt is dangerous to maneuver through, but full of old ships, some of them in remarkably good shape. Salvage ships from the yards come to the belt and cannibalize the ships for parts to bring back. These parts are then assembled into robust but ugly ships, and sold for a good profit. Freelance scrapper crews have started to show up over the last few years to get their piece of the action, and the Colonial Agency have also begun to show an interest.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch13/dabaran_rymdskepp.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"NZbukEYSX0qXH898","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266867,"modifiedTime":1680376266867,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"RJCp742JGP4Fls5N"}

The ship hangs like a dead parasite on its host body, content with its imminent disintegration. Suleiman’s calm voice breaks the silence to inform them that they have seven minutes to reach the minimum safe distance from the Ghazali.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>If the PCs turn to Suleiman for help, he informs them that there appears to be a flaw in the ignition sequence softw they can escape, temporary repairs to the main ignition computer must be made. It can be done from the bridge and requires a successful data djinn test at +1. The prayer re-roll will probably come in handy here. If they pass the roll, they have saved themselves and a ship full of desperate rescue workers. As soon as the ignition sequence has been restored, they speed away from the Ghazali with just enough time to spare to make it to a safe distance. The liner vanishes in a flash of light behind them. Trembling and tasting blood, they are finally safe, with nothing more to do than to sit down, have a cup of steaming rose water, and wait for the Hamurabi portal station to show up on their sensors.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>It could be an interesting twist to let sabotage be the reason behind the faulty ignition sequence. If this is the case, it should be easily recognizable to the PCs. An NPC (Sabetha Pour, Komoro Vai, or perhaps even Koria Yohares) might secretly have managed to repair another ship and wants to make sure the PCs perish with the Ghazali. The PCs spot another ship departing from a dock nearby and disappearing into space. After repairing the ignition sequence, the PCs may want to pursue the saboteurs, which could lead to a grand finale for the scenario involving space combat!</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>The hidden malfunction is a story tool you can use to really put pressure on the players. Should all of the PCs fail the data djinn test, however, have an NPC (Sabetha Pour, Koria Yohares, Komoro Vai, or someone else) repair the ignition sequence for them. It wouldn’t feel right if the PCs all died because of one failed roll after making it this far. A failed roll should have consequences, however. The other passengers might for example give credit for the entire evacuation to the NPC who repaired the ignition, or they might turn on one of the PCs, giving her the blame for almost getting everybody killed.</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>If you haven’t gotten your players sweating enough already, some final events can be thrown in to increase tension even further. Perhaps some nekatra make it onboard the ship and attack the PCs, or an NPC might panic at the sight of the PCs’ clumsy attempts at repairing the ignition sequence, demanding to take over. Hostile NPCs may try to use the desperate situation to stage a mutiny and remove the PCs as heads of the evacuation!</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"7x4DNc8JV2IPR6DB","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252159,"modifiedTime":1680376252159,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"TSnpm6L8AX87lGCO","sort":0,"_id":"RZWhN7YxHlXsrHfR"}

This chapter details star travel in the Third Horizon, how to create your own spaceship, and how space combat works.</h3><h4>STAR TRAVEL IN THE THIRD HORIZON</h4><p>Star travel in the Third Horizon requires both steady nerves and plenty of time – how long the trip will take can be affected by anything from corsair attacks and asteroid fields to the immense distances of binary or trinary star systems. No captain should leave port without doing solid research about the route. Help is provided by the Bulletin’s Astrostradium – an enormous database describing a large number of routes, coordinates and space stations all across the Horizon. Interplanetary travel times can also vary greatly depending on the orbit of the planet you are traveling to.<br />Chapter 12 describes the minimum distances from the sun to the planets in the Kua system. Spaceflights are rarely longer than the shortest distance between the planetary bodies, as the pilots will chart courses toward their destinations’ approaching orbits. Thus, the ship and the planet are moving towards each other. Calculate travel times using the shortest distance listed between two planets.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE BULLETIN’S ASTROSTRADIUM</h5><p>The section of the Consortium tasked with gathering information about star systems is called the Foundation, but it is the Bulletin, through its Astrostradium, that supplies captains with data about routes, portal stations, space ports, astronomical anomalies and other useful information. For a small fee, any ship can update its astronical database at a portal station. Unfortunately, the data is not always up to date, and an unlucky crew could find itself in an ion storm or a corsair ambush even on a “safe” route.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/portalhopp.webp\" /></div><h4>TRAVEL BETWEEN SYSTEMS</h4><p>Travel between systems is via the portals – mysterious wormholes left behind by the Portal Builders (read more in Chapter 13). The portals are found close to the sun of each system, closer than any of the planetary orbits. Some stars have more than one portal, each one leading to a different system. The entry field into a portal is not the same as the exit field; they lead to and from the same destination but are separate from each other.</p><p>Travel between two portals in a system takes about one day, and the preparations before the jump also take about a day – usually spent waiting for a convoy to come along to split the jump fee with. The jump itself is instantaneous. Heavily trafficked systems like Kua usually see one or two convoys per week, while convoys in the outer systems could be whole segments (p 232) apart.</p><p>Bulk haulers are the highest priority for the portal stations and are cleared to jump straight away. They usually arrive at Kua once per segment, on the way to or from either Mira or Dabaran. One in five bulk haulers have Kua as their final destination, the rest only pass through. Smaller ships dock and unload some of their cargo as the space hulks pass by. The Kua portals are 3 AU apart, a journey the bulk haulers make in three days, but smaller vessels do much faster.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>CALCULATING TRAVEL TIMES</h4><p>Interplanetary distances are measured in Astronomical Units (AU). The distance between two planets is calculated like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Shortest distance</strong>: The difference between the planets’ individual distances from the sun.</li><li><strong>Farthest distance</strong>: The sum of the planets’ individual distances from the sun.</li><li>Divide the distance in AU by the spaceship’s speed to get the travel time (in number of days).</li></ul></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>COMMUNICATION DELAYS</h5><p>Communication waves travel at the speed of light, which is roughly one AU per eight minutes – thus, getting a reply to a question takes at least 16 minutes per AU between you and the other party. No communication waves can pass through portals. Instead, a ship or a probe must make the jump and then transmit the message on the other side. This leads to great communication delays between systems. The Bulletin keeps multiple probes ready on every portal station, and anyone can pay to use them to send information. This is both expensive and not without risk however, as you never know who might be listening on the other end.</p></div><h4>PORTAL JUMPS</h4><p>Jumping through a portal means traveling into the portal fields close to the sun of the system. Exactly how the portal fields function is unknown, but their proximity to the stars would indicate that they are powered by the stars’ radiation or gravitation. The portal fields themselves are in constant movement, seemingly connected to the phases of their suns. Advanced mathematics are necessary before any portal jump to compute the field’s current size, and a safe entry vector. Without such calculations, there is a great risk of only partly hitting the field – for the unlucky crew this means an instant of bright light, after which the ship simply disappears, or at the very least suffers enormous damage.</p><p>No human can travel through a portal field while awake. The crew must be put in stasis (cryogenic sleep), or they will suffer terrible mental and physical trauma (called “bad stasis”, “hyper sickness” or “frostbite”), if they are unlucky enough to survive. On voyages through several systems, most of the crew is left in stasis for the entire time and only woken up at the final destination. In dangerous systems, such as Odacon, all of the crew is woken up after clearing the jump.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>PORTAL JUMPING</h4><ul><li><strong>FEES AND CONVOYS</strong>. For a price, the portal stations can calculate the portal fields’ movements and current size, making the jump relatively safe. The fees are usually high, between 5,000 and 10,000 birr, which means most skippers prefer to share the cost by forming convoys and jumping together. Portal jumps with coordinates calculated for a convoy gives a +3 to the pilot’s PILOT test.</li><li><strong>BULK HAULERS</strong>. Another way to jump is to wait for a bulk hauler to come by and jump alongside it. The haulers always get their coordinates and entry vectors on approaching the portal station, and tagging along with them is free, but requires an Easy (+1) PILOT test. Unfortunately, bulk hauler jumps are few and far between.</li><li><strong>SOLO JUMP</strong>. The broke skipper’s last resort is to have the ship’s crew itself make all jump calculations. This takes about four hours and requires a successful SCIENCE test. Each extra six reduces the time by one hour (to a minimum of one hour). The jump itself requires a PILOT test at -1.</li><li><strong>JUMPING BLIND</strong>. The truly desperate, often corsairs on the run and other criminals, can choose to jump blind, without any astronical calculations.

All ships must make preparations for atmospheric entry or take-off. This includes warming up the graviton projectors, securing the cargo and adjusting heat shields. Most freighters in the Third Horizon are too big for it to be practical for them to land planetside, instead docking with space stations in orbit above the planet where they unload their cargo to smaller vessels. Orbit ports are found above most planets with large enough populations, while systems with fewer inhabitants instead rely on spaceports on the portal stations.</p><p>In the orbit ports, cargo from the bulk haulers is redistributed to smaller spaceships and then brought down to the surface below. Some cargo is put up for auction (usually in planetside souks) where free traders bid on contracts for transporting it to colonies and space stations farther from the hub of the system. Systems on the periphery of the Horizon, outside of the circle of Dabaran and the Miran chain, are not visited by bulk haulers at all.</p><hr /><ul><li>@JournalEntry[Spacecraft in the Third Horizon]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Create Your Ship]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Space Combat]</li><li>@JournalEntry[Space Combat Example]</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"_id":"58XfdDfclpxNsoTz","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265366,"modifiedTime":1680784939511,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"nRFV3m3MEAgKsrne","sort":0,"_id":"SNtVNZ13kPIWtYMg"}

All are probably inhabited, but one cannot be completely sure about a few of them. Some systems see traffic only by way of the portals. Only six systems have large populations: Algol, Dabaran, Kua, Mira, Zalos and Sadaal. The busier routes connect these six systems. The populations in the other systems vary in size depending on the number of planets, the luminosity of the stars and a range of other factors. Many systems house human life only in relay stations, small colonies, outposts or prospector camps – and corsair nests, of course.</p><h4>THE PORTALS</h4><p>The so-called portals are actually fields without any physical structure, made up of exotic particles and waves. Foundation professor Yaqub Fazari believes that the fields can be understood and described mathematically, and when this has been achieved, the people of the Horizon will be able to create new portals. However, this is all just a theory so far. When a ship passes through a portal, it is instantly transported to the next. Each field links two star systems together and jumps can be made both ways, simultaneously and without risk of collision. Jehna Karmathe, the noted Dabaran philosopher, teaches that no two things can happen anywhere at the same time in the universe, and that this explains why parallel passage is safe, but that level of philosophical detail is not something normal skippers care about.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DANGERS OF THE PORTALS</h5><p>One major problem with the star portals is that they aren’t stable. Complicated algorithms and sequences are used to calculate the flux of the field and a good entry vector, and getting the math wrong can lead to the ship being torn apart or swallowed by the field, never to be seen again. A second problem is that no living creature can portal jump while awake without suffering serious neurological and mental damage. Stasis technology is required to provide some measure of safety for the crew during a jump. The factions are devoting massive funding into research about ways to get around this, but no one has succeeded so far. The last problem is the jump itself. No one knows exactly what happens in the moment when the ship makes the jump, but according to folklore, evil djinni and other darkmorphs hunt in the vicinity of the portals. There are stories about whole crews waking up from their frozen slumber possessed by unspeakable things from the Dark between the Stars.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE PORTAL JUMP</h5><p>Because of the dangers and the complicated calculations, preparing for a portal jump takes about a day. To facilitate easier jumping and to prevent accidents, portal stations have been constructed close to all of the portals. The crew of the portal station aids the skippers in calculating the size of the fields, making for quicker preparations, but at a hefty cost. Since several ships can use one entry vector, jumping in groups to share the cost is common. It is not certain exactly how many ships can use the same coordinates – it depends on the flux of the field and the will of the Icons – but no one wants to go last.</p><p>The portal stations are also small oases for bored crews and somewhere to make repairs. Larger stations even have vacuum docks for proper service. Poor skippers can wait at the station for other ships to come along to share the jump fee with, or jump solo – using self-calculated coordinates, or piggybacking on another ship. This is both risky and illegal, however. The solo jumper could end up at the edge of the field, collide with the other ships or get too close to their graviton exhausts.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 13.1 STAR SYSTEMS IN THE THIRD HORIZON</h4><p>Below is a list of all the systems in the Horizon.

The sole survivor of Baghra’s expedition has just returned to Coriolis in possession of a curious statuette, and gone into hiding. The antiques dealer-turned-Syndicate-middleman Merez Alcan has heard of the valuable artifact and needs help finding it.</h3><p><strong>The statuette of Zhar Baghra</strong> is a mini scenario that is designed as an introduction to Coriolis – The Third Horizon. The scenario will give you a first taste of the mighty Coriolis space station with a possible aftermath and more adventures waiting in the Terenganu Valley scenario location.</p><h4>BACKGROUND</h4><p>The portal researcher Zhar Baghra was an eccentric scientist who recently put together an expedition to the jungles of Kua to set up an excavation in Terenganu Valley. Something went wrong, and no one has heard from Baghra or the expedition in the last segment. The expedition met their gruesome fate in the deep caverns underneath the Terenganu plateau. Ancient Portal Builder artifacts unleashed their lethal powers, and the only survivor was the young archaeologist Lavim Tamm who fled the caves and hid in the safety of the dark jungle, bringing a statuette of alien design with him. The antiques dealer Merez Alcan has acquired forbidden high-tech, faction tech and illegal artifacts for the Syndicate for a long time, which in turn sells them at staggering prices. Merez is growing old and has begun thinking about retirement. Through his spies in Archaeology Alley, Merez has been informed about the return of Lavim Tamm from Kua and the statuette he is carrying. Merez cannot use his regular contacts for the job, so he hires external help – the PCs – to track down Lavim and the statuette. Unbeknownst to Merez, someone else is also looking for the statuette – a Draconite, seeking the artifact for the faction’s mystical rituals.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch15/fraktionär_kampanj_beskär.webp\" /></div><h4>THE BEGINNING OF THE SCENARIO</h4><p>The PCs are somewhere onboard Coriolis when they are contacted by Merez Alcan. They could be in a cantina (perhaps Wahib’s, the scenario location described below), in the loading bays below the spaceport, on one of the plazas or in a bar in the Mulukhad. The PCs have been recommended to Merez by his own contacts and not by their patron. He is very straightforward and asks if they would be willing to help him locate an object that is somewhere in the station. If the PCs are interested, he will describe the artifact as a Firstcome idol of the Dancer and says that he is interested in buying it from its current owner, the archaeologist Lavim Tamm.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>DARKNESS POINTS</h4><p>The GM gets 4 DP at the beginning of the scenario.</p></div><div class=\"blueheader\">MEREZ ALCAN</div>@Actor[Merez Alcan]<p>Merez offers the PCs compensation for their services, either in birr, gear or firearms. This is what he knows and can tell the PCs:</p><ul><li>The statuette is an idol of one of the Dancer’s incarnations, the Shadow Monkey. It is hideous, but very valuable. Merez can describe it in detail so the PCs will recognize it.</li><li>The archaeologist Lavim Tamm has disappeared, but was usually seen hanging around the Spice Plaza bazaar.</li><li>Lavim has a weakness for the Miran fire kohôl served at the White Tugur bar.</li></ul><h4>THE SPICE PLAZA BAZAAR</h4><p>The Spice Plaza bazaar is easy to find (page 251 @JournalEntry[The Ring]). Commerce is hectic here, and if the PCs ask around about Lavim, they won’t get many answers. If they mention Miran fire kohôl however, the spice vendors will smile roguishly and direct them towards the kohôl trader Abzir or the White Tugur bar. Abzir will recognize Lavim from the PCs description but can only tell them that he hasn’t been around for a while. The White Tugur’s matriarch Jasina (Empathy 3, Manipulation 3) is reluctant to share any information at first, but could be persuaded. As the PCs are talking to Jasina, they might spot Lavim’s friend Jinna (Agility 2, Infiltration 2, Dexterity 3) sneaking about the bazaar. Jinna has heard the PCs ask around about Lavim, and if she is discovered, she tries to flee through the crowds. The PCs can chase after her through the narrow alleys of the Promenade, and the GM could spend 1-3 DP to make the chase challenging for them (page 346 @JournalEntry[The Dark Between the Stars in the Game]). If they catch her, she can be manipulated to share the following:</p><ul><li>Lavim is hiding in an antiques shop in Archaeology Alley called Kaffrah’s Artifacts.</li><li>Lavim thinks he is being followed by someone (the Draconite Salindre).</li><li>Lavim didn’t bring any statuette back as far as Jinna knows</li></ul><p>If the PCs lose Jinna during the chase, they can get more information from Abzir or Jasina. Both can tell them that Lavim often visits Kaffrah’s Artifacts.</p><h4>THE ANTIQUES SHOP</h4><p>Archaeology Alley near the Spring Plaza is full of antique shops, curiosities and bookstores (page 253 @JournalEntry[The Ring]). It is almost always packed with people regardless of the hour. The only difference between the watches is that the already dusky alley becomes even shadier in the night – in every sense of the word. Finding Kaffrah’s Artifacts is easy if the PCs ask around, although most people will try to refer them to better establishments rather than waste their time with that quack Kaffrah.</p><p>In a narrow alley cluttered with clothes lines and the remains of a collapsed balcony, a weak, flickering sign will direct visitors down some stairs to Kaffrah’s Artifacts. When the PCs enter, the wrinkled, black-haired Kaffrah (Empathy 3, Manipulation 3) will greet them courteously, almost invisible under layers and layers of embroidered shawls. She won’t talk about Lavim at first, but after some persuasion and perhaps some birr (+1 to manipulation), she can tell the PCs this:</p><ul><li>Lavim came by the shop a few days ago carrying something small wrapped in cloth.</li><li>He didn’t want to tell her what it was and got angry when she asked. Then he left.</li><li>Since then she hasn’t seen him.</li><li>She can direct the PCs to the cheap boarding house at the top of the Promenade where he is staying (if they tip her well).</li></ul><p>If the PCs describe the statuette to Kaffrah she gets excited and if they haven’t been rude, she can tell them that it sounds a lot like the fabled statuette of Zhar Baghra. With this information the PCs should be able to figure out the background (page 347 @JournalEntry[The Statuette of Zhar]) by testing culture at -1.</p><p>When they leave Kaffrah’s, they can spot the Draconite Salindre following them if they are vigilant. If she is discovered by the PCs, she quickly escapes by climbing the walls of the alley and disappears up on the roof, wrapped in her chameleon suit.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">SALINDRE</div>@Actor[Salindre]<h4>“THE QUIET EUNUCH” BOARDING HOUSE</h4><p>At the very of top of the Promenade, just before the ventilation shafts and power lines take over, the PCs will find the flea-ridden boarding house ”The Quiet Eunuch”, owned and run by the eccentric Legionary veteran Silca Burros. Silca is anything but quiet and will show the PCs to Lavim’s coffin-like module right away. Inside they find Lavim, drunk.</p><p>If the PCs manipulate Lavim, he can tell them this:</p><ul><li>He is being followed. He wonders if it is by the PCs?</li><li>He doesn’t have the statuette, he hid it in a crack in one of the bridges across the Promenade.</li><li>The statuette is just one of many treasures left in the jungle.</li><li>He does have the coordinates to the excavation. They are on a tag that he hid with the statuette.</li><li>He can show them to the bridge.</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">OTHER WAYS TO THE QUIET EUNUCH</div><p>If the PCs aggravate Kaffrah or won’t give her any birr, there are other ways to find Lavim’s hideout at the boarding house.</p><ul><li>They can get the information from Jinna at the Spice Plaza.</li><li>They can catch Salindre and persuade her to help them. In this case she knows where Lavim is but hasn’t approached him yet.</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">LAVIM TAMM</div>@Actor[Lavim Tamm]<h4>THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE PROMENADE</h4><p>If the PCs contact Merez before going to get the tag on the bridge, he will set up a meeting with them there. If they haven’t contacted him, he will be there anyway, as he has had some Syndicate gang members tail them. Regardless of which, he will want the statuette and the coordinates immediately when he realizes that there are more treasures on Kua. He will then make a tag transfer of the payment to the PCs and back away. He could be persuaded to pay first and then get his prize. When he has the statuette and the tag, he orders the Syndicate thugs to attack the PCs. The PCs could get help from Salindre in the fight if things look bad, as she has followed them to the bridge. As GM you can guarantee Merez’s escape by spending 2 DP if you wish.</p><p>The bridge is built for transports and maintenance work on the shafts and lines between the blocks of the Ring. It has a low railing made from braided tubes and cables, and it is four meters wide by about twenty meters long. The dark drop below is shot through with cables and lines looking almost like a spider’s web. Falling from the bridge most likely means getting tangled up in the cables or landing on one of the balconies below.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">SYNDICATE GANG MEMBER</div>@Actor[Syndicate Gang Member]<h4>EPILOGUE</h4><p>The showdown at the bridge could end several ways: with Merez escaping or disappearing, but with the PCs still having the statuette (page 356 @JournalEntry[Terenganu Valley]) and coordinates. Or maybe the PCs manage to defeat the Syndicate thugs and Merez and hold onto the statuette. A possibility is that Merez succesfully escapes with the statuette and the PCs are only left with the coordinates.Will they share the coordinates or the statuette with Salindre? The Draconite could accept a tactical alliance with the PCs and pay them to help her beat Merez to the dig site on Kua. Will Merez try to stop them before they get off the station? Will he tell the Syndicate about his find, now that he must put together an expedition to the jungles? There are many ways the story could continue, both on Coriolis and in the neverending jungles of Kua, and it is your job as the GM to explore it with the group. If they follow the coordinates, they will end up in Terenganu Valley on the Kuan equator. Where further adventures awaits. A possible way for the story to continue can be found on the next page. Use this  as an inspiration or make up your own scenario.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"FB7N4KTQSdsG6aLW","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266932,"modifiedTime":1680376266932,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"bArkpH8OiKEDtwIk","sort":0,"_id":"SdsMdo7tTtivQlWN"}

The system is ruled by the Order of the Pariah, a faction with a split reputation for being both devout, helpful believers and bloodthirsty fanatics. Not much is known about Zalos as the Order is very strict about who they let in. What little common people in the Horizon know is usually based on rumors and third party sources, and those who actually have visited Zalos in recent years can only share their experiences of the City of Foreigners.</p><p>Zalos is a binary system with two habitable planets, one orbiting each star, Zalos and Zahedan. A third planet, Benagia, used to be inhabited, but it suffered such terrible bombardments during the Portal Wars that it is uninhabitable today. Several moons have been colonized, with Karrmerruk, orbiting Benagia, being the most famous. Many small space stations are also scattered across the system.</p><p>The Martyr Council, a constantly changing group of priests, prophets, grand masters and elders, governs the Order of the Pariah. Rumors claim that the Council lets archaic rites and divination decide how Zalos should be ruled. Regardless of their practice, the Martyr Council is the dominant political force in the system, and they are seldom contradicted.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch13/skeppsport2.webp\" /></div><p class=\"centerJournalText\">A monastery cruiser landing at Joh Narida on Zalos</p><h4>THE WAR ON HERESY</h4><p>The largest conflict in Zalos is the civil war raging across all of Zahedan. Large portions of the planet’s population have succumbed to heresy and started worshipping false prophets. They have left the embrace of the Martyr and taken up arms against their former brothers and sisters. The war is everywhere and very bloody, with everything from small guerilla raids to full-scale military campaigns. The Order focuses much of its resources on crushing the rebels, but has so far not been successful. Both sides in the conflict possess advanced antimatter weapons, golim armors and bionics that don’t exist outside of Zalos, making them evenly matched. If it wasn’t for the total fleet blockade around Zahedan, the rebellion might have spread to the rest of the system.</p><h4>UNDER THE GAZE OF THE MARTYR</h4><p>All larger communities on Zalos are built around large monastery complexes from which the Order controls the area. The monasteries often house hundreds of order members and are always heavily fortified. Every day, the residents of the surrounding areas make their way to the monasteries for religious services and flagellation in honor of the Martyr. The cities are made of stone, with prayer towers, high pointed roofs, narrow alleys, and few open spaces. The cities of Zalos are busy and labyrinthine, while large parts of the cities on Zahedan have been reduced to ruins and dust by the war.</p><p>Certain things remain constant in the lives of the system’s inhabitants. Prayer and flagellation are important on both Zalos and Zahedan. Faith defines every aspect of life, from family relations to work and warfare. Several smaller cults within the Order have fled out into space to escape the war. One such cult is the Hymns of the End Times. They have constructed the eight so-called Coral stations that are spread across the system.

No one comes here voluntarily, unless they are traveling between Coriolis and Mira, or desperate enough to seek fortune and fame in the ruined system.</p><p>The system contains three planets – Sethlen, Rusah, and Qayna – and the scattered remains of a fourth one. None of the planets have any major settlements. The system is much too difficult to navigate for it to be economically viable for any of the Consortium companies to expand here. Odacon has instead become a place for truly daring free trader captains and all sorts of underhanded business. There is no major faction presence here, and the population of the system is spread out in small colonies and independent space stations.</p><p>Odacon was colonized by the Firstcome peoples long ago, and used to be a rich system with a large population. Several planets contained big cities and advanced industries. Then came the war. While initially spared, Odacon was hit hard towards the end. The final and most devastating battles of the war took place in the system and caused destruction on a scale beyond anything the Horizon had witnessed before, making Odacon the fragmented system it is today.</p><h4>THE DANGERS OF ODACON</h4><p>That most crews choose other routes than the one through Odacon is no mystery. The dangers here are many, and physical threats like corsairs or the remains of ancient war machines are not the only ones – navigating the system is also difficult. Since the war, the star has become unstable and unpredictable. It has cooled down considerably and creates strange gravitational phenomena. Both portals in the system are unstable and require a seasoned captain to be used. Several inexperienced crews have been left stranded here, unable to read their navigation systems.</p><h4>SPACE STATION KHÔBAN</h4><p>If the system can be said to have an administrative seat at all, it would be the Khôban portal station. About five hundred souls call Khôban their home, all living in the outer layers of the station while the core modules are slowly decaying. No slummers are allowed in the decrepit parts, but this rule is difficult to enforce. General law enforcement is handled by judicators from Coriolis, but it is the Martyr warriors there to protect Inashar Delion, the Order’s consul to the station, and the Legionnaires that guard the Consortium’s interests that are the actual deterrents to would-be troublemakers.</p><h4>THE ASH BELT</h4><p>The Ash belt hangs like a dark shroud in the emptiness between the portals in Odacon. It consists of the remnants of Matush, the fourth planet that was destroyed during the wars, and the pulverized wrecks of enormous armadas. The Ash belt is a gold mine for scrapper crews and adventurers but also contains many dangers. Apart from the mythical Bane of Ashes, the belt is also home to bloodthirsty corsairs, automated battle systems and forgotten mines. Several small asteroid and space station communities nonetheless exist in the depths of the belt.</p><p>Few things can chill the blood of Odacon’s residents quite like the mention of the Bane of Ashes. It is an entity said to be able to destroy a ship by breaking it down, molecule by molecule. Some say that the Bane of Ashes is a semi-intelligent war machine while others believe it to be a chaotic cloud of nanites. The truth about the Bane has yet to be revealed.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"dKeSCLIo9On1ZFxm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266101,"modifiedTime":1680376266101,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"UO4mdA1mQ7w1hL5T"}

For a long time, this was just empty space on the edges of the Kua system, but this changed dramatically when a Foundation probe found something deep inside the Kandah cloud. An expedition traveled to the Rimward Reach and found that it hadn’t always been empty. Strange monuments and drifting shipwrecks bore witness to a time when Firstcome colonists didn’t fear the big black.</h3><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/nomadsvärm.webp\" /></div><p><strong>Today, many years</strong> later, the area is a haven for freethinkers and fortune seekers, but a bloody struggle for the area’s resources is being fought under the calm surface. This “end of the Horizon” gathers shady prospectors, cunning spies, and ruthless archaeologists, all fighting for their chance at a better life – a fight with few winners and many losers. The Rimward Reach is not dominated by any one faction, an exception in the otherwise Consortium-controlled system. Because of its remote location, the factions’ initial disinterest, and the independent space station Djachroum’s strong position, the Rimward Reach is a melting pot of groups both big and small with colliding agendas.</p><h4>THE INDEPENDENT SPACE STATION DJACHROUM</h4><p>Thanks to its strategic position in the Mouth of Kandah, Djachroum has become the most important hub in the Rimward Reach. The head of the station is the enigmatic Aqbar who has turned Djachroum into both a protector of the Rimward Reach and a uniting force for its peoples. The roughly 12,000 inhabitants of the station include every sort of misfit or adventurer the Horizon has to offer, from independent miners and smugglers to radical theologists and eccentric mystics, all drawn to the Rimward Reach to escape the yoke of factionary oppression.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CAVE OF BRIDGES</h5><p>The beating heart of the Djachroum station is the enormous cavern in the middle of the asteroid called the Cave of Bridges. Wabas visiting for the first time are met with a stupefying view. The circular cave is hundreds of meters high and wide, cluttered with Firstcome stone houses, plastic sheds, rickety ladders, winding stairs and above all, a thick net of stairs and ramps. The cave is never quiet – the sales pitches of the merchants blend with the kabbah from the Governor’s Palace and the snickering of the Kuan bantam monkeys that jump between the bridges high above the ground, searching for something shining or edible.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE TWIN STATION</h5><p>The station is split into two by a deep chasm called Eskalom’s rift. What caused the rift is unclear but analyses have determined it to be approximately three centuries old, about the same time that the Founders disappeared from the Rimward Reach. The other side of the rift houses the ruins of an old part of Djachroum today called the Twin Station. The restless ghosts of the Founders are supposedly still haunting the halls of the Twin Station. Both Eskalom’s rift and the Twin Station are off-limits on the orders of Akbar. Djachroum’s inhabitants love a good ghost story about the halls on the other side, but are mindful not to come near the rift. The only ones with any kind of knowledge about the forgotten parts of the station are the mysterious and reclusive operators, the station’s engineer clan, running the ancient life support systems from their homes in the Machine halls. The Machine halls are also off-limits and very few have actually seen an operator.</p><h4>THE LEGACY OF THE FOUNDERS</h4><p>The Firstcome people that once lived in the Rimward Reach and constructed the Djachroum station are known today only as the Founders. Who they were or where they came from is unknown, but scientists of more or less honest repute have a plethora of theories. Studies of ruins and archaeological findings have shown that the Founders were deeply religious y were also accomplished scientists and researchers; the many advanced machines they left behind are clear proof of this. Many Founder artifacts can be found throughout the Rimward Reach.</p><h4>THE MARRAB CONFLICT</h4><p>All of the Rimward Reach today is somehow affected by the low intensity conflict between the prospector clans and the nomad swarms. The heart of the conflict is a dispute over who has the rights to the valuable maghdan deposits that exist in the Marrab cluster. When the clans started looking for maghdan around Kandah, they founded bases on several asteroids around the cloud. All was well until one day when they discovered huge deposits of maghdan around the Marrab asteroid, traditionally considered a holy site and used as a meeting place and settlement by the nomad swarms. The nomads would allow no mining to take place and when the hot-blooded prospectors attempted to do it anyway, their ships and drones were shot down, and this is how the violent Marrab conflict started. Recently it has escalated, the confrontations becoming bloodier and bloodier.</p><h4>KUAN EXPANSION</h4><p>The last few cycles of Kuan expansion into the Rimward Reach, especially by the Consortium and the Legion, have caused tensions, but so far, violent confrontation has been avoided. In just the last few segments, the Legion has increased their presence in the Rimward Reach heavily. It started when they formed a blockade around the Armada of the Firstcome, something that surprised even their allies in the Foundation. Stubborn rumors claim that a bulk hauler under heavy escort is about to arrive at the Thalus base. The seers and info mongers of Coriolis are all in agreement that something is about to happen in The Reach.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE ARMADA OF THE FIRSTCOME</h5><p>One of the greatest mysteries left behind by the Founders is the cluster of ship wrecks called the Armada of the Firstcome – hundreds of wrecks in eerily perfect rows. Some of them seem to have deactivated but operational systems. Investigators are puzzled by the incomprehensible encryption that protects the Armada’s slumbering systems – it would almost seem as if the old ships are waiting for their old masters to return. The Legion set up a blockade around the Armada a little while back. Maybe they have succeeded where the ship archaeologists failed?</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Q1T43m02iEmzwLJs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266805,"modifiedTime":1680376266805,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"UfKR70kL7FyayCyh"}

The PCs leave the Sultra and return to other adventures in the Horizon. As the GM, you are free to let your players explore other planets and systems. Some of the questions they may have will not be answered until the second installation of the Mercy of the Icons campaign, but until then, the search for the other Emissaries may be used to create thrilling adventures. The political consequences of the events in the scenarios above may also be used as a backdrop for further play.</p><h4>THE FIVE EMISSARIES</h4><p>Five Emissaries emerged from the depths of Xene. The minds of five Symmetry mystics traveled through the mystic node at Xene and possessed a group of explorers working on a Foundation probe researching the gas giant. Since then, the Emissaries have scattered across the Horizon to find out more about the plans of the First Horizon. They have all chosen to present themselves as an incarnation of one of the nine Icons, but only the Emissaries known as the Messenger and the Judge have received large-scale public attention. The coming scenarios in the Mercy of the Icons campaign will feature more Symmetry mystics, so for your own scenarios in the meantime, you should only use the Emissaries found in the tables below. The circumstances regarding the two best known Emissaries are somewhat special:</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Messenger</h5><p>The Messenger Emissary has lost its host body and only remains as an echo in the void around Coriolis and Kua. If your group wishes to explore the story of this particular Emissary, there are two paths to investigate. The first one revolves around the mystics drawn to Coriolis by the echo, and around the Children of the Song, a cult of mystics growing stronger on the station. They are under the protection of the Circle of Seekers and can be used as a focal point for political drama on the station, or as possible employers in the search for the remaining Emissaries. The second path will take the PCs to Mira to investigate the origins of the Messenger’s host body, the explorer Alam Dania. This could reveal more information about the group of prospectors who went down to Xene as humans, and returned as something else.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Judge</h5><p>The Emissary known as the Judge residing on the Foundation’s Xene station is featured in one of the mission suggestions below but will also play an important part in coming scenarios in the campaign. If the PCs travel to Xene, they will therefore find that the Judge has been evacuated from the station. Keep the focus on the political consequences this might lead to, and on the stories shared by those who have met the Judge. As the GM, think carefully before using the actual Judge Emissary in your game.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"G363jD3ICFn6YVey","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296171,"modifiedTime":1682695296171,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"wiZzuCkRrtYJsPS0","sort":0,"_id":"WjiUznUNwrAbSdSA"}

You are the PCs' friends and enemies. You are the meteorite that soars through space and the storm that howls through the jungle. You are the beings in the shadows, the mystical artifacts the PCs find, and much, much more. It is a tough and demanding job to animate the world of Coriolis, but also both a fun and creative job. There are a few elements in Coriolis that make it a unique game. These are briefly presented below.</p><h4>THE PRINCIPLES OF THE GAME</h4><p>The principles of the game are aids for you as GM to create the right setting and mood. They can also help you handle situations that arise during the course of the game. Learn them by heart and use them in the game.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CULTURE IS EVERYTHING</h5><p>The world of Coriolis is full of different cultures that influence the Horizon, from the proud Firstcome cultures that celebrate mysticism, religion and tradition to the modern pioneers that arrived with the Zenith. Infuse the game world with inspiration from the Middle East and the mysterious fairytale ambiance of the Arabian Nights.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MISSIONS FUEL THE STORY</h5><p>To survive in the Horizon, the PCs must go on missions to earn birr, status or spaceship parts. Let the group’s focus and goals drive the game. Give them missions that mean something, that change them and that maybe even change the whole Horizon in the end.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THEIR SPACESHIP IS THEIR HEART</h5><p>The group’s spaceship will be their home, their means of transportation and their most important asset. Let the spaceship become an extra character in the group, with its own life, quirks and history. The spaceship is the group’s most essential possession – use it to create story arcs and challenges.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FACTIONS RULE THE HORIZON</h5><p>The mighty factions dominate most of the Horizon and are constantly competing with each other, always trying to extend their influence at the expense of someone else’s. Whether they want to or not, the PCs will sooner or later be sucked into the scheming and plotting – either as willing participants or manipulated pawns.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SPACE IS FULL OF MYSTERIES</h5><p>The game world of Coriolis is full of unsolved mysteries, ancient secrets and strange riddles. Let the PCs explore the secrets of the Third Horizon during their travels. Let them find Portal Builder ruins, hear rumors about the fearsome powers of the Emissaries, and discover strange remains of Firstcome civilizations long lost in the sands of time.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SUPERNATURAL IS REAL</h5><p>To the people of the Third Horizon, the supernatural is real – djinn, the darkbound, and unexplainable phenomena really exist. Where it all comes from is not so clear, however. Icon believers say that it comes from the Dark between the Stars, while others blame technology from ancient civilizations. Use the supernatural effectively but not too often; let it be something special and frightening. Those who don’t worship the Icons in the Third Horizon will stick out. Make sure that this is obvious to the players; have NPCs around them pray, receive blessings and make the sign against the Dark between the Stars. Use your Darkness Points for dramatic effect to add suspense to the game.</p><h4>SCENES – BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS</h4><p>A handy GM tool is to handle the story as a series of scenes. This could help you make your storytelling more effective. The players could also take the lead and initiate scenes in the game. So, what is a scene? A scene is the part of the game where the important things happen, where the PCs interact with NPCs and the game world. A scene will usually be between a few minutes and half an hour of game time. Instead of playing what happens every single minute of a day or during long voyages, concentrate on the important events. Scenes should always have a purpose, such as:</p><ul><li>to drive the story forward</li><li>to show conflict</li><li>to introduce or explore an NPC</li><li>to create suspense or atmosphere</li><li>to give the players some important piece of information</li><li>to expand on one of the principles of the game</li></ul><p>When creating a scene, it is important to think about defining where it start and end. If a scene starts too early it can become boring before you get to the good part, and the same goes for not ending the scene after the important events are over. Create scenes about individual events or encounters, not about places.</p><h4>TIME IN THE GAME</h4><p>Time in the game is measured in two ways – game time and story time. Game time is the different time divisions relevant to the session and to the real world.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GAME TIME</h5><ul><li><strong>Turn</strong>: A turn is the time it takes for all the PCs to act and defend themselves in a conflict. A turn is usually 10-20 seconds measured in story time.</li><li><strong>Scene</strong>: The time it takes to resolve a conflict or end an event for some other reason. Usually from a minute or two to half an hour.</li><li><strong>Session</strong>: The time you set aside to play the game at a given time, usually two to four hours. At the end of each session, the PCs are awarded XP.</li><li><strong>Scenario</strong>: An adventure spanning several sessions, ending or resolving a major problem.</li><li><strong>Campaign</strong>: Two to four scenarios that together form a story arc. When a campaign ends, it should leave a noticeable mark on the Third Horizon.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STORY TIME</h5><p>The time that passes in the game world is called story time. This is usually not something you need to keep track of, but sometimes it could be worth mentioning that it took the group an hour to get from the Neoptra spaceport to the Net, or that a conflict that took fifteen minutes of game time was actually just a minute or two of story time. You can use story time in the game to make something more dramatic:</p><ul><li><strong>Against the clock</strong>: Putting the PCs under time pressure can add to the suspense. This could involve traps that close in a few minutes time or a bomb that will explode in half an hour. You can, for example, count all skill tests during a certain part of the scenario to determine how much time has passed, and maybe guide their choice of skills.</li><li><strong>Story time and levels of success or failure</strong>: Let something take more or less time to complete depending on how well the PCs did on their skill tests. This can be combined with time pressure for extra drama. As a general rule, a critical success should cut the time it takes to do something in half, and even more sixes can shorten the time further.</li><li><strong>The length of an action</strong>: You can let a single action (one skill test) take up a lot of story time to zoom out of the story if it suits the situation. For example, one manipulation roll could be several months of negotiations during a summit or conference between factions or corporations, and one observation test can be a thirty-hour stake-out of a Martyr commando or a Syndicate warehouse. This can be a way of making longer cuts in a scenario without getting stuck in the details.</li><li><strong>Zooming in and out</strong>: The time it takes to perform a certain action can vary. Use this to change the tempo of the story, to introduce an unexpected event or to start a new scene.</li></ul><h4>SCENARIOS IN CORIOLIS</h4><p>Coriolis is a game designed for epic campaigns where you see the Horizon change by your actions, but you can of course also play smaller, more focused campaigns, concentrating on the concept or goal of the group. Maybe it all takes place on a cut-off colony on a remote moon or in a surrounded squad of drone operators on Uharu-13. Regardless of how you intend to play, there are many different ways to create a good story in Coriolis. Below are the three main formats of the game:</p><ul><li>Mini scenarios describe one event, with a background, starting point, a few short episodes, and some suggestions for epilogues and continuation. These are suitable for one or two sessions. Example: The Statuette of Zhar Baghra on page 347 @JournalEntry[The Statuette of Zha].</li><li>Scenario locations describe a place – its current situation and the NPCs, technology and artifacts it contains. Short suggestions for events are included, but the sector is otherwise open and not tied to a specific story. Example: Terenganu Valley on page 351 @JournalEntry[Terenganu Valley] and Wahib’s cantina on page 357 @JournalEntry[Wahib's Cantina].</li><li>Full-length adventures are stories in three acts, with a few possible starting points and key scenes, locations and NPCs as well as suggestions for the aftermath. Only full-length adventures contain fully described scenes.</li></ul><h4>HOW TO MANAGE DIFFICULTY LEVELS</h4><p>When the dice come out, it is good to know how to determine a relevant difficulty level. The Skills chapter describes the difficulty levels and the levels of success. It is important to remember that the difficulty of something should reflect the drama of the situation and not necessarily the ”realism” of it – it should be harder to perform something dramatically important than something less so. It is better to use the higher levels of difficulty for important rolls rather than to have the same difficulty all the time, and instead give the players negative modifiers when things heat up. This will have the psychological effect of making the players feel challenged rather than limited or discouraged. The last important piece of advice about difficulty levels is that you as the GM should always be able to justify the difficulty. It should not be relatively difficult for the PC depending on her skill level; there has to be a logic to the roll that fits with the story.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LOW DIFFICULTY</h5><p>There are several reasons for low difficulty levels, such as to let the PCs excel at something. Things that are in the way of the drama should have low difficulty levels so as not to slow the story down.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HIGH DIFFICULTY</h5><p>High difficulty levels should be used if the players have generated a large DP pool, if they are at the end of an adventure or if their enemies are well prepared – in situations such as these, you can raise the difficulty for all actions.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>WHEN TO ROLL DICE</h5><p>Only roll dice when the outcome of the roll brings something interesting to the story, regardless of whether the roll fails or succeeds. This is quite obvious with tests that succeed – they drive the story forward – but try to make sure all failures become interesting and not just roadblocks in the story. They must lead the way to something new and exciting. If a failed roll has no interesting effects, you might as well not roll the dice at all.</p></div><h4>NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS</h4><p>As the GM, you command ion storms, artifact creatures and djinn, but your non-player characters are your most important tools. When you want to create tension or drama in the game, an effective way could be to use the NPCs the PCs hate, want to protect, or have some other relationship with.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>LET THEM LIVE</h4><p>If you can, try to keep your NPCs from dying too soon. An NPC who survives to return later is more fun than a dead one. You should also avoid letting the PCs get to an important enemy too easily. Put some henchmen in their way first, and if the PCs still manages to kill the enemy or some other important NPC – let them deal with the consequences!</p></div><h4>CREATING NPCS</h4><p>Start by deciding which sub-concept your NPC should have. An NPC could have a concept as well, but doesn’t have to.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 15.1 TYPICAL NPCS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>NPC</th><th>STRENGTH</th><th>AGILITY</th><th>WITS</th><th>EMPATHY</th><th>REPUTATION</th><th>SKILLS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Agent</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>Manipulation 3, Observation 2, Ranged Combat 1</td></tr><tr><td>Data Spider</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>Data Djinn 3, Manipulation 2, Culture 1</td></tr><tr><td>Negotiator</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>Manipulation 3, Culture 2, Command 1</td></tr><tr><td>Fugitive</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>Mystic Powers 3, Infiltration 2, Melee Combat 1</td></tr><tr><td>Scientist</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>Science 3, Technology 2, Observation 1</td></tr><tr><td>Ship Worker</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>Force 3, Dexterity 2, Melee Combat 1</td></tr><tr><td>Artist</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>Manipulation 3, Dexterity 2, Culture 1</td></tr><tr><td>Soldier</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>Ranged combat 3, Melee Combat 2, Command 1</td></tr><tr><td>Pilot</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>Pilot 3, Data Djinn 2, Technology 1</td></tr><tr><td>Preacher</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Manipulation 3, Culture 2, Survival 1</td></tr><tr><td>Trailblazer</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>Survival 3, Observation 2, Dexterity 1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Attributes</strong>: Table 15.1 lists typical attribute scores for NPCs. If the NPC doesn’t have a concept, you could just give her a 3 in all the attributes. The listed scores are just examples – you can create NPCs with higher or lower scores if you want to, even higher than the PCs get to start with, but don’t give an NPC higher than a 5 in an attribute.</p><p><strong>Reputation</strong>: Table 15.1 lists Reputation scores. You can use the table for inspiration. The scores are set for stationary NPCs – if your NPC is a plebeian, lower the score by 2, and if she is privileged, raise it by 2.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Typical skill levels for the different concepts are listed in table 15.1. You can change the scores if you want to. An NPC with a specific concept must have a level of at least 1 in all her concept skills.</p><p><strong>Talents</strong>: NPCs are usually without talents, but you can give a talent to an especially capable NPC if you wish.</p><p><strong>Name, characteristics and goal</strong>: Apart from the stats and scores, there are three things you need to know about every NPC:</p><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>. What is her name?</li><li><strong>Characteristics</strong>. How does she look, how does she act, does she have any distinguishing quirks?</li><li><strong>Goal</strong>. What are her goals?</li></ul><p>Future scenarios and products will include lists of many different NPCs.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch15/hassasin_frakrykte.webp\" /></div><h4>MANAGING NPCS</h4><p>NPCs use the same rules as PCs. They roll dice to accomplish difficult tasks, they need medical care if they become broken and they risk permanent injuries if they are critically injured. You can however disregard the rules aspects of your NPCs as long as it won’t directly affect a PC. Don’t keep track of resources or gear for the NPCs – that way, you retain the freedom to decide when they run out of something. Don’t roll dice for the actions of NPCs unless they attack or interact with a PC.</p><p><strong>Groups of NPCs</strong>: When dealing with multiple NPCs, you can have them perform actions as a group instead of individually.</p><h4>REWARDS AND EXPERIENCE</h4><p>The PCs and the Third Horizon are constantly changing. There are several ways the PCs can evolve and it is the GM’s job to make sure the game offers the players drives and rewards. Suitable rewards could be:</p><ul><li>Talents</li><li>Cybernetics and bionics</li><li>Artifacts</li><li>Gear</li><li>Spaceship improvements</li></ul><p>When it comes to talents (both group and regular ones), these can also be purchased using XP. The same goes for cybernetics and bionics, but patrons and employers could also provide the group with these, as well as with gear, modules or features. Artifacts are something the PCs must find themselves during their adventures, however. Future products will include suggested rewards.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"0sAiTt81JsK9Gq8H","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376267015,"modifiedTime":1680376267015,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"bArkpH8OiKEDtwIk","sort":0,"_id":"Wk7xQGbzXgTbYXiG"}

Dans certains endroits, elles sont même révérées sous des noms différents mais, selon l’Église, ce sont bien les mêmes Icônes.</p><h1>L'église des icônes</h1><p>L’ascension de l’Église des Icônes a fait évoluer la manière dont les Icônes sont vénérées dans l’Horizon.</p><p>La canonisation des saintes écritures et la Déclaration des Rites sacrés ont formalisé l’exercice de la foi comme jamais auparavant. Les aspects sombres des Icônes ont été officiellement bannis, même s’ils perdurent dans la plupart des esprits.</p><p>Les matriarches et les patriarches gouvernent l’Église depuis Mira, Coriolis et Dabaran. Ils sont tous unis par un lien de vie mais n’ont pas d’enfant car leur dévotion va exclusivement aux Icônes. Les rites sacrés sont les pinacles de la foi, et ils sont tous d’une importance égale pour les croyants, bien que les coutumes locales puissent les influencer en fonction du système, de la culture et du clan.</p><h1>Les rites sacrés</h1><h2>La mission</h2><p>La mission est ce qui sépare la nouvelle foi des anciennes coutumes que l’on retrouve sur Mira, Zalos et Sadaal. Pour accomplir le rite de la mission, un croyant doit quitter son foyer et parcourir l’Horizon pendant un segment, pour répandre la bonne parole. Des prédicateurs ou des prophètes de bas rang sont souvent envoyés servir dans une chapelle ou un monastère aux confins de la civilisation, parfois pendant une triade entière.</p><h2>Le lien de vie</h2><p>Tôt ou tard vient le moment où chacun doit nouer un lien de vie. Pour les fidèles orthodoxes, le but de ces unions était de procréer, mais cela est possible indépendamment du sexe dans le Troisième Horizon, grâce aux technologies avancées telles que les nutri-utérus et le clonage. Le divorce est interdit. Les veuves et veufs sont supposés porter le deuil de leur défunt conjoint pendant le reste de leur vie.</p><h2>Le credo</h2><p>Une fois par an, pendant la Cyclade, les fidèles doivent déclarer ouvertement leur foi en récitant le credo dans un temple en compagnie d’autres dévots.</p><h2>La bénédiction</h2><p>Tout croyant peut bénir sa maison, son bateau, son magasin ou tout autre commerce. Les bénédictions sont particulièrement importantes avant de partir en voyage, au début d’une nouvelle année ou d’un nouveau cycle.</p><h2>Le jeûne</h2><p>Au cours du segment du Négociant, entre l’aube et le crépuscule (pendant les gardes du matin et du jour) les fidèles doivent s’abstenir de se nourrir et de boire. Les enfants et les malades en sont dispensés. Le but du jeûne est de purifier le corps et l’âme, mais également de rappeler l’importance de la nécessité matérielle.</p><h2>La confession</h2><p>Les fidèles doivent, afin de purifier leur esprit, confesser leurs péchés une fois par segment, de préférence à un prêtre, ou à une prêtresse, consacré. Un missionnaire, un prédicateur ou un pèlerin peuvent cependant parfaitement faire l’affaire. Aucun croyant n’est à l’abri des erreurs et des mensonges, ce qui fait de la confession un sacrement d’une grande importance.</p><h2>Le pèlerinage</h2><p>Les fidèles doivent visiter deux lieux saints au moins une fois au cours de leur vie : le Dôme des Icônes sur Coriolis et Iconopolis sur Mira. Beaucoup considèrent la cité-temple de Lotus sur Dabaran comme un site encore plus sacré, et l’Église subit dernièrement d’énormes pressions pour inclure Lotus dans le pèlerinage.</p><h2>Le don d'aumônes</h2><p>Faire l’aumône aux pauvres contente les Icônes et doit être fait une fois par segment. Les fidèles doivent faire don d’un neuvième de leurs revenus. L’aumône est considérée comme l’un des rites sacrés les plus importants sur Mira.</p><h2>La prière</h2><p>Les fidèles doivent prier deux fois par jour, à l’aube et au crépuscule. Des exceptions à cette règle sont acceptées si la vie du croyant est en danger ou en cas exceptionnels. Aux quatre coins de l’Horizon, les gens ont l’habitude de se rassembler pour prier sur des places dédiées, à genoux et, de préférence, sur un tapis de prière.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Le Messager","type":"text","_id":"8lb1v8sMa9KCH6QH","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Le Messager aux pieds légers apporte nouvelles, prières et présages où que se trouvent les fidèles.</p><p> Le Messager est dépeint comme un garçon pâle aux visage sévère et aux yeux flamboyants.

You, the player, decide what your PC does, thinks, and says – but not what challenges she needs to overcome. Your job as a player is to bring your PC to life.

Your decisions, your lives.</p><h4>Gamemaster</h4><p>The last player takes on the role of the Gamemaster (GM). He describes the world around you, he plays the other characters you encounter during your adventures, he controls the monsters and enemies standing in your way, and he decides what truths that lie behind the secrets you uncover.</p><p>It’s the GM’s job to put obstacles in your way, to challenge your PCs and to force them to show what they’re truly made of. It’s not his job, however, to decide everything that happens in the game – and certainly not how your story should end.

The banquet infiltration has diverted their attention from the Order assassin however, who now makes a return in style – prince Leod suddenly collapses on the cold marble floor!</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PANIC</h5><p>This is the last scene in Act II and it begins with Leod collapsing on the floor. In the ensuing turmoil, bodyguards belonging to different factions of party-goers will open fire on one another and then escort their respective dignitaries out of the way, trampling unlucky waiters and staff who get in their way.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>After the PCs’ meeting with Leod or Jarja, someone poisons the prince, and as he collapses, panic breaks out among the guests.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs should know about the Sultra marshes by now. If they are accompanied by Jarja, she can fill in the blanks afterwards if they still lack some of the information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LEOD’S CONFESSION</h5><p>If the PCs make their way through the chaos to Leod and try to help him, he will whisper all he knows of the operation to them:</p><ul><li>Salamah ach-Abaud is actually not the mastermind behind the operation. The people in the Sultra are clearly the end customers, but someone else is behind the planning of it all.</li><li>Leod’s informants in the Monolith have revealed to him that the Zenithian Hegemony – more specifically some of the hegemonist ministers in the Cabinet – are manipulating the operation for some unknown reason.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LEOD’S LAST WORDS</h5><p>The following information is only revealed to the PCs if they really put their backs into keeping Leod alive, thus shielding him from Akouba Kosha’s attempts to kill him (see the The Dying Dandy event below).</p><ul><li>Leod has come to the conclusion that the hegemonists wish to destabilize Coriolis to wrestle control over the station from the Consortium.</li><li>He has been approached by the Hegemony’s secret police, the Astûrban. They wanted to make sure he took Salamah’s offer by promising to get his son married to Theda Din Hrama.</li><li>His informants tell him that the Astûrban have agents inside Salamah’s group, both on Coriolis and on Kua – “…don’t trust anyone!”</li></ul><h4>THE PALACE</h4><p>The scene begins with Leod’s collapse in the banquet hall. From there, the guests and their bodyguards can either move toward the plaza outside the palace by crossing the atrium, or they can hide in the staff areas, or even in the basement. Consult the descriptions of the palace in Criminal Royalty above for more details (page 140 @JournalEntry[02 - Criminal Royalty]).</p>@JournalEntry[Banquet Hall Scene]<h4>NPCS</h4><p>You can use many of the NPCs already described above. The scene mainly involves the bodyguards, (page 141 @Actor[Household Guards and Mercenaries]) who try to escort their clients to safety; @Actor[Jarja Dougha], (page 142) who tries to flee the palace; @Actor[Akouba Kosha 2] (page 143) and @Actor[Ataia] the assassin (page 132), the latter two having unfinished business in the palace.</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>During the scene, the PCs must try to exit the palace as it rapidly descends into chaos. It is important that the PCs witness Leod’s death and that the ensuing chaos makes their escape both dangerous and dramatic, but they should eventually make it out and head for the docks to continue their journey to the Sultra marshes.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/Den_Förgiftade_Fursten_07.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DYING DANDY</h5><p>Over the course of the evening, the final marriage negotiations between the Din Hramas and the dol-Qaussars have taken place. Read out the text below or use it as inspiration:</p><p><em>Leod gets up and walks over to the steps leading down from the head tables. He looks out across the room and raises his hands toward the Din Hramas in a welcoming gesture.</em><br /><em>“Honored guests, an accord has been signed. Dabaran and Zenith shall become one.</em><br /><em>Ours will be a line courtesans will sing of for centuries to come.</em><br /><em>This is the beginning of something new – a beautiful, more harmonious Horizon.</em><br /><em>Witness, friends, the miracle we call unity.”</em></p><p>Just before Leod collapses, an alert PC who passes an observation test spots the soothsayer they saw outside the Hassam offices earlier in the scenario. She is dressed as a household servant, standing in the shadows at the far end of the hall. The PC also see that she is the one who shoots at the bodyguards with a silenced acc pistol after Leod’s collapse (see below) and then disappears into the crowd.</p><p><em>As Aedon Din Hrama rises with clenched jaws and a sullen face to acknowledge the legality of the contract, Leod suddenly slumps forward in a convulsive spasm. Bloody saliva sprays across the floor as he gasps for air, and he stumbles toward his bodyguards but falls to the floor. He hits his head hard on the steps, and a pool of blood quickly begins spread across the white marble.</em></p><p><em>The nobleman’s house guards lunge toward the stairs as the rest of the guests let out a collective scream and the wealthier party-goers’ bodyguards get in formation around their clients. As Leod’s guards near their master, they also suddenly fall to the ground, turning the elevated platform by the head tables into a massacre as blood splatters across the white linen. Akouba Kosha gets into cover behind a nearby column and shouts at you to do the same as the bulk of the crowd start to flee toward the nearest exit. Leod lies alone and bleeding on the steps, stretching a trembling hand out toward you.</em></p><p>If the PCs move toward Leod, you can spend 1 DP to have three guards approach them, guns drawn, shouting at them to get away from him and throw down their weapons. The group must either buy one PC enough time to speak to the dying prince by stalling the guards, or prepare to fight them.</p><ul><li><strong>At Death’s Door</strong>: If a PC gets to Leod in time and manages to stabilize his wounds, he will reveal more details about the operation (see Important Facts above). He is at 0 HP and has suffered a critical injury equivalent of Severed carotid artery (see page 97 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]), but he remains conscious.</li><li><strong>Akouba</strong>: Akouba really doesn’t want Leod to say another word to the PCs, and if they approach the dying prince, she will as well. She offers to carry him toward an exit if the PCs protect her. After a hectic escape to the atrium, they find that Leod has passed. Unbeknownst to the PCs, Akouba hastened his demise during the run. If a clever PC somehow catches onto this and confronts her with it, she will deny it and, if all else fails, turn on the PCs. She would prefer not to blow her cover however, as she wishes to remain close with the group to steer their suspicions toward the Order.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0–1 DP (Mandatory)</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><p>THE ICON’S REFLECTION<br />The butterfly’s wings shadow the Horizon.<br />The pain of birth awaits us<br />between moments lived and moments lost.<br />The mirror defines the distance<br />between reflected and reflection.</p><p>– Nabi-mu-Qad, the Messenger Emissary</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE GUNSMITH’S PLEA</h5><p>As the PCs are about to exit the banquet hall, Jarja comes rushing up to them. She thinks she might be next on the assassin’s hit list and asks them to help her escape. She is desperate and will do anything to leave the palace alive – even show them the way through the Sultra. There are river barges ready and waiting in the basement that could get them out of the city. Unless the PCs already investigated her gun locker, she gives them the weapons and the file it contains.<br />At the cost of 1 DP, you can have Ataia fire a silenced shot at Jarja before disappearing into the staff corridors.</p><ul><li><strong>Jarja’s last words</strong>: If Jarja doesn’t manage to escape the palace, you should have her reveal the abductees’ end destination before she dies – the Sul-Mahala palace, located right underneath Cataract 27. She wishes to make up for the crimes she has committed by sending so many people to their deaths in the marshes, or to a life in chains in the Monolith.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0–1 DP (Mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  COLLATERAL DAMAGE</h5><p>When the majority of the guests have made their way to the atrium, a bomb hidden near the front door explodes. The assassin has booby-trapped the main door as a back-up plan.</p><ul><li><strong>Explosion</strong>: The charge is a quadruple satchel charge (blast effect 4, weapon damage 1, CRIT 1) and the GM decides who is close enough to the explosion to get hit. Armor may be tested normally, and the main door or one of the columns nearby count as cover 4 and 5, respectively.</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FRIEND OR FOE</h5><p>A group of between three and five guards – either household guards or some party guest’s personal security forces – get in the PCs’ way. The guards feel threatened and shout at the PCs to drop their weapons (if they have any). Unless they obey, combat is imminent. The same situation might also arise if the PCs get too close to, or in the way of, a dignitary being escorted out of the palace.</p><ul><li><strong>Threat Level</strong>: At the cost of 1 DP, the guards are threatening but cautious, and a fight can be avoided by successfully testing command, or manipulation at –1. At the cost of 2 DP, the guard immediately open fire.</li></ul><p>This event can be used multiple time during the PCs’ escape from the palace.</p><p>Cost: 1–2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESONANCE – INTRUDERS</h5><p>A mystic PC might pick up traces of resonance left behind by the Emissary.</p><ul><li>During an especially stressful situation, such as the escape from the palace, the PC suddenly feels a sharp pain in her chest. Her skin crawls, her eyes tear up, and everything goes dark.</li><li>At the cost of 1 DP, the PC must test mystic powers to remain in control of herself. Failure means that the intense pain and discomfort becomes so bad that she gets a –2 to all actions where she must rely on sight or touch for D6 minutes.</li><li>Searing, stabbing pain overwhelms the PC and she hears voices chanting in Zalosi. A successful culture test is required to interpret the chant:<br />“We carry your crown within us. Your suffering – our actions. Our hands – your blades. In the name of the Martyr, we separate darkness from light…”</li><li>The affected PC can also hear a monotonous song, a shielding prayer. The song sweeps the pain away and the PC feels a divine calm surround her (see the boxed text below). The stabbing feeling ceases, the pain disappears, and the song becomes a single note.</li></ul><p>What the PC is experiencing is the Emissary being tortured. In the martyr strike team’s secret base in the Sultra, the warriors are trying to interrogate the Emissary, but the wounds from the torture heal as fast as they are inflicted.</p><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE KILLER STRIKES</h5><p>When Jarja and the PCs have exited the palace and are making their way across the plaza or along the river, the assassin strikes again. Her goal is to take out Jarja and then escape, but she is very stressed and her shot might hit someone else instead. As the GM, you could for example roll a die to determine who is hit – 1–3 means Jarja, and 4–6 means a randomly chosen PCs. Ataia will strike from an elevated position and from behind cover, and will try to funnel the PCs toward groups of guards in the area to possibly escalate the violence. At the cost of 2 DP, you can play the Friend or Foe event above during this event to aid Ataia in her attempts to take out Jarja.</p><ul><li><strong>Death Before Dishonor</strong>: The assassin will do whatever it takes to kill Jarja, and if she succeeds, she will disappear into the night. If the PCs get the upper hand and manage to wound or capture her however, she would rather take her own life than allow herself to be interrogated.</li><li><strong>Mission Accomplished</strong>: See the The Gunsmith’s Plea event above.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0, 2 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"uJXhGVJWuH7wWEdW","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297072,"modifiedTime":1682695297072,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"CzUEdkaKoI0pi4si","sort":0,"_id":"YWTdgvr63huHI4bd"}

It is up to you to explore the game world and unearth its secrets. There are several things you will be doing while playing the game:</p><h5>Crew a space craft</h5><p>Your spaceship is your vessel, your base and your home. It is without doubt your most valuable possession and most important asset. Onboard your craft, you will experience both perilous journeys and violent conflicts that will test your mettle.</p><h5>Explore the Horizon</h5><p>The Third Horizon is the game world of Coriolis, a gigantic cluster of stars linked together by mystical portals. Together, you will explore the stars and behold their grandeur.</p><h5>Unravel secrets</h5><p>The world of Coriolis is full of mysteries and secrets. Who built the portals? From where did the strange Emissaries arrive? And what did really happen to the lost faction the Sacrifice of Nazareem? During your adventures, you will delve into the mysterious world that is the Third Horizon – and perhaps learn something about yourselves along the way.</p><h5>Plot &amp; Scheme onboard Coriolis</h5><p>The factions of the Third Horizon are wrapped up in a never-ending struggle for power and influence – a game that you sooner or later will be forced to engage in. The agents of the factions converge on the Coriolis space station, and this is where the lies and the scheming are most intense.</p><h5>Carry out missions</h5><p>In order to survive and build yourselves a better future, you will have to take on missions. Whether it is hauling Dabaran wine to a colony out on the fringes of civilization, spying on a rival faction or acting as bodyguards to a wealthy merchant, you will have to work together to accomplish the mission in the best way you can.</p><h5>Pray to the Icons</h5><p>Icon worship is ever-present in the Third Horizon. Through faith, the people find strength, and so will you. When darkness surrounds you and all hope seems lost, a desperate prayer to the Icons can be what saves your lives.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"mlrs9hnRx4c7G1VR","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266999,"modifiedTime":1680592687069,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hLmLEmsMKNBiOsUN","sort":0,"_id":"Yuds43HNGXCKezpx"}

This is sometimes good to keep the story from losing focus.</p><p>While traveling in Coriolis will often be adventurous and challenging, it is also a time when the PCs can rest and recover. The rules divide traveling into three parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Development</strong> – the players get to do develop of their character in some way.</li><li><strong>Misfortunes</strong> – something bad that happens to one or more travelers.</li><li><strong>Encounters</strong> – something that affects the whole group.</li></ul><p>A good rule is that all PCs get to develop (if they have somewhere to rest and the time to spare), one PC faces a misfortune and the group as a whole gets to play a number of encounters depending on the area they are traveling through.</p><h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4><p>All PCs who travel and have time by themselves during the voyage can choose to do one of the following actions:</p><ul><li>Preparatory prayer to the Icons</li><li>Repair gear</li><li>Use XP</li><li>Change relationship to another PC</li></ul><p>Note that character development requires that the PC have time and space to herself. An arduous march through the jungles during a monsoon does not give the PCs time for character development. The GM decides when the situation allows for development.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PREPARATORY PRAYER</h5><p>A PC can make preparatory prayers and sacrifices to an Icon. This gives her +1 to all prayer rerolls (+2 if done in a chapel) during the session when praying to that same Icon again.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> REPAIR GEAR</h5><p>A PC can repair an item or a system onboard the ship/vehicle. Roll a normal <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">technology</strong> test to determine success.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> USE XP</h5><p>A PC can use her time to train and learn, trading in her pooled XP for skills or talents (page 28 in the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[The Player Character]).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CHANGE RELATIONSHIP TO ANOTHER PC</h5><p>By taking the initiative and playing out a scene, a PC can change her relationship with another person in the group. It could be an argument over neglected service to a system onboard driving two friends apart, or a scene where two PCs become closer because of shared feelings or experiences. At the end of the scene, the players agree on their new relationship and write it down on their character sheets.</p><h4>MISFORTUNES</h4><p>In Coriolis, no trip is without complications. Gear gets worn out, vital systems malfunction and accidents occur. On every journey, one PC is randomly selected to suffer some sort of misfortune. Play the misfortune as a short scene. The chosen PC should be the focus, but the rest of the group can play supporting roles. Battling a misfortune should be the chosen PC’s time in the spotlight, a chance for her to prove that she is an invaluable member of the crew. It is also a good way to show that everyone has an important part to play, regardless of whether you are the pilot or just the deckhand. On longer voyages, two or more PCs could have to face misfortunes. It is you as the GM who decides how often a misfortune should befall the group. For simplicity’s sake, a misfortune generally affects one crew position – use table 44 to determine who is affected, and then choose a misfortune from the list below, or use your imagination to create your own. The important thing is that the PC (or the group) must test skills to beat the challenge.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 44 Who Is Affected By The Misfortune</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 44 Who Is Affected By The Misfortune]</p><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>POSITION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Captain</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sensor Operator</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Gunner</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Engineer</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Pilot</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Entire group</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 45 Misfortunes On Land</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 45 Misfortunes On Land]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>MISFORTUNE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>Spoiled provisions</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Contagion</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Bad weather</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Wild animals</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Poor camp</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Lost</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Insects/vermin</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Sinkhole/Landslide</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Chased</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Storm</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Cold/Heat</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"blueheader\">THE CAPTAIN'S MISFORTUNES</div><ul><li><strong>STOWAWAYS</strong> – An uninvited guest has snuck onboard and pleads with the captain’s conscience.

Unless the PCs find cover, use the rules for Cold (page 99 in the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</li></ul><h4>ENCOUNTERS IN SPACE</h4><p>Regardless of whether the group is travelling through the emptiness of space or on the surface of a planet, they will sooner or later encounter other travelers. The frequency and nature of the encounters will vary depending on the area they are traveling through. Far from the light of civilization, the chances of crossing paths with someone are slim, but the risks that the people you do encounter will be suspicious or up to no good increase. The Encounters table below contains events, like super flares and mine fields. These are of course not encounters in any strict sense of the word, but for simplicity’s sake they have been included in the table anyway.</p><h4>ENCOUNTERS ON PLANETS</h4><p>If the GM should so desire, the Reactions table (47) can be used for planet side encounters as well. The city has the same modifiers as Portal zone, Countryside counts as Habitable zone and Wilderness is equal to Deep space zone.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 46 Frequency of Encounters</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 46 Frequency of Encounters]</p><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>REGION</th><th>FREQUENCY</th><th>REACTION MOD TO TABLE 47</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Portal zone (0.5 AU from the portal)</td><td>One every two hours</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Core zone (0.5-3 AU from the portal)</td><td>Two per day</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Habitable zone (3-10 AU from the portal)</td><td>One per day</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Fringe zone (11-40 AU from the portal)</td><td>One every three days</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Deep space zone (40+ AU from the portal)</td><td>One per week</td><td>-2</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 47 Reactions</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 47 Reactions]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>REACTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>OPENLY HOSTILE.

The junk town is a cluttered amalgamation of small corporations and criminal gangs trying to make it on the fringes of the Conglomerate. The town is built from jungle wood, steel scraps, and the sweat of honest hands. Its residents make their living from logging, prospecting, and farming. This is where the PCs must try to find out what has happened to the stasis pods, either through persuasion, manipulation, stealth, or brute force. Shortly after the PCs' arrival, the Shaukar guerilla attacks the outpost in order to free the hands living there in bondage.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The Baybasin outpost is the first glimpse of civilization the PCs get as they exit the jungle. Have the PCs arrive at dusk to establish the settlement as a dark, dirty place whose residents work around the clock. Artyr Gholâm is preparing to leave town. Through clues found in earlier scenes, the PCs may have figured out that he is the stasis beds' intended recipient and very likely to know their final destination. Artyr can be found in his residence on the north side of the settlement.</p><p>As the PCs arrive, the Shaukar guerilla launch an attack on the town to liberate its people. The exact timing of their attack is up to you as the GM to decide. Information about Artyr and the stasis beds' final destination can be obtained from several different sources to make the transition to Act II smooth and easy:</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARTYR UNDER PRESSURE</h5><p>By either manipulating or burgling and threatening Artyr, he can be made to give up information about the stasis pods (from his shipping manifest and tag). This information can also be obtained by threatening or torturing Ramses or one of his Jackals.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HEROES OF THE PEOPLE</h5><p>If the PCs assist the guerilla in their dawn raid and manage to overthrow Raquin Birbasil, Shaukar officer Dali Osman will send out scouts and spies to find out where the stasis beds go after Baybasin. They will return with information from the spaceport, or with a tortured Jackal. Alternatively, if you let Artyr escape (see below), the guerilla might have apprehended him and will deliver him, beaten to a pulp, to the PCs for them to treat as they please. If this is the case, disregard his reputation score when he is interrogated by the PCs, and he might even tell them what he knows about Salamah ach-Abaud’s involvement.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BIRBASILS' GRATITUDE</h5><p>If the PCs accept and carry out Raquin Birbasil’s mission to escort Artyr and protect her from the guerilla attack, she will provide them with the information they need from the late merchant’s office or from a Jackal with sufficient respect and fear for the Syndicate. The PCs are invited to Raquin’s mansion and shown to a room in the basement, tiled in blue and white, with a miniature delta of tiny canals flowing along the walls. Either Ramses or one of his Jackals is tied up in the room, and the PCs are left to carry out their interrogation however they please.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The journey through the jungle has taken the PCs to the mining outpost of Baybasin. This is where Ramses' Jackals deliver the stasis beds to Artyr Gholâm for transportation down the Ramishah. The following details are important for you as the GM to convey to the PCs before they leave for the Conglomerate:</p><ul><li><strong>The Smugglers</strong>: Ramses' Jackals are a known group in town and they have been hired by Artyr Gholâm.</li><li><strong>The Merchant</strong>: Artyr Gholâm runs a small shipping company working the river to the Conglomerate. His office and warehouse is located on the factory island by the river, near the spaceport (see Places in Baybasin below).</li><li><strong>The Stasis Pods</strong>: The units are loaded onto river barges at Artyr’s office, which local stevedores can testify to. According to Artyr (and his minutely detailed manifest), the barges carry the cargo to the Khabal district in Little Algol, in the shadow of the Monolith. The last shipment departed almost immediately after arriving at Artyr’s warehouse. No stasis beds remain in Baybasin.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FURTHER INFORMATION</h5><p>Inquisitive PCs may also find out some of the following during their stay in Baybasin:</p><ul><li><strong>Local Rulers</strong>: Baybasin in under the control of the Birbasil family, one of the major Syndicate families.</li><li><strong>Bad Blood</strong>: Artyr has gotten on bad terms with Raquin Birbasil after dumping a shipment of opor in the river to avoid arrest, and rumors have it that Raquin is planning to replace the current shipping company with a more loyal one.</li><li><strong>Payment</strong>: Bars of neodym can be found in Artyr’s home which he has received as payment for his services from Salamah ach-Abaud and that he has used to pay Ramses' Jackals.</li><li><strong>Employer</strong>: If Artyr is beaten or tortured, he will reveal that Salamah ach-Abaud is the one who hired him, but that payment was handled by intermediaries in Little Algol.</li></ul><h4>BIRBASIL TERRITORY</h4><p>Baybasin is a textbook example of a class society with rampant inequality. The living conditions of the common people are abysmal and the divide between government and the governed is oceans wide. The social divide is manifested by the Ramishah that runs through the city, separating the clean, well-constructed north side – home to various entrepreneurs and business akbars – from the southern shantytowns where the hands and slaves live. Baybasin is so remote that practically none of the slaves are in chains – escaping into the wilderness would almost certainly mean death. Criticizing the rulers here is dangerous and pointless. Hands who raise their voices have a tendency to go missing. That being said, the population is far from broken – under the calm surface, rebellion is brewing.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/flod5.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INDUSTRY</h5><p>All business in the outpost is connected to the Birbasil family in one way or another. There is a small coltan mine on the slopes underneath Verkâna Ridge, a coal mine half a day’s journey to the east, and several large poppy plantations to the north. The outskirts on all sides are swidden farmlands-to-be, with the occasional clearcut and tabak or palm oil plantations here and there. In the central bazaar in the shantytown, one finds peddlers of scavenged or stolen tech, jungle game or fish from the river or the deep, dark sinkhole lake. Slavetrading is done more or less in the open here, fronted by Algolans secretly working for wealthy Zenithian families.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HISTORY</h5><p>The booming mining town of Hyderas was originally constructed by exiled Sadaalian count Efrem un-Awaan under mysterious circumstances in CC 29. Tales from the first settlers to move to Hyderas have survived and accuse Efrem of having made a pact with the powerful efrit Tarwa-ghan in his quest for fame and wealth. Legend says that Tarwa-ghan showed Efrem the way to underground riches, but cursed the place in return. For thirteen years, the jungles gave up their fruits to Efrem, but eventually turned on him, demanding payment in blood for every gram. The Hyderas spaceport collapsed during the quakes of CC 42, Efrem disappeared and the area was abandoned. The riches of Verkâna Ridge lay undisturbed until the Colonial Agency heard about the abandoned coltan mine in CC 50 and sent new prospectors to the area. Apart from a Sogoi tribe calling themselves The Servants of the Pit, no one was around to resist the faction’s new plans for expansion. The mine was restored to working order, but the sinkhole soon started to claim victims once again. The mine collapsed again in CC 57 and the Agency chose to sell the town to the Birbasils in return for secret, shady services up on Coriolis.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GOVERNMENT</h5><p>Although officially independent, informal leadership lies with Raquin Birbasil and her two sons Aulus and Oto. The Birbasils' interests here are mainly in poppy growing and they therefore own most of the fertile lands around the settlement. Other companies operate here by the crime family’s permission and pay the Birbasils regular fees to remain in the area, under the protection of the mercenary company The Righteous Brigade.</p><p>Other prominent names in Baybasin include:</p><ul><li><strong>Mori Dakka (mineral prospector)</strong> – Mori is responsible for a big portion of the claims in the area and is one of the major employers of unaffiliated daylaborers – hands brave or desperate enough to enter the semi-waterfilled coltan mine or undertake the arduous trek through the jungle to the unstable coal mine a few hours away. Mori lives in the part of the shanytown that clings to the slopes of Verkâna Ridge – called Mining Town – in a log cabin at the end of a serpentine road, surrounded by a terraced garden. If a powerful smell of fresh chai hangs around the cabin, Mori is probably at home – she can otherwise be found overseeing work at one of her claims or in the cantina near the docks.</li><li><strong>Hashema Behari (ex-Legionnaire)</strong> – Coordinator of all scavenging and hunting in the area and therefore the de facto ruler of the bazaar at the heart of the town. Hashema’s prospectors dive on the sunken ruins of the old spaceport and scavenge more or less useful objects that end up for sale in the markets. They also supply the local smokehouses and boiling Bamsieh pots with the surprisingly meaty and delicious rubiyan crab that only lives in the deep waters of the sinkhole. Behari is an ex-Legionnaire who chose a simple life on Kua after the Tanshiin confrontation in the Yastapol system in CC 51.</li><li><strong>Tanam ed-Garaam (free trader)</strong> – The Free League have taken over the old hangar near the new spaceport and have a virtually unchallenged monopoly on stevedoring in the spaceport and on the river barges. The operation is run by Tanam ed-Garaam, an old customs officer, who seems to know everything about everyone who does business in the area, but who makes sure to stay on Raquin Birbasil’s good side.</li></ul><h4>SECURITY</h4><p>Local law is enforced by the Nestera-owned mercenaries The Righteous Brigade, paid for by the Birbasils. The Righteous, led by Aidjaz Moreno, have in turn recruited a corrupt militia to handle the day-to-day operations. The real reason for the Righteous accepting the mission is so that they can study the Shaukar guerilla up close, but this is a secret even to Raquin.</p><ul><li><strong>The Militia</strong> – The militia numbers around a hundred strong and have a somewhat questionable approach to their mandate. The troop is made up of more or less shady elements from all over Kua, all affiliated with the Birbasils in one way or another. Most of them have no military training, and lack of discipline has made many of them prone to dirty dealings outside of their mission. Their gear is poor and they are known to take bribes wherever they can get them. Their leader is a cutthroat by the name of Barabbas who answers directly to colonel Moreno.</li><li><strong>The Exo Squadron</strong> – The pride of the militia is its exo squadron, consisting of five exos in bad shape – salvaged from the sinkhole. The squadron is commanded by the aging engineer Marsamas.</li></ul><h4>PLACES IN BAYBASIN</h4><p>A few of the important places in Baybasin are described below:</p>@JournalEntry[Baybasin Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HYDERAS SINKHOLE</h5><p>The old Hyderas fell into an enormous sinkhole in CC 42 and only the parts of the city constructed on the rocky slopes of Verkâna Ridge survived. The sinkhole exposed a large natural cave system and an underground river coming from the plateau above. Old technology and several large spaceships are buried deep in the muddy waters, making the hole a veritable goldmine for the bold divers who dare explore the caves underneath the town.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE COLTAN MINE</h5><p>One of the mouths from which the underground river bursts forth belowVerkâna Ridge connects to the deep cave system underneath the plateau. A major reason for the return of civilization to Baybasin was the discovery of the rare metal coltan there, which prompted the Colonial Agency to found a new outpost. In the aftermath of a political power struggle on Coriolis, the outpost was taken over by the Syndicate who now control the mine and the deliveries of coltan to the Conglomerate and the tech labs in Covenant City.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE POPPY FIELDS</h5><p>The Birbasils' largest export commodity from Baybasin, aside from the coltan, is the fast-growing strain of poppies that thrive in the rich soil around the outpost. The harvest is processed on site and then hidden in coltan shipments or crates of salvage from the sinkhole to avoid detection. The concentrated poppy juice is then transported to refineries in the Conglomerate or to the gangs on Coriolis for distribution.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NORTH TOWN</h5><p>North Town – socioeconomically speaking – starts at the spaceport and continues over the bridge to the Birbasils' gated community of warehouses, poppy fields, and masterfully landscaped mansions. The factory island is also a part of North Town. The island houses the other larger trading houses – such as Artyr Gholâm’s – as well as the factionary businesses and the various freight companies.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SOUTH TOWN</h5><p>The messy shantytowns clinging to edges of the sinkhole are collectively referred to as South Town. As the rock underneath is slowly eroded by the underground river and aggressive coltan mining, more and more houses on the edge run the risk of sliding into the waters. The people of South Town live one day at a time, taking whatever jobs they can to feed their families.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BASIL BRIDGE</h5><p>The bridge that connects the spaceport to the Birbasil domains was constructed by the Colonial Engineers when the faction founded their outpost and the sturdy colossus looks as reliable today as it did ten cycles ago. A handful of militia members are always around to keep watch, with at least one exo soldier as backup.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DOCKS</h5><p>The Baybasin docks are a chaotic maze of jetties and pontoons, welded-together rows of derelict barges and rafts, old shacks, and warehouses. Cranes tower over mine cars brimming with ore and coal from the local mines. Free League stevedores work here around the clock, as well as daylaborers who get called in to cover especially busy shifts. The air is heavy and the water black from soot and mineral dust. At the edges of the docks, the workers' barracks give way to simple cantinas, gambling dens, and over-crowded residential units, wedged in-between the souk and the bustling life of the loading piers.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE BIRBASILS</h5><p>The Birbasils' domains are separated from the noise of the rest of the town by the grey green waters of the Ramishah. Behind a high brick wall, decorated with beautiful mosaics and crowned with broken glass, one can just spot the upper floors of the family’s whitewashed headquarters. The grand mansion stands out from the rest of the settlement with its clean walls and sophisticated design and has a well-kept garden surrounding it. Red poppies grow all the way up to the outer walls, and a couple of warehouses nearby are used for distribution of goods to and from the much calmer north docks. Only a handful of workers' barracks are located on this side of the river, and most workers have to line up by the bridge before their shifts, sometimes for hours, and wait for the guards and overseers to let them cross the river.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARTYR GHOLÂM’S OFFICES</h5><p>Artyr’s offices, Ghôl-Akandra, are located in the business district near the spaceport and look like most other houses in Baybasin – low and a bit crooked, built from jungle wood and sheets of corrugated metal. Artyr normally receives visitors accompanied by Ramses and two bodyguards, usually on the roof terrace above the office. Chilled palm wine and dates are served and Artyr makes polite conversation about the economical boom that is sure to come any day now. After the first glass is emptied, he is ready to discuss business.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE OFFICES OF THE FREE LEAGUE</h5><p>A modest warehouse constructed when the area was repopulated houses the offices of the Free League. After the Syndicate took over Baybasin a few segments ago – after which trade has increased in the region – the Free League acquired some limited trading rights, exporting raw materials and scavenged goods. The faction organizes the stevedore force in the spaceport as well as on the barges in the docks. They have made a deal with the Birbasils to supply the Syndicate with workers for the poppy fields. The League’s local administrator, ex-customs officer Tanam ed-Garaam, is working hard to improve labor conditions for workers in Baybasin but has little leverage to speak of when dealing with Raquin Birbasil.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE NEW SPACE PORT</h5><p>Rather than repeating old mistakes, the Colonial Agency chose to build the new spaceport on more solid ground. A high head on the eastern side of the ridge is now home to a flat area paved with stones that functions as a landing strip, surrounded on three sides by the green waters of the Ramishah.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HARBOR SOUK</h5><p>At the center of the settlement – between South Town, the factory island, and the spaceport – we find Baybasin’s heart, the harbor souk. Most local business goes through here one way or another. Food, produce, and opor milk are sold in various stalls here and scavenged treasures from Hashema’s divers are displayed on dirty rugs on the ground, with indentured Sogoi or orphans hunched over the piles, scrubbing the mud off the merchandise. Coltan ore and coal can also be bought here, but the quality for sale is usually stray pieces found in the river.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> MEESAN’S CANTINA</h5><p>The group of shacks crowding the edge of the sinkhole, between the noisy souk and the busy spaceport, houses entertainment establishments catering to worn-out prospectors and miners. The largest den of sin on the block is Meesan’s Cantina, known as the Scales by its patrons. The Menkar humanite sisters Ana and Mandri Meesan run the place, usually hiding their forked, highly sensitive tongues by speaking as little as possible. They are extremely good at reading their customers however, and have honed their skills to almost eerie perfection after Ana was blessed by the Icons and developed empathic mystic powers when the Emissaries arrived at the Xene station.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  DAHK’S OPOR DEN</h5><p>The area on the banks of the black river that snakes its way out of the coltan mine is run by slaver gangs and inhabited by mine slaves. This is where a visitor looking to lose herself goes to find Dakh’s opor den. Dahk is an old Sogoi slave, long since freed from bondage, who has created a refuge from the woes of the world in an abandoned, semi-collapsed customs house. The floors are covered in worn rugs and dirty pillows, beds line the walls and a bowl of sugar globes in the middle of the room is the only light source. The place is frequented by Baybasin’s desperate and down-trodden, looking to spend their last birr on a few hours of narcotic escapism. Dakh’s trusty helper Jasmina is actually a Shaukar agent, reporting what the patrons let slip while under the influence directly to Dali Osman.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>In this scene, the PCs are likely to encounter Artyr Gholâm, his bodyguards (for whom you can use the Jackals' stats on page 102 @Actor[Ramses' Jackals - Algolan]), @Actor[Ramses] (page 104), and perhaps also Raquin Birbasil. They might also run into the militia and soldiers from the Shaukar guerilla (see Events below).</p><ul><li>@Actor[Artyr Gholâm]</li><li>@Actor[Raquin Birbasil]</li><li>@Actor[Militia Members]</li><li>@Actor[Dali Osman]</li><li>@Actor[Shaukar Officers]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The events in On the Brink revolve around the PCs' different ways of finding the clues they need, but also include the Shaukar guerilla’s attack on Baybasin. The raid begins at dawn, regardless of whether the PCs are in on the plans or not. If they were not part of planning the attack, the GM chooses three preparation actions from the Shaukar’s Gift event that automatically fail. The The Uprising Begins event is more or less mandatory, but as the GM, you are of course free to change the scene to your liking.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> MOUNTING UNREST</h5><p>The muddy streets are littered with leaflets saying “Freedom is coming – Shaukar will liberate Baybasin” in both Zeni and the local dialect. Workers stop what they are doing to read the short message. Whispers become murmurs become chanting. A crowd assembles with violence in their eyes. The group begins chanting “Free Baybasin!”, but suddenly stops, and the street empties as quickly as it filled. Only the PCs remain and it becomes obvious why the crowd scattered – the militia is fast approaching, one of the soldiers in an old loader exo with heavy weapons welded onto it. For 1 DP, you can have the crowd stay in the street and challenge the militia, but after one of the people at the front is impaled on the exo soldier’s sword, the threat of smoke grenades and more violence from the militia captain is enough to make the rest of the demonstrators turn and run. If the PCs attack the militia and prove themselves (or are arrested), you can choose to have them escorted to Raquin Birbasil for a private meeting (see the The Birbasils Intervene event below).</p><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AUDIENCE WITH ARTYR</h5><p>If the PCs want to visit Artyr, getting an audience is no problem. The offices of his shipping business Ghôl-Akandra can be found on the beachfront of the factory island with a view of the Ramishah and the plantations on the other side. Artyr’s servant Yoham handles his schedule and can arrange a meeting. Depending on the PCs' Reputation scores and if one of them has the Faction standing talent, Artyr will see them sooner or later. If the Jackals haven’t returned to Baybasin, he will be frightened and ask Yoham to stall the PCs while he heads for the spaceport. The PCs should have a decent chance to figure out that he is making a run for it by testing <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong>, <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> or some appropriate talent. During the meeting with Artyr, the PCs can find out the following:</p><ul><li>He is a businessman who helps his customers avoid “unnecessary” tolls and taxes.</li><li>He will not admit to having anything to do with human trafficking, the martyr strike team, or the Order of the Pariah. If he is pressed on these issues, he will skillfully dodge the questions and steer the conversation toward safer topics.</li><li>If the PCs confront him with evidence of his connections to the smuggling of the captured mystics, he will ask them to take their lies elsewhere and tell his bodyguards to show these lunatics out. If any of the Jackals are still alive, he will order them to dispose of the PCs as soon as the sun sets (see the Daggers in the Dark event below).</li><li>If the PCs attack Artyr’s bodyguards and then threaten the merchant, he will surrender a tag containing a manifest detailing where the mystics are taken (see Artyr’s gear and the Artyr’s Escape event).</li><li>If Ramses has survived a confrontation with the PCs, their request for a meeting with Artyr will be denied. He will send both his bodyguards and the Jackals to take care of the PCs while he himself heads for the spaceport.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BURGLING ARTYR’S OFFICE</h5><p>The PCs might also choose to burgle, or shoot their way into, Artyr’s offices to find his manifest ledger. The building is guarded by three of his bodyguards (for whom you can use the militia stats). If shots are fired outside of the office, the militia will arrive there shortly after, unless the PCs have made a deal with Raquin Birbasil (see the The Birbasils Intervene event).<br />Artyr’s daily routine looks like this:</p><ul><li>He gets up early, eats breakfast, and climbs into his palanquin for the trip to the market, where he inspects all new findings brought up by the divers.</li><li>He then goes to the office and works for a few hours. His house slave prepares his lunch.</li><li>He rests for a few hours in the afternoon, after which he entertains potential new clients and negotiates business with the other local merchants.</li><li>Some nights, he is called down to the docks to oversee important shipments coming in or shipping out.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WEAKEST LINK</h5><p>The PCs might use Ramses and the Jackals to get to Artyr or to get information about the stasis beds. Ramses usually keeps to himself, busy fighting inner demons in a thick opor haze on the floors of Dakh’s. The other Jackals are more out and about, spending most days in the cantinas drinking themselves blind. The nights tend to end with them paying or threatening unlucky passersby to carry them home after they pass out. Kidnapping a drunk Jackal is easy, but if the other smugglers figure out what is going on, they will fight for their comrade.</p><ul><li><strong>Aeza, kidnapped smuggler</strong>: She will not tell the PCs anything about Ramses or her comrades even if the PCs successfully interrogate her using <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong>, but if they achieve a critical success on the roll, she will point them in the direction of Little Algol. If the PCs use torture, they get a +2 to their roll, but this generates 1 DP for the GM.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (May generate 1 DP)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE BIRBASILS INTERVENE</h5><p>If one of the PCs have the Faction standing: The Syndicate talent, or if they either helped the militia in the Eyes and Ears scene or fought the militia in the Mounting Unrest event above, they will be called to the Birbasil headquarters. They will be slipped a tag by a street urchin containing a short message instructing them to come to the Birbasil manor on the other side of Basil Bridge. They will have to leave their weapons with the guards at the door before they are allowed in to see Raquin Birbasil. She is very upfront – she wants the PCs to kill Artyr Gholâm for her. In return, they will get his ledger, 2,000 birr, and the Syndicate’s gratitude. If they decline, Raquin will instead try to have the PCs murdered to keep them from warning Artyr about her intentions (see the Daggers in the Dark event below).</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SHAUKAR’S GIFT</h5><p>If the PCs have helped the common people during their trek through the jungles, they will be approached by Jasmina, the Shaukar guerilla’s mole in Baybasin. She will ask them to help in the uprising over a glass of kohôl in a shady cantina. Their reward will be information about Artyr and his ledger. If they accept, the scouts Haquim and Aqueda will materialize from the shadows and escort the PCs to their shack, where they can spend the night and wait for the arrival of Dali Osman. The PCs are thoroughly questioned about their motivations for helping the guerilla, and then briefed on the plan of attack. The guerilla aim to fan the flames of the working hands’ shame and anger, seize the factory island and the spaceport, and kidnap or kill Raquin Birbasil and her sons.<br />If the PCs choose to aid the guerilla, their relationship with the Syndicate will be significantly affected (–2 in all dealings with the faction in the Kua system). The PCs can help the guerilla in a number of ways, for example by helping with the preparations below:</p><ul><li><strong>Popular Support</strong>: The guerilla cannot take Baybasin without the support of its residents. Jasmina has instructed demagogue Sirwan Rusar to rally the people behind the Shaukar banner, but many are still on the fence. If the PCs pass a demanding (–1) manipulation test, they can get the doubters onboard. If they fail, you could play the Mounting Unrest event above, but without it costing you a DP.</li><li><strong>Levelling the Field</strong>: The Birbasils’ stranglehold on Baybasin can be broken by convincing their allies to switch sides. The PCs might be sent to recruit either ex-Legionnaire Hashema Behari, stevedore akbar Tanam ed-Garaam, or mining akbar Mori Dakka to the cause. Each of the three require a –2 manipulation test to convince, but for every one of them to switch sides, the PCs get a +1 when convincing those remaining. A failed roll means that the person warns Raquin Birbasil and threatens their workforce, which leads to a –1 modifier for the Popular Support roll above and that both the bridge and the Birbasil manor are reinforced. Raquin will also dispatch a militia squad to take care of the PCs (See the Daggers in the Dark event below). Each of the recruiting attempts count as separate preparation actions.</li><li><strong>Arming the Struggle</strong>: The PCs can help the guerilla smuggling arms and explosives into the settlement. Have them test observation, infiltration, and manipulation, and a failed roll should lead to the militia finding out that something is about to happen and the uprising beginning prematurely.</li><li><strong>Artillery Fire</strong>: Grenade launchers must be set up around Baybasin. The guerilla have only limited experience with heavy weapons, and a PC with a military background can help them find strategically advantageous, defendable positions for the launchers (command). A failed roll means that Basil Bridge will be very hard to cross, as the militia is alerted and the entire exo squad is deployed to protect the Birbasils’ domains.</li><li><strong>Sabotage</strong>: The exo squad should be taken care of (or at the very least decimated) before the attack begins. It can be handled either by sabotaging the exos or by incapacitating the pilots. Failure means that the militia is made aware of the danger and extra protection is added around the Birbasil manor.</li></ul><p>Each of the preparation actions above should take a few hours, so the PCs will have time for three actions before the attack begins. In addition to what is described above, each failure also means that the preparation in question takes twice as long (two failures automatically starts the attack) and generates 2 DP for the GM.<br />Should the PCs need it, the guerilla can supply them with some basic gear (one weapon and one piece of gear per PC):</p><ul><li>Weapons: Vulcan carbine with 2 reloads or Vulcan pistol with 4 reloads</li><li>Gear: Frag grenade, ordinary tools, or medkit</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Generates 2 DP per failed preparation)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DAGGERS IN THE DARK</h5><p>Ramses’ Jackals or the Birbasil militia stages an ambush in an alley in Baybasin to silence the PCs for good.</p><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE UPRISING BEGINS</h5><p>As the day dawns, the Shaukar attack begins. Their plan is to rally the hands in South Town and then move on to securing the factory island while the grenade launchers provide fire support. They then plan to move on the spaceport, fortifying the Free League hangars there and using them as a base of operations when launching the final assault across the bridge to seize the Birbasil manor. A barrage of mortar fire across the river will stop the North Town merchants and the Syndicate leadership from fleeing. In addition to the consequences of failed preparations in Shaukar’s Gift above, the fighting may also result in the PCs finding themselves in the following situations:</p><ul><li><strong>Attacked by Guerillas/the Militia</strong>: Three soldiers attack the PCs as they believe them to be hostile combatants.</li><li><strong>Mortar Fire</strong>: A stray grenade comes screaming through the air toward the PCs. PCs who fail a demanding (–1) dexterity test are hit by a blast effect 8 attack (see page 98 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</li><li><strong>The Exo Squad Attacks</strong>: Two soldiers in exos attack the PCs. The battle lasts for three turns before the surrounding chaos separates the parties.</li><li><strong>Massacre</strong>: The PCs witness members of the militia starting to shoot at unarmed civilians. Unless they intervene, 1 DP is generated for the GM.</li><li><strong>A Call to Arms</strong>: If the PCs successfully recruited at least one of the Birbasils’ allies during Levelling the Field above, they call on reinforcements during the attack in the form of three hands loyal to either Hashema (scavengers), Mori (miners), or Tanam (stevedores). Use the @Actor[Stevedore Thugs] stats found on page 32 of In the Wake of the Martyr. They can call on reinforcements once for each of the three akbars they successfully recruited, and each use generates 1 DP for the GM.</li></ul><p>If the guerilla (and/or the PCs) manages to reach the Birbasil manor and kidnap or kill Raquin and her sons, the militia will surrender and the battle is won. The guerilla is temporarily in control of Baybasin, but for how long is uncertain. If the attack fails, the militia begins a vicious purge of the city to find and deal with Shaukar sympathizers. Regardless, the PCs must find the information they need about the fate of the prisoners in stasis and then either chase Artyr down the river, or set off for Little Algol.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory, may generate DP)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARTYR’S ESCAPE</h5><p>When the attack begins (or earlier, if he was tipped off about the PCs somehow), Artyr will attempt to flee Baybasin, taking his manifest ledger with him. He will forget to wipe his decryption software at the office however, and a copy of the manifest can be extracted from it by passing an easy (+1) data djinn test. The message from @Actor[Salamah Ach-Abaud] (page 101) can also be found here if Ramses retrieved it from the crash site and made it back to Baybasin. A search of Artyr’s residence reveals a stash of metal bars coated in kerosene. If the bars are analyzed, they turn out to be neodym, a very rare metal on Kua. A successful technology test can tell the PCs that neodym is used in components that go into advanced machines such as stasis beds and lasers. Testing science reveals that neodym is mined on asteroids, which makes it hard to say exactly from where these bars have come.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"i0lMHZVhlMfGsKv8","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297040,"modifiedTime":1682695297040,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"rCD14X1CtExeUz12","sort":0,"_id":"ZmLOGV9eG8ZXEo0q"}

Some say that they might as well just join the Consortium, but this would not be in the corporations’ best interest – it would mean one less Zenithian vote on the Council.</p><p>The two flagships Shahrazad and Dunyazad and their escort, the only survivors from Shadussar’s 2nd Fleet after the Portal Wars, founded the Legion. When the fleets from the First Horizon were about to attack Mira, some of Shadussar’s forces were diverted to set up an ambush there, but as the enemies took the Odacon route – and were destroyed there, along with the rest of Shadussar’s fleets – they survived. During the chaotic years that followed the end of the war, the survivors traveled the Horizon as warlords and corsairs. Many of the horrors perpetrated during those years can be traced back to the Legion – something they refuse to acknowledge today, of course.</p><p>When the Zenith arrived and the Consortium was founded, this new and powerful employer suddenly meant new possibilities. The Legion of today was born. They were originally hired by the Consortium to wipe out the fleets of the Zenithian Hegemony, but suffered terrible losses and retreated, instead being tasked with hunting corsairs, greedy nobles or any other who would threaten the Consortium’s interests.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE FLEET</h5><p>Few know how large the fleet of the Legion really is. The larger ships are well documented by both the Special Branch and other factions, but the disappearance of Shahrazad and the rumors of hidden bases beg the uneasy answer that the size of the fleet may have been underestimated. Only two other factions have war fleets of their own: the Zenithian Hegemony and the Order of the Pariah.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/Legionen_fraktion.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LEGION ORGANIZATION</h5><p>The Legion of today is still centered on the two flagships, but is otherwise organized as three separate branches: the fleet, the companies and the Guard. To many, the fleet represents the true Legion. Even though one of the flagships has gone missing – or is away on a secret mission – the fleet is growing, new ships coming in from the docks on Sadaal and many other yards. The exact size of the fleet is unknown. Supposedly, the Legion still has access to secret bases all over the Horizon left behind since the chaotic years, but no one knows for sure. The Consortium is the only faction who uses the fleet today.</p><p>The companies are the everyday faces of the Legion. Many different factions employ this branch for all sorts of missions. The companies are not a uniform army as much as they are a jumbled mess of mercenary groups who can access lucrative jobs through their membership in the Legion. The faction has strict rules that detail how a mission should be carried out, and all member companies must obey the rules or face expulsion and have their leaders hunted down and executed. This makes for plenty of jobs available to free companies – they get paid less, but have no rules to follow.</p><p>The Coriolis Guard is the branch with the lowest reputation. They answer directly to the governor of Coriolis and are responsible for keeping the peace on the station, but they are too corrupt to be any good at it. Other Legionnaires view them as fake mercs or proxy Legionnaires. Woe to the unlucky Legionnaire who gets injured badly enough to be demoted to the Guard.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  HEROES OF THE LEGION</h5><p>Suhaima Taslim, the disabled Legionnaire who represents the faction at the Council, is but one of many war heroes who pride themselves on sporting the Legion’s skull tattoo. Jasma “Kyber” Palu is a heavily modified soldier with both visible and hidden cybernetics who leads the half-crazed Steel Skulls unit. She gladly accepts dangerous jobs that come with high risk of injury, and thus, a good chance of new mods. The skipper Skalide dol-Gana in her fast fighter Xantus is famous for her skills as a blockade runner and corsair hunter.

The players are drawn into a mystery that shakes the Coriolis station to its core: the disappearance of the enigmatic Emissary from <strong>Xene</strong>.</h3><p><strong>In the wake</strong> of the Martyr, the PCs stumble upon a ruthless conspiracy against the mystics of the Coriolis station. As the group is about to meet up with an old friend, they end up in the middle of a bloody attack, and become inescapably connected to the chain of events that eventually culminates with the Emissary’s disappearance. In the end, it is up to the PCs to discover the truth about the fate of the mystics and the lost Emissary.</p><h4>BACKGROUND</h4><p>Ever since the first reports of their appearance, the mystics have been the focus of intense debate on Coriolis. From the gutter to the throne rooms, everyone has an opinion about the people upon whom these strange and fearsome gifts have been bestowed – be it one of blind hate or pious jealousy. Hate crimes against mystics are on the rise and some have been so badly persecuted that they have been forced to leave their families and flee Coriolis. Most mystics, while they struggle to control their newfound powers, have been able to live lives almost like before their powers manifested – until now. Recently, a wave of disappearances has befallen the mystic community. Just in the last segment, over two dozen people have vanished without a trace, and another ten have turned up dead – murdered. The Guard, the Judicators, and the Council have yet to address the issue with any real interest, but a few within their ranks have begun to realize that something very big and very strange is afoot in the shadows. Street reporters have dubbed the bizarre crime wave ”the Mysticides”.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WARRIORS OF THE HOLY LIGHT</h5><p>The truth of the matter is that a so-called martyr strike team from Zalos called The Warriors of the Holy Light are orchestrating a cleansing of Coriolis, to purge the station of all mystics, who they believe to be heretics and heralds of darkness. The strike team has split up into two groups, secretly watching, kidnapping, and sometimes murdering people they identify as mystics. Most victims are drugged and taken to a secret vault in the Cellar where they are put in stasis and loaded onto drop pods for transportation to the strike team’s secret base – an abandoned hyper sickness research facility in the Kuan jungles. The fate of the mystics who survive long enough to wake up at the secret base is often one worse than death.</p><p>The strike team, led by Zalosian officer Salamah ach-Abaud, is preparing to strike against their top priority target: the Emissary from Xene. Unbeknownst to the martyr warriors, the Zenithian Hegemony have infiltrated the strike team to further the faction’s political interests, and it is the Hegemony’s ambassador, Johar Quassar, who has arranged access to the Emissary’s residence for the warriors.</p><p>The strike team’s plans have been ruthlessly executed, and many of the station’s residents are secretly relieved to be rid of the mystics. The authorities' response is too weak and too slow and when the Emissary is kidnapped, the game is over – the strike team’s mission has been carried out and the balance of power in the Third Horizon has changed forever. There is however one factor that neither the Warriors of the Holy Light nor the scheming politicians secretly directing them have taken into account: the PCs.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>Through the disappearance of a friend or relative, the PCs end up in the middle of a bloody purge against the mystics of Coriolis. The search for the missing friend and the people responsible will lead them toward the guilty parties: the Warriors of the Holy Light. The strike team is a splinter group from the Order of the Pariah that is being manipulated by the Hegemony’s secret police, the Astûrban, to carry out a spectacular action onboard Coriolis. The Hegemony’s endgame is to bring war and chaos to the Third Horizon – and to rise victorious from the ashes, conquerors of worlds</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 1 – THE MYSTICIDES (page 16)</h5>@JournalEntry[00 - The Mysticides]<p>In The Mysticides, the PCs will discover a nefarious plot threatening the lives of all the station’s mystics – and in the end, the station itself. When a friend of the group disappears, the PCs end up right in the middle of a bloody attack in the spaceport, and their search for the perpetrators of the Mysticides begins.</p><p>During their investigation, the PCs will meet the corrupt inspector Merk Ahuro and the ambitious reporter Jeyla Kuhari. The leads found by the PCs will point in the direction of one Aram Yafa, a mystic forced to act as bait for the martyr strike team. The act ends with the abduction of the Emissary.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 2 – HIGH STAKES (page 38)</h5>@JournalEntry[00 - High Stakes]<p>In the second act, the PCs are contacted by judge Kurahan through the mysterious judicator Akouba. They are told that the disappearance of the Emissary was no coincidence – the same organization responsible for massacring the mystics of the station is also behind the kidnapping of the Emissary. Judge Kurahan doesn’t trust the Coriolis Guard to handle the matter, so she turns to the PCs for help and grants them access to investigate the residence of the Emissary in the Spire. After a visit to the residence and a meeting with Johar Quassar, the Zenithian Hegemony’s ambassador to the Council, the clues point the PCs in the direction of the Samaritan Sanatorium. When they arrive there, they get a taste of Sister Robwah’s righteous fury and encounter the wavering Brother Ramas, who proposes a clandestine meeting in the Garden of Seekers. Before Ramas is able to reveal the truth about the missing mystics to the PCs, the strike team attempts to silence him for good. Whether he survives or not, the PCs get their hands on a tag with access codes to the innermost halls of the Sanatorium. The pieces are rapidly falling into place, and everything seems to point toward the Cellar.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 3 – THE ABYSS (page 63)</h5>@JournalEntry[00 - The Abyss]<p>In the final act of the scenario, the PCs descend into the darkness of the Cellar. They encounter Slummer Queen Elmeda and other shady characters, who will challenge the PCs with difficult choices. Finally, they will make it to the forgotten loading bay used as a base of operations by the strike team and there discover the fate of the missing mystics – they have been sent down to the dark jungles of Kua.</p><h4>FACTIONS AND GROUPS</h4><p>The Coriolis station is the hub of civilization in the Third Horizon and ripe with tension and intrigue even before this scenario begins. In The Wake of the Martyr, three of the key factions are directly involved in the events that are about to unfold – the Order of the Pariah, the Zenithian Hegemony, and the Consortium.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>MAJOR CHARACTERS</h4><ul><li><strong>@Actor[Akouba Kosha]</strong> – Judicator loyal to the hegemonists (page 43)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Althea]</strong> – Mystic on the run (page 19)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Aram Yafa]</strong> – The strike team’s bait (page 31)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Brother Ramas]</strong> – Samaritan with a guilty conscience (page 54)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Elmeda dol-Parnasso]</strong> – Slummer Queen in the Cellar (page 72)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Johar Quassar]</strong> – Ambassador for the Zenithian Hegemony (page 52)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Nigelia Kurahan-dol-Fahsra]</strong> – Judge with a mission for the PCs (page 41)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Lenove Astir]</strong> – Cultural attaché and spymaster (page 53)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Salamah Ach-Abaud]</strong> – Leader of the martyr strike team (page 88)</li><li><strong>Sister @Actor[Robwah]</strong> – Fundamentalist Samaritan Akbar (page 53)</li></ul></div><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/martyren_exp.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">The Martyr</p><p></p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ORDER OF THE PARIAH</h5><p>The Order is often portrayed as the biggest threat to peace in the Horizon and is demonized day and night by the Consortium through the Bulletin. It is true that the strictly religious order has an intolerant and unforgiving view on heresy and weak hearts, but the faction is at its core pragmatic and more concerned with survival than aggressive imperialism, which is something that is not reported on. The Order’s leadership view the Consortium and the Legion as the great enemy but are well aware that they would not win a battle against them both without help. Despite this pragmatic attitude, they are unable to control the splinter groups and fanatics within their ranks who choose actions before words.</p><p><strong>The Martyr Strike Team</strong>: In this scenario, the splinter group known as the Warriors of the Holy Light and their secret allies in the Sanatorium are the main antagonists, but the truth is not quite that simple – on Coriolis, it rarely is. The extremist warriors are actually right – the dark between the stars and the powers awakening in the mystics are directly connected to a mighty power that threatens the entire Third Horizon – just not in the way they think. Over the course of the scenario, the PCs will encounter various members of the strike team, including its leader, @Actor[Salamah Ach-Abaud] (page 88).</p><p><strong>The Samaritans</strong>: The Samaritan healer cult is quietly fading away onboard Coriolis – the widespread anti-Zalosian sentiments on the station have made sure that only the poorest and most vulnerable in society seek medical treatment at the Sanatorium. The hospital is run calmly but firmly by Sister Robwah, who secretly assists the Warriors of the Holy Light with transporting those lost to the mystic’s disease down to the Cellar for more “appropriate” care. No one except for Sister Robwah knows about these secret transports, neither in the Sanatorium nor in the various poorhouses run by the Samaritans on the station. The most important Samaritan in this scenario is @Actor[Brother Ramas] (page 54), since his qualms will lead to the unveiling of the strike team’s operation.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ZENITHIAN HEGEMONY</h5><p>The Order may appear to be the driving force in this scenario, but the Hegemony is hard at work in the shadows, plotting and deceiving. Under the leadership of the aging Abarren Quassar – once the captain of the Zenith – the Hegemony have taken it upon themselves to recapture their position as the leading and uniting force of the Third Horizon. To reach this goal, Quassar and a select few from the elite of the faction’s hierarchy have begun manipulating the Order of the Pariah, their archnemeses, through the Warriors of the Holy Light. In this scenario, the PCs will interact with the Hegemony through its ambassador @Actor[Johar Quassar] (page 52) and its cultural attaché and spy chief @Actor[Lenove Astir] (page 53).</p><p><strong>The Astûrban</strong>: The infamous secret police known as the Astûrban is a faction within a faction, and the part of the Zenithian Hegemony many believe to be the group’s de facto rulers. Headed by Lenove Astir, the Astûrban are aggressively trying to further Zenithian interests throughout the Horizon. It is Lenove Astir personally who has established contact with the Warriors of the Holy Light by feeding strategically beneficial information to the strike team’s leader, Salamah ach-Abaud. The Astûrban also have deep cover operatives working inside the Judicators to influence and spy on the affairs of the Consortium and the neo-Zenithians.</p><p><strong>The Judicators</strong>: The Zenithian Hegemony is loosely divided into two groups: the expansionist hegemonists, dominated by the Quassars and the Astûrban, and the more moderate neo-Zenithians ruled by the Arianites clan. The latter group also controls the Judicators and neither the Judicators nor the neo-Zenithians are involved in the conspiracy. At the start of The Wake of the Martyr, however, the PCs are unfortunate enough to encounter a judicator secretly loyal to the Quassars – @Actor[Akouba Kosha], an undercover Astûrban agent (page 43). As per usual on Coriolis, nothing is what it appears to be.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CONSORTIUM</h5><p>The Consortium dominates Coriolis, and thereby the entire Horizon, through cunningly crafted trade agreements, exploitation and export of natural resources, and gunboat diplomacy, backed by their loyal sister faction the Legion. In The Wake of the Martyr, the Consortium leadership is slow to realize that a scheme is afoot: their main concern is the growing conflict with the Order of the Pariah, and all focus is directed toward trying to solve the problem once and for all. The Taoan debacle and the destruction of the Ghazali in the Hamura system appears to be the perfect excuse for showing the Order who is really in charge. The faction is too busy with interstellar power games to spend adequate resources on finding out what actually happened. Their political tunnel vision has made them blind to the larger danger, which eventually gives them and their allies an uncomfortable surprise. Contact with the Consortium in this scenario happens mainly through Judge @Actor[Nigelia Kurahan-dol-Fahsra] (page 41).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NAZAREEM’S SACRIFICE</h5><p>In this scenario, the Astûrban are pulling most of the strings by using the Warriors of the Holy Light and the Order to weaken the Consortium and level the field for the hegemonists to rise to power. Later in the Mercy of the Icons campaign, however, the Astûrban and several other factions will turn out to have been infiltrated and manipulated by Third Horizon agents from Nazareem’s Sacrifice all along.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE EMISSARIES</h5><p>The Emissary on Coriolis is one of five mystics from the Symmetry, a faction in the Second Horizon. The spirit of the mystic inhabits the body of the Miran prospector Alam Dania, who participated in the Foundation’s attempts to send a team of scientists to Xene to obtain sensor data from the depths of the gas giant. The Emissaries are powerful mystics, residing in human bodies. They have the power to stop aging, and even to force cell regrowth, but this is a slow process. If their host bodies become too damaged, the mind will have nothing to hold onto. The Emissaries' host bodies require little to no maintenance – virtually no nutrition is needed and no waste is produced. This means that the Emissary on Coriolis really only uses one of the rooms in the residence, the lounge. Nothing of this is known by anyone in the Third Horizon, and therefore not by the PCs nor the players either. As the GM however, you can use this knowledge to portray the Emissary as a mystical being that doesn’t appear to function like a normal human.</p><p>What is known about the Emissaries, however, is that the individual who remains on the Foundation’s Xene research station has declared itself to be an incarnation of the Judge Icon, or Hukim-mu-Qad. News of the arrival of the Emissaries to the Third Horizon and the rumors linking them to the Icons have therefore resulted in pilgrims and mystics increasingly referring to the Emissary on Coriolis as Nabi-mu-Qad, or just Nabi – the Messenger. As the GM, you can use this expression when the PCs interact with mystics or very pious believers. The Zenithian factions use only the official title “Emissary” and the Order refuses to acknowledge them as anything more than the heretical monstrosities they claim them to be.</p><h4>BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h4><p>The <em>Wake of the Martyr</em> is at its core a story about investigating a mystery. The PCs are tasked with finding out who is murdering and kidnapping mystics on Coriolis and will spend most of the scenario chasing down leads they believe will bring them closer to the truth. At the heart of the scenario are the questions of what part the mystics are playing in the drama of the Third Horizon, and who is responsible for the crimes committed against them, but this is also a story about the Coriolis station and the society found there. Each act is focused on one part of the station: Act 1 (The Mysticides) takes place mainly in the mid-levels of the station, with their residential complexes, entertainment districts, and offices. Act 2 (High Stakes) brings the PCs up into the Spire to see the affluence and naked ambition of the station’s elite. And, finally, Act 3 (The Abyss) is a nightmarish descent into the underworld of the semi-abandoned Cellar, the dark underbelly of Coriolis, called home by only the poorest of the poor and the most desperate.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>PC INCENTIVES</h5><p>There are many possible ways to involve the PCs in the plot of this scenario. They might have a relative or protegé on Coriolis that has vanished, whom they know was affected by the strange mystic’s disease. They could also have been hired by their patron or someone they have worked for in the past. The opening scene, The Attack, described below, can also be used. If the group have played through the The Last Voyage of the Ghazali, the missing Khomina character can be used as well.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  TIMELINE</h5><p>As the GM, you are free to place The Wake of the Martyr and the following suite of scenarios anywhere along the timeline of the Third Horizon, as long as the mystics have started to appear and the Emissary on Coriolis has taken its seat on the Council. However, below is the official timeline leading up to the disappearance of the Emissary:</p><ul><li><strong>The Ghosts from Xene</strong>: CC60, during the segment of the Traveler. The Emissaries arrive in the Kua system.</li><li><strong>The Judge</strong>: During the celebration of the Cyclade, breaking news from the Bulletin reports that an Emissary onboard the Foundation’s Xene research station has declared itself the Judge incarnate.</li><li><strong>The Messenger</strong>: The next day – the first day of the new year – one of the Emissaries arrives at Coriolis onboard a Foundation cruiser escorted by two Legion battleships. The Governor of Coriolis makes an official statement inviting the Emissary to the Council of Factions.</li><li><strong>The Mystic’s Disease</strong>: Since the Emissaries' arrival on Xene, people all across the Horizon have begun developing strange powers, leading to accidents, fear, hate, and persecution. Many mystics have flocked to Coriolis for protection, and to be close to the Messenger Emissary. A smaller group also gather at the Xene station to be close to the Judge Emissary.</li><li><strong>The Ghazali Incident</strong>: After a distress signal is picked up from a mining colony owned by the Colonial Agency in the segment of the Gambler, CC61, a rescue mission consisting of the enormous cruise liner Ghazali and Legion cruiser Zafirah is launched for the Taoan system. Zafirah disappears and Ghazali is destroyed under mysterious circumstances while traveling through the Hamura system.</li><li><strong>The Mysticides</strong>: As CC61 nears its end, mystics begin disappearing all over Coriolis, and some are later found murdered. The Cyclade and the festivities marking the new year are just a week or so away. When the Emissary also goes missing, it might prove to be the spark that lights the flame.</li></ul><p>A good place to begin <em>The Wake of the Martyr</em> would be in the segment of the Faceless One, nine days before the Cyclade. When the Emissary goes missing, judge Kurahan takes action to try to solve the mystery before the new year and the anniversary of the Emissary’s arrival to Coriolis. If the matter is not taken care of quickly, a major political disaster will be almost impossible to avoid.</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>PREPARATIONS</h4><p>For a really good session playing The Wake of the Martyr, we recommend some measure of preparation. You should have read the scenario in its entirety at least once. Regardless of whether this is the first scenario you play with your group or if you are already seasoned adventurers in the Horizon, it is always good for you as the GM to spend some time getting the PCs' entrance right. Think of the PCs' different qualities and backgrounds to determine a suitable kind of entrance, both for individual characters and for the group as a whole. The group concept can be very helpful here.</p><p>Lastly, we wish to warn you that investigation stories can be a tough affair for you as the GM. Players have an annoying tendency to overlook even the most obvious of clues, and there is nothing more boring than a murder mystery that has hit a wall. Help them by making sure they organize the clues they find and remind them of things that a player might forget, but that her PC wouldn’t. If they get stuck, use one of the events to get them back on track. If things are going really poorly, use one of the major NPCs to give the group a push in the right direction. The correspondent Jeyla Kuhari, Ahuro of the Guard, and judicator Akouba can serve as excellent sources for tips and leads for example.</p></div><br /><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/01-IN1a-Martyrkommandot.webp\" /></div><p></p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"8qKeQRJi2BmDw2A2","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297502,"modifiedTime":1682695297502,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"lOmgwpk3arLr3JlN","sort":0,"_id":"aGSixqlegsHNpRER"}

The stories vary from system to system, and from Firstcome to Zenithian. Spirits, just like darkmorphs, are manifestations of the Dark between the Stars, formed from channeled lost hopes, dark thoughts, and that which happens in the emptiness of a portal jump. Spirits and sarcofagoi share the trait that they are ethereal beings and as such immune to certain forms of physical violence. They are often just as intelligent as humans, and can be both manipulated and tricked. Just like darkmorphs, spirits have the ability to channel the darkness to fuel their abilities through Darkness Points. The GM can choose to spend DP to activate an ability. The cost depends on the ability.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>NO SPIRITS?</h5><p>Spirits are a part of the story in Coriolis – The Third Horizon, but if you and your group feel that it would be weird or too supernatural to chitchat with an efrite in the catacombs underneath a Portal pyramid or to be possessed by a Hazared, then maybe they are just that – stories.</p></div><div class=\"blueheader\">DJINN</div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\">Culture Test: <strong>-1</strong></div><p>The djinn are spirits that exist in the Dark between the Stars. They are ethereal but can take physical form whenever they wish.

Djinn come in many forms, but are often only visible as a gust of wind or a swirl in the desert sands. They can choose to present themselves as either human or animal, but they are very much just like people: some of them are good, some are evil, and a few are just neutral. Djinn can sometimes play tricks on humans, but just as easily destroy them. There are many different magnitudes of djinn, from the djanna, the weak jungle sprites, to the mighty efrites.

They have no known family members, and generally very few close loved ones. For the past Coriolis Cycle they have been installing probes and monitoring sensor readouts from the gas giant itself, work connected to the secret project known as the <em>Jarouma Pattern</em>.</p><h4>THE PATTERN</h4><p>On the ninth day of the segment of The Traveler, the installation will go online. It’s purpose is to change the fluctuating magnetic field and electromagnetic patterns of the gas giant Xene. Two Coriolis Cycles ago, CC58, Jarouma Had Peleter discovered that the artifact around Izar emitted an energy pattern only previously seen in the fields forming and collapsing around stars – the patterns used to calculate portal jumps.</p><p>Although the pattern at Izar was similar, it could not form an actual portal field. This had the researchers confounded for two cycles. The clue that would unlock the riddle came from old data logs from a weather station in Xene’s atmosphere – another pattern, almost identical with Jarouma’s discovery at Izar, had formed at the same time.</p><h4>THE INSTALLATION</h4><p>Foundation Station 7 and the nearby mining facilities are protected by a company of legionnaires known as the Chau’kedaar – the Watchers. After the Jarouma Pattern was discovered on Xene as well, researchers at FS-7 began installing a grid of stabilizers in the atmosphere. The placement of the nodes has been based on the cage-like structure of the Web of Izar, and once activated, they should be able to adjust the fluctuations to match. Jarouma’s theory is that identical patterns might form a bridge between the two planets, and create a new form of portal. At the scenario’s start, it’s the eighth day of the segment of The Traveler, and the installation is almost ready to be activated.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">FACTS ABOUT XENE</div><p>At 18 AU from Kua’s star and 13 AU from Coriolis, Xene is situated just outside of the system’s main space. The inner asteroid belt forms a line between the colonized inner planets and the more industrialized outer system. Xene doesn’t have much commercial traffic, with the exception of the Consortium’s mining operations, some independent prospectors, and research projects run by the Foundation. It is, however, a vital transfer point and refueling station for ships on their way to the Rimward Reach.</p><ul><li><strong>DIAMETER</strong>: 143,200 km (roughy 11 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>EQUATORIAL CIRCUMFERENCE</strong>: 449,648 km (roughly 11 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>SURFACE AREA</strong>: 64 billion square kilometers (roughly 128 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>GRAVITY</strong>: 2.15 standard gravity</li><li><strong>DAY LENGTH</strong>: 9.5 hours</li><li><strong>SIDEREAL YEAR</strong>: 11 Kuan years</li><li><strong>AXIAL TILT</strong>: 86 degrees</li><li><strong>MOONS</strong>: 6 major (diameter larger than 50 kilometers), 23 minor.<br /><strong>Santir</strong> - mining installation | Ninda - surveyed | Calest - mining installation | Aish - stripped bare, mining rigs disabled | Onid - prospecting for future operations | Eod - neutral mining operations, prospector base Kalder’s Dream</li></ul><h4>SCENARIO ACTORS</h4><p>This is a closed-environment scenario with only a few characters who are restricted to a locked down section of the FS-7 station, and later to the atmospheric shuttle they will use to enter Xene’s atmosphere.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STATION CREW</h5><p>FS-7 holds about 500 researchers, technicians, prospectors, and office staff, all under the watchful care of station commander Tariek Sidonna. The entire perimeter is protected by a company of 85 legionnaires, with ten fighter ships on standby, two atmospheric shuttles, and about 50 combat-ready soldiers positioned at the various Consortium rigs on Xene’s moons. This leaves 25 soldiers on FS-7, all led by the hardened and loyal veteran Tehira Markoon. Jarouma has her main research labs on Kua and Coriolis, and will only visit the station during crucial milestones. Her research assistant never leaves her side.</p><ul><li><strong>Tehira Markoon (Algol)</strong> – Legion captain (Firstcome)</li><li><strong>Tariek Sidonna (Kua)</strong> – Station commander for FS-7 (Zenithian)</li><li><strong>Jarouma Had Peleter (Kua)</strong> – Chief scientist (Zenithian)</li><li><strong>Frendi Kurahan (Coriolis)</strong> – Research assistant (Zenithian)</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESEARCHERS</h5><p>The crew is quarantined in section 31 of the station, separated from other research groups. They have their own quarters, a research and tech lab, a drone launch bay, as well as their own dock and airlock for visiting ships. There is no hangar bay, and any ship needs to be requisitioned for use by the team.</p><ul><li><strong>Faisal Kham (Kua)</strong> – Scientist, team leader (Zenithian)</li><li><strong>Leila Hatami (Dabaran)</strong> – Pilot (Zenithian)</li><li><strong>Yorûg om-Khalit (Altai)</strong> – Analyst (Mogul Firstcome)</li><li><strong>Alam Dania (Mira)</strong> – Technician (Firstcome)</li><li><strong>Harish Verma (Mira)</strong> – Archaeologist (Firstcome)</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  PLAYER CHARACTERS AND NPCS</h5><p>A Song for Jarouma primarily focuses on the interaction between the five researchers. Each character is written as a playable role, but the amount of players in the group don’t have to match this number. Any remaining roles will instead be played by the gamemaster as non-player characters (NPCs). Since the scenario’s core are the interactions within the research team, it’s important that each player reads through her character’s stats, personal problems, secrets, and goal carefully. These may contradict other character descriptions, a deliberate element of the scenario to create tension within the group.</p><p>For ease of reference, each skill on the character descriptions has its attribute defined. For example, “Dexterity [A] 2” means that rolling for dexterity allows for two dice, plus whatever the character has in Agility.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Faisal Kham]</li><li>@Actor[Leila Hatami]</li><li>@Actor[Yorûg Om-Khalit]</li><li>@Actor[Alam Dania]</li><li>@Actor[Herish Verma]</li><li>@Actor[Jarouma Had Peleter]</li></ul><h4>BECOMING AN EMISSARY</h4><p>The beings later known as the Emissaries are powerful mystics from the Second Horizon who transcended space and let their minds take over bodies in the Third Horizon. When this happens, the victim will first see flashes of darkness, and hear whispers in their ears. These whispers become words of reassurance, as if someone is comforting or soothing the pain or stress of the character. The Emissary who is about to enter can then partially control, or suggest actions, to its victim. The mind feels tired, gradually developing tunnel vision, beginning with the peripheral view, then gradually eating up more space until only a pinprick of light remains. The character hears static, picking up the rushing of blood in their own head. Letting go, being knocked out, killed, or in any other way losing consciousness or control will allow the Emissary to fully enter the victim (see page 225 for the final scene @JournalEntry[01 - Descent to Xene]).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>SECRETS AND LIES</h5><p>All playable characters have secrets. To add some interconnections between the characters, each player can decide one secret, or part of a secret, that some other character in the group knows about. Also decide if the character whose secret is known is aware that someone else knows.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>PLAYING AN EMISSARY</h4><p>Once taken over, you can let your players continue playing as an Emissary for the remainder of the final scene. The character is calm, controlled, and soothing – never angry or violent, even if attacked. It’s highest wish is to ease everyone’s pain. To help, and give them a higher purpose. Any wounds they suffer heal almost instantly, and the Emissary cannot be affected by stress. It will try to comfort and convince any other members of the crew to let go – that everything will be wonderful, and that they will finally rest, bathing in the love and light of the Icons.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"gSV7jJEoZTNpIXT2","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296430,"modifiedTime":1682695296430,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mMIaH3Q1FeIxhyQM","sort":0,"_id":"awYxoVxq0Q8figWb"}

The long distances in the Dark between the Stars are usually just monotonous and claustrophobic. However, the time may come when you are met with hostility and must defend yourselves. This section deals with space combat, and describes how to play out a violent encounter in the void.</h3><h4>SCALE</h4><p>The system described below is designed to manage combat between only a few ships per side – the most common combat encounter is a one-on-one ship duel. Large battles between whole armadas are a part of the history of the Third Horizon, but are very rare nowadays.</p><h4>CREW POSITIONS</h4><p>All spaceships have specific crew positions that must be covered. Small vessels can be constructed so that the same person can perform several function at once, while large ships may have many crew members per position – more on this below. The five crew positions are:</p><ul><li>Captain</li><li>Engineer</li><li>Pilot</li><li>Sensor Operator</li><li>Gunner</li></ul><p>As soon as you have acquired your spaceship, you should decide within the group who should do what job onboard. When the torpedo alarm warns of imminent attack, everyone must know exactly what they are supposed to do. In the Icon Card Deck, each crew position has a corresponding crew card detailing the actions of that position. The crew cards are not needed to play, but they are helpful.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>GAME AIDS</h5><p>Space combat is a little more complicated than planetside combat. To help you keep track of things, the following game aids can be useful:</p><ul><li><strong>THE SHIP SHEET</strong> – found in the back of the book and can be downloaded from our website.</li><li><strong>THE CREW CARDS</strong> – included in the Icon Card Deck, which is sold separately.</li><li><strong>THE SPACE COMBAT MAP</strong> – found in the back of the book and can be downloaded from our website.</li></ul><p>How to use these aids is described below.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>YOU AND THEM</h4><p>The rules in this chapter are written from the point of view of your PCs and their ship, but they apply for NPCs as well – unless stated otherwise.</p></div><h4>DISTANCE AND SEGMENTS</h4><p>The distances in empty space are huge, too vast for it to be meaningful to keep track of the exact distance between two ships. Instead, the game uses the abstract term Combat Units – CU. One CU can be tens or even hundreds of miles. The combat area is divided into segments. On the space combat map (in the back of the book, and available for download from our website), the space between each horizontal line is one segment. The distance between each segment is one CU. All movement in space combat is handled by moving between the segments on the map. The rules manage movement in space in only one dimension – an abstraction of the three-dimensional movement that is actually taking place.</p><p><strong>Movement</strong>: In space combat, the “terrain” between the combatants is not important – the Dark between the Stars is endless. What matters is the relative distance between the ships. To move one CU towards or away from an enemy ship, test PILOT (more under Crew Positions, below). The movement roll can be modified negatively (-1 or -2) by obstacles in the segment you intend to reach, such as asteroids, space junk or gravity wells.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RANGE</h5><p>Just like in ground combat, the range between you and your enemy is divided into five steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Contact</strong>: 0 CU (the same segment). Ramming and boarding possible.</li><li><strong>Short</strong>: 1 CU (adjacent segment). Visual contact limit.</li><li><strong>Medium</strong>: 2 CU. Passive sensor limit.</li><li><strong>Long</strong>: up to 4 CU. Active sensor limit.</li><li><strong>Extreme</strong>: up to 8 CU. Extreme sensor limit.</li></ul><h4>SENSORS AND SIGNATURE</h4><p>When you approach another spacecraft, the question is who detects the other first. Sometimes, this can determine the outcome of the entire battle. How far away you can detect other spaceships depends on your sensors, and how you use them.</p><p><strong>Passive Sensors</strong>: This is the standard setting on any sensor. The sensor range is Medium (2 CU) and your Signature is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Active Sensors</strong>: The sensors are set to maximum effect. The sensor range is Long (4 CU), but you get +2 to your Signature. The active sensor mode costs 1 EP per turn (see below).</p><p><strong>Extreme Sensors</strong>: If you have the feature Extreme Sensors, your sensor range in active mode is increased to Extreme (8 CU). Otherwise, they work like normal active sensors.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 7.13 SENSORS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>SENSORS</th><th>RANGE</th><th>SIGNATURE</th><th>EP COST</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Passive</td><td>Medium</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Active</td><td>Long</td><td>+2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme</td><td>Extreme</td><td>+2</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 7.14 SHIP DETECTION</h4><table><thead><tr><th>CIRCUMSTANCE</th><th>MODIFIER</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Contact Range</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Short Range</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Medium Range</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Long Range</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme Range</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>No Radio Silence</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Reactor Shut Down</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>Weapons Fire</td><td>Automatic Detection</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TRANSPONDERS</h5><p>All spaceships are required to travel with their transponders switched on – this is both the law and common courtesy. The transponder transmits data about the ship’s position, name, class, home docks and destination. A ship with an active transponder is automatically detected as soon as it enters sensor range.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SILENT RUNNING AND SIGNATURE</h5><p>Traveling with your transponder switched off is regarded with extreme suspicion – only smugglers and military vessels do that. If a ship with its transponder switched off enters your sensor range, it is not automatically detected. The GM will ask your sensor operator to test DATA DJINN. The roll is modified by the Signature of the target (page 162 @JournalEntry[Space Combat]), the distance between the ships and other factors (table 7.14), as well as some ship features.</p><p>The same applies if you are the ones traveling without an active transponder and enter another ship’s sensor range. If both you and the enemy ship are traveling without active transponders, and have the same sensor range, you both roll simultaneously to detect the other when you get close enough.</p><p><strong>Radio Silence</strong>: If the enemy ship does not adhere to radio silence – it is in some way using its off-ship communications – you get a +2 to your detection roll.</p><p><strong>Reactor Shutdown</strong>: A ship that really wants to avoid detection can perform an emergency reactor shutdown. The operation requires a successful technology test by the engineer of the ship. To determine how many minutes the shutdown takes, roll a number of D6 equal to the class of the ship. Only one person at a time may attempt the shutdown, but several attempts can be made.</p><p>With the reactor shut down, the ship is “dead” – you lose all your Energy Points and cannot change course, use weapon systems or active sensors. The artificial gravity onboard is also lost. The reserve batteries power passive sensors, emergency lights and life support systems – but only for a number of days equal to the class of the ship. Restarting the reactor requires another <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">technology</strong> roll. To determine how many hours the restart takes, roll a number of D6 equal to the class of the ship.</p><p><strong>Success</strong>: If your sensor roll is successful, you detect the enemy ship and may now engage with it. Your level of success determines how much information you get (table 7.15). You can of course contact the ship and inquire after more details, but whether or not they reply is up to the captain of that ship. You get to make another sensor roll only when the circumstances change (see below).</p><p><strong>Failure</strong>: If your sensor roll fails, you detect nothing. The GM reveals no information. The sensor operator gets to roll again when the circumstances change in your favor, for example if the enemy ship moves a range step closer to you, makes an active sensor sweep, uses its radio etc.</p><p><strong>Avoiding Contact</strong>: If you detect the enemy ship, but remain undetected yourself, you can choose to change course and avoid contact. If you move a range step closer to the other ship – or takes some other action that makes your Signature more noticeable – its sensor operator will get to make another attempt to detect you.</p><p><strong>Confrontation</strong>: When you have detected an enemy spaceship, you can choose whether or not to attack it. If you in turn also have been detected, roll your initiative scores and place your ships on the ship combat map. If the enemy has not detected you however, you get what is called a free turn – read more below.</p><p>Instead of attacking, you can choose to hail the captain of the other ship using your radio system. This will of course cost you the element of surprise if things turn violent later on.</p><p><strong>Disappearing</strong>: When you have been detected, you will remain on the enemy’s radar screen as long as you stay within their sensor range, unless your ship is equipped with stealth technology (see below) – if it is, your sensor operator can make you disappear from their screens.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 7.14 SHIP DETECTION</h4><table><thead><tr><th>DEGREE OF SUCCESS</th><th>INFORMATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Limited (1-2 sixes)</td><td>Distance in CU, current course</td></tr><tr><td>Critical (3+ sixes)</td><td>Distance, class, course, weapons</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>SPACE COMBAT MAP</h5><p>The space combat map is found in the back of the book, and can be downloaded from the Free League website. Use any markers you like to represent the ships involved in the battle. Please note that the space combat map is used only when two vessels have detected each other and engage in combat. Only then are PILOT rolls needed to move towards or away from the enemy ship. Before both parties have detected each other, the GM only needs to determine the range between the ships.</p></div><h4>TURNS AND INITIATIVE</h4><p>Space combat is divided into turns just like ground combat (Chapter 5), but a turn in space is longer – usually several minutes.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE ICON CARDS</h4><p>You cannot use the Icon deck (page 83 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) to substitute the initiative dice in space combat. You can use the cards to keep track of the turn order, however.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INITIATIVE</h5><p>Initiative scores are determined at the beginning of the fight just like in ground combat, but in space, only the captains of the engaged ships roll. They each make a <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> roll. The highest die each captain rolled will be her ship’s initiative score for the rest of the battle. The scores can be changed during the course of the fight, just like in ground combat.</p><p>In case of a tie, the number of dice showing the highest number determines who goes first – two fives beat one five, for example. A second tie is broken by the highest <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> skill level among the captains. If that still leaves some combatants tied, chance decides who goes first.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/grupp_besättning_1.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TURN PHASES</h5><p>One turn of space combat is divided into five phases – one per crew position. All pilots act in the pilot phase, all engineers in the engineer phase, and so on. The turn order within each phase is determined by the initiative scores of the captains. The five phases are detailed below, but here is a brief overview:</p><ol><li><strong>Order Phase</strong>: All captains choose their orders secretly, and roll command.</li><li><strong>Engineer Phase</strong>: The engineers distribute their ships’ EP, and perform any necessary repairs.</li><li><strong>Pilot Phase</strong>: The pilots maneuver to get either closer to, or farther away from, their enemy ship.</li><li><strong>Sensor Phase</strong>: The sensor operators lock onto targets, break locks on their own ships, and perform data attacks.</li><li><strong>Attack Phase</strong>: The gunners fire their weapon systems, including countermeasures.</li></ol><p>In each combat phase, crew members on a certain position get to perform one action. The available actions are described below. Unlike regular combat, actions in space combat are not divided into slow, normal and fast actions – there is only one kind of action, and you get one action per turn.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>EXAMPLE</h4><p><em>Narzalus is en route to the Djachroum station and has to pass through the Corsair belt. The crew opts to run silent, turns the transponder off to avoid detection and sets their sensors to passive mode. The GM has decided that the corsair vessel Tigris, also silent and with its sensors set to passive mode, is out hunting in the belt as the Narzalus passes by. When the two ships are two CU from each other, their sensor operators both test data djinn to detect the other ship. The GM (the operator onboard the Tigris) gets a ± 0 because of the Medium range, and a +1 because of the Tigris’ sensitive sensors. The roll shows one six, and the Narzalus shows up on the screens. Sahab, the sensor operator on the Narzalus, rolls an unmodified sensor roll, succeeds, and detect the Tigris. Time to take out the space combat map and place the ships two CU from each other. This space combat example continues on page 173.</em></p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>STARTING PLACEMENT</h4><p>When two ships engage in combat with each other, place ship tokens on the space combat map. Make sure to place the tokens the correct distance from each other. Which segments on the map you choose is not important – try to place the ships equally close to the center of the map.</p></div><h5>1. ORDER PHASE</h5><p>During the first phase of the turn, the captains act. The captain’s action is to give orders. A captain cannot force crew members to obey her, but by following the given orders, the other crew members can get positive modifiers later in the turn.</p><ul><li><strong>Repair!</strong> Grants a bonus to ship repairs (Phase 2).</li><li><strong>Evade!</strong> Grants a bonus to evasive maneuvers (Phase 3), and to attempts at breaking an enemy lock-on (Phase 4).</li><li><strong>Retreat!</strong> Grants a bonus to movement away from the enemy ship (Phase 3).</li><li><strong>Attack!</strong> Grants a bonus to movement towards an enemy ship (Phase 3), and to all attacks (Phase 5).</li></ul><p>Giving Orders: The captain chooses her order without showing it to the other captains (usually only the GM). Write down your order on a piece of paper, without showing it to the opposing captain. The other captains do the same, and then you all reveal your orders at the same time.</p><p>When you have revealed your order, and it is your turn to act, test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong>. If you pass, your order gives a positive modifier equal to the number of sixes on your roll. If your ship can perform more than one action of the same kind (for example more than one attack), the modifier applies to all of these actions.</p><p>Your crew are free to follow your order (benefiting from the modifier) or to disregard it (forfeiting the bonus).</p><p><strong>Other Instructions</strong>: Your function as captain is, as far as the rules are concerned, only to give one of the four orders above, but there is nothing stopping you from giving other orders as well – how the engineer should distribute the EP, or which target the gunner should attack, for example. Your crew is then free to obey you (or not) as they see fit.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>GROUND COMBAT AND SPACE COMBAT</h5><p>Ground combat and space combat can happen at the same time. Perhaps a firefight breaks out on your ship while it  is at the same time engaged in space combat. For simplicity, we recommend that you alternate between the two – one turn of space combat, then one turn of ground combat, space combat, ground combat, and so on. You cannot be an active combatant in both fights at the same time. If you are engaged in ground combat in a turn, you cannot participate in the space combat in that same turn.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SURPRISE ATTACK</h4><p>If you attack an enemy ship that has yet to detect you on its screens (see above), your attack counts as a surprise attack. In the first turn of the battle, only you get to act – this is called a free turn. After the first attack, you are automatically detected, and all parties roll initiative scores like you normally would, and the fight continues normally.</p></div><h5>2. ENGINEER PHASE</h5><p>The second phase in the turns belongs to the engineers. Their actions are not chosen secretly – one engineer at a time performs her action, in the established turn order.</p><p><strong>Energy Distribution</strong>: The most important task for the engineer is to distribute the energy from the reactor. The power generated is not enough for all systems all the time, meaning that the engineer must prioritize. In the game, this is represented by Energy Points (EP). Each ship has a pool of EP to spend every turn. If your ship takes damage, the EP pool can decrease – read more under Ship Damage, below. Each turn, the engineer distributes the entire EP pool to the other crew members. To keep track of EP, you can use any token you like, and place them on the respective crew cards (if you have access to the Icon Card Deck). EP pools are refreshed at the beginning of each turn. EP cannot be saved between turns.</p><p>As a rule, all actions in space combat performed by a crew member cost 1 EP, but there are some exceptions:</p><ul><li>Captain’s orders (Phase 1) cost no EP.</li><li>Overloading the reactor (Phase 2) costs no EP.</li><li>The pilot’s actions (Phase 3) cost a number of EP equal to the class of the ship.</li><li>Firing a torpedo (Phase 5) costs no EP.</li></ul><p><strong>Overload</strong>: If a crew member gets additional EP to spend on an action, the action becomes more effective. Each additional EP above the base cost of the action gives a +1 bonus to the roll. Three extra EP means a +3 modifier, for example.</p><p><strong>The Engineer’s Actions</strong>: Distributing EP is no action per se, and requires no dice roll. After the EP have been distributed, the engineer can perform one of the following actions (all demanding technology tests):</p><ul><li><strong>Overloading the Reactor</strong>: A successful roll gives you extra EP equal to the number of sixes on your roll. Distribute the extra EP immediately. The ship suffers 1 point of HP damage per extra EP generated. A failed roll means 1 point of HP damage.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 0 EP.</li><li><strong>Repair Hull Damage</strong>: A successful roll restores Hull Points equal to the number of sixes on your roll. A failed roll has no effect.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP. Requires one Ordinary spare part (page 113 @Item[Spare part, Ordinary]). Without a service station, you get a -2 to the roll.</li><li><strong>Repair System Damage</strong>: A successful roll restores lost EP equal to the number of sixes on your roll, taking effect at the beginning of the next turn. A failed roll has no effect.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP. Requires one Ordinary spare part. Without a service station, you get a -2 to the roll.</li><li><strong>Repair Critical Damage</strong>: A successful roll repairs one critical damage, provided the ship has not been vaporized. A failed roll has no effect.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP. Requires one Ordinary spare part. Without a service station, you get a -2 to the roll.</li><li><strong>Repair Module</strong>: A successful roll restores a disabled module to working condition. A failed roll has no effect.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP. Requires one ordinary spare part (page 113 @Item[Spare part, Ordinary]). Without a service station, you get a -2 to the roll.</li><li><strong>Open an airlock</strong> to an enemy ship that the pilot has docked with in the previous turn. See Boarding (phase 3), below.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP.</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/mira_skeppet.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>NPCS AND EPS</h4><p>The GM distributes EP to his ships just like the players do. If you have the Icon Card Deck, use the GM crew card – it holds up to four ships.</p></div><h5>3. PILOT PHASE</h5><p>The pilots all act in the third phase. This phase in played openly, just like Phase 2. The pilots act one by one, in the established turn order. The pilot can perform a variety of maneuvers, each one requiring a <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">pilot</strong> test. Each maneuver is modified by the Maneuverability of the ship (page 141 @JournalEntry[Spacecraft in the Third Horizon]). A failed roll means that the intended maneuver is not performed. Unlike other crew members, the pilot can perform multiple actions at once – if she has been allotted enough EP. Each additional action after the first one gives a -2 to all actions. The pilot chooses the order of her actions. These are the available actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Position</strong>: The pilot attempts to move into a better position. Each six on the roll raises the initiative score of the ship by one for the coming turns.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: EP equal to the class of the ship.</li><li><strong>Advance/Retreat</strong>: The ship moves one segment on the map in the direction of your choice. For each additional six on the roll, you can move one extra segment.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: EP equal to the class of the ship.</li><li><strong>Evasive Maneuver</strong>: An unexpected maneuver that gives a penalty to all attacks against the ship for the rest of the turn, equal to the number of sixes on the roll.<br /><strong>cost</strong>:  EP equal to the class of the ship.</li><li><strong>Ramming</strong>: If the ship is in the same segment as an enemy ship (Contact Range), the pilot may attempt to ram the enemy. The action is an opposed pilot roll for the two pilots. It counts as an action for the attacker, but not for the defender. Both rolls are modified by the Maneuverability of the ships. Read more about ramming on page 171 @JournalEntry[Space Combat].<br /><strong>cost</strong>:  EP equal to the class of the ship.</li><li><strong>Boarding</strong>: If the ship is equipped with a docking station, the pilot may attempt to dock with an enemy ship to send a boarding party over. Just like ramming, this is an opposed pilot roll modified by Maneuverability. The attacking pilot suffers a -2 however, as docking during combat is incredibly difficult. If you win the roll, the engineer may (in the next turn) test technology to open an airlock into the enemy ship. Once the docking is complete, the target ship cannot Retreat from  the attacker.<br /><strong>cost</strong>:  EP equal to the class of the ship.</li></ul><h5>4. SENSOR PHASE</h5><p>The sensor operators act in Phase 4 – openly, just like Phases 2 and 3. One operator at a time performs her action, in the established turn order. The sensor operator can perform one of several key actions during a fight, all requiring <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">data djinn</strong> rolls.</p><ul><li><strong>Target Lock</strong>: To attack the enemy effectively, the sensor operator should attempt to lock the targeting computers on the enemy craft. The roll is modified by the Signature of the enemy ship. A successful roll means that the target is now locked, giving a positive modifier to attacks against this target equal to the number of sixes on the roll. Note the lock strength down or use a die to indicate it. Torpedoes cannot be used at all without first locking the target. Other weapon systems can be used without a lock, but suffer a -2 modifier. Only one target at a time may be locked – if you establish a new lock, the previous lock is lost.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP.</li><li><strong>Breaking Target Lock</strong>: To avoid attacks, the sensor operator may attempt to break an enemy lock on the ship. The is modified negatively by the strength of the enemy lock. A successful roll breaks the lock.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP.</li><li><strong>Pulse and Meme Attacks</strong>: The operator launches a data pulse or meme attack against the opponent. The roll is modified by the enemy’s Signature. Pulse attacks deals EP damage (not HP damage). Read more about meme attacks on page 149 @JournalEntry[Space Combat] .<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP.</li><li><strong>Disappear</strong>: If the ship is fitted with Stealth Technology (page 154 @Item[Stealth Technology]), the sensor operator may attempt to drop from the enemies’ screens. If the ship has a lock on it, the roll is modified negatively by the strength of the lock (the highest value in the case of multiple locks). A successful roll ends the combat. The enemy ship may of course try to detect you again.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP.</li></ul><h5>5. ATTACK PHASE</h5><p>In the last phase, the gunners get to act. Their actions are declared openly, as in Phases 2-4. One gunner acts at a time, in the established turn order (with a few exceptions, see below). The gunner fires the ship’s weapon systems. If there are more than one weapon systems onboard, the gunner must choose which system to fire. The attack roll is a <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> test.<br />-** Fire Weapon System**: The attack is modified by the bonus of the weapon system, certain features (above), and by the strength of the lock on the enemy ship. Firing without a target lock gives the gunner a -2 to the roll. Incoming torpedoes may also be targeted. On a successful roll, the target suffers damage (below).<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP.</p><ul><li><strong>Launch a Torpedo</strong>: Like the action above, but requires a lock on the target. Torpedoes don’t hit their targets immediately – they approach them at a speed of 2 CU per turn, including the turn they were launched. Use a token of some sort to represent the torpedo on the combat map. Torpedoes can be fired upon and destroyed by the defender. A ship can carry only a limited number of torpedoes.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: None, but extra EP may be spent for a bonus.</li><li><strong>Defensive Fire</strong>: A ship equipped with an autocannon or a countermeasure dispenser can fire defensive fire against an incoming torpedo, even if the torpedo is launched from 2 CU or less (and thus strikes in the same turn). The defensive fire is rolled for right before the torpedo strikes, and is considered to occur att Contact range. The defensive fire replaces any offensive fire by the gunner in the same turn. Thus, a gunner on a ship acting early in the turn order will need to hold off on  firing offensively, if she wants to retain the option of defensive fire later in the turn. If the ship has multiple gunners (and weapon systems), if can fire offensively and defensively in the same turn. The defensive fire roll is modified by the strength of the enemy’s target lock. A successful defensive fire roll means that the torpedo is destroyed or misses its target.<br /><strong>cost</strong>: 1 EP.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SMALL CREWS</h5><p>On smaller ships, designed for fewer than five crew members, the crew positions are changed:</p><ul><li><strong>Four (class II)</strong>: The pilot takes on the captain’s role as well. In phase one, the pilot rolls the initiative score, but is unable to give orders that carry positive modifiers.</li><li><strong>Three (class II)</strong>: The engineer takes on the sensor operator’s role as well. The data djinn and technology rolls are rolled normally. The engineer simply gets two actions per turn.</li><li><strong>Two (class I and II)</strong>: The pilot takes on the gunner’s role as well. The ranged combat attack rolls are unmodified. The pilot simply gets two actions per turn.</li><li><strong>One (class I)</strong>: The pilot covers all crew positions, getting four actions per turn.</li></ul><p>All of the changes above stack – on a ship crewed by three people, the pilot also acts as captain, and the engineer acts as sensor operator.</p><p><strong>Lost Crew</strong>: The above only applies to ships designed purposefully for the specified number of crew members. If a ship designed for a larger crew loses some members, the roles are still combined as above, but for every extra action a crew member performs, she gets a -2 to all her actions. Everyone onboard must declare at the beginning of the turn in which phases she intends to act. The initiative roll is not an action. A single person could try to manage a ship designed for a crew of five, but if she wants to act in every phase, all her actions carry a -8 modifier.</p><p><strong>Ship Systems</strong>: A ship with the features Ship System or Ship Intelligence can have these features cover some positions. Read more on page 154 @Item[Ship System].</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LARGE CREWS</h5><p>Large ships may have more than five crew members. There can only be one captain, but you may have more than one of the other positions.</p><p><strong>Pilot</strong>: Only one person maneuvers the ship in combat, but a co-pilot can take over when necessary.</p><p><strong>Engineer</strong>: Only the head engineer gets to distribute the EP, but all engineers get an action during Phase 2. Each individual action may only be attempted once per turn, however. Extra engineers can also help (page 58 @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]) each other with an action.</p><p><strong>Sensor Operator</strong>: Extra operators can be used to get more actions in the sensor phase. Each individual action may only be attempted once per turn. Extra operators can help each other with an action.</p><p><strong>Gunner</strong>: Ships armed with multiple weapon systems may use more than one gunner to make extra attacks. Each gunner gets one attack. Two gunners may not use the same system. Remember that only one target may be locked at once – if the gunners wish to fire at multiple targets, all but one of them must fire without the guidance of a target lock (at -2).</p><h4>SHIP DAMAGE</h4><p>Spaceships take damage just like people, but the scale is different. Ships can suffer two kinds of damage: hull damage and systems damage. Hull damage decreases the ship’s Hull Points (HP), which are a measure of how big and robust the ship is. Systems damage decreases the ship’s Energy points (EP), which are a measure of the reactor’s output. EP are used to power the different systems of the ship, as described above. When a ship suffers EP damage, its effectiveness drops. Systems damage first eliminates EP not already spent in the turn, and after that destroys EP already used.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>DAMAGE TO CREW</h5><p>If the bridge, or some other module where crew members or passengers are located, is destroyed, its occupants risk grave injury. The attacker rolls six dice for each person in the module. The roll works like a normal ranged attack, but skill level and weapon bonus are ignored. Use the weapon system’s weapon damage and CRIT value (the scale of the damage is of course off, but the person is not hit with full force).</p><p>Torpedoes explode when they hit their target, causing more shrapnel damage than other weapons. On a torpedo hit, roll nine dice against each person in the module. On top of the risk of being killed in the blast, the destroyed module also suffers explosive decompression (page 99 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  HULL DAMAGE</h5><p>When a ship is hit by an enemy weapon system, it suffers damage just like people do in ground combat: One six on the roll inflicts hull damage equal to the weapon’s Weapon Damage. Some weapon systems inflict EP damage instead of HP damage, and some systems inflict both HP and EP damage. For each additional six after the first one on the gunner’s attack roll, she gets to choose a bonus effect:</p><ul><li><strong>More Damage</strong>: The target takes one additional point of damage. This effect may be chosen multiple times.</li><li><strong>Critical Hit</strong>: The target suffers a critical hit. This costs a number of sixes after the first one equal to the weapon system’s CRIT rating (page 150). If even more sixes are rolled, the severity of the critical damage may be increased. More on critical damage below.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SHIP RAMMING</h4><p>When one ship rams another (see the pilot phase, above), both ships suffer damage – each ship takes damage equal to the class of the enemy ship. The defender then suffers extra HP damage equal to the number of extra sixes on the attacker’s roll (after the sixes necessary to win the opposed roll).</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARMOR</h5><p>The armor of a spaceship works exactly like body armor in ground combat. If you take a hit, roll a number of dice equal to your Armor Rating – for each six you roll, lower the damage by one. This roll is not an action for any crew member.</p><p><strong>Critical Damage</strong>: If the armor roll reduces the damage suffered to zero, any critical damage is also eliminated. The attacker must declare whether or not she intends to score a critical hit before the armor roll is made.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DISABLED SHIP</h5><p>When a ship drops to either zero HP or zero EP, it is disabled.</p><p><strong>Hull Collapse</strong>: On a ship reduced to zero HP, the reactor and all weapon systems stop working, and the ship also suffers explosive decompression – time to get to the escape pods or into an exo! Read more on page 99 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]. A disabled ship is not blown to bits, however – it can be repaired using the right equipment.</p><p><strong>Systems Collapse</strong>: On a ship reduced to zero EP, the reactor stops working. The life support systems will keep functioning, but no system that requires EP can be used. The ship is dead in space, continuing on its present course with its present speed, and will be lost in the darkness unless towed to safety or repaired.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL DAMAGE</h5><p>Critical damage will seriously affect some of the core functions of the ship. Roll 2D6 to determine the effect.</p><p><strong>Severity</strong>: If you have more sixes to spend than those which you need to score a critical injury, you can use them to increase the severity of the injury. For every extra six spent to increase the severity of the critical injury, you get to reroll the 2D6 crit roll once. You need to determine how many sixes you want to spend on this before you start rerolling. You are allowed to go back to an earlier result if you reroll.</p><p><strong>Cumulative Effects</strong>: All effects from critical damage that modify skill tests stack – if the ship suffers the same critical damage again, add the modifiers.</p><p><strong>Destroyed Modules</strong>: Modules destroyed by a critical hit can be repaired by the engineer. The feature Ship System can also repair destroyed modules.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 7.16 Critical Ship Damage</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 7.16 Critical Ship Damage]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2D6</th><th>CRITICAL DAMAGE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>LIMITED DECOMPRESSION. The integrity of the bridge or some other populated module is breached, venting oxygen into space. Roll a die at the beginning of each following turn – on a six, the module suffers complete explosive decompression (page 99 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). The engineer can repair the breach in the engineer phase.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>STRUCTURAL DAMAGE. The Armor Rating of the ship is reduced by 2, and Signature is increased by 2 until the damage is repaired.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>DAMAGED SENSORS. The sensor operator gets a -2 to all her rolls until the damage is repaired.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>DAMAGED THRUSTERS. The ship becomes harder to control. Maneuverability is decreased by 2.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DAMAGED POWER COUPLING. The power flow from the reactor to the rest of the ship is reduced. The ship’s EP pool is decreased by 2.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>DESTROYED MODULE. A random module is destroyed – it cannot be used until the damage is repaired. Use dice to randomly determine which module is affected. The three required modules bridge, reactor and graviton projector cannot be hit (they have their own critical damage rules). If the module is populated, its occupants risk injury (see the box on the previous page).</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>DISABLED WEAPON SYSTEM. One of the weapon systems on the ship is hit and stops working. If you have more than one weapon system, determine which is hit randomly. If the ship has no weapons at all, reroll this result.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>DISABLED GRAVITON PROJECTOR. The ship loses its propulsion. It continues forward at a constant speed. The pilot can no longer perform any actions.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>DESTROYED BRIDGE. The ship can no longer be maneuvered. The captain, pilot and sensor operator can no longer perform their actions. The engineer and gunner stations are normally not on the bridge, so they can act normally. Everyone on the bridge risks damage, and the module suffers explosive decompression.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>CHAIN REACTION. Roll twice on the table.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>REACTOR DETONATION. A critical hit in the reactor is the worst possible outcome. Reactors in the Third Horizon generate enormous amounts of energy, and a critical hit in the reactor releases all this energy at once. The effect is disastrous – the ship is broken apart and lost forever. Everyone onboard risks serious damage (see the boxed text), and are of course subjected to immediate explosive decompression.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SHIP REPAIRS</h5><p>Repairing a damaged ship requires <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">technology</strong> rolls, tools and spare parts. Read more under the engineer phase on page 168 @JournalEntry[Space Combat]. Ships are usually made up of Ordinary technology, and can therefore be repaired using Ordinary spare parts (page 113 @Item[Spare part, Ordinary]). Some modules and features are Advanced tech however, requiring Advanced parts. Repairs are easier to perform while in dock or in a space port. Repairs during travel or combat suffer a -2 to the roll, unless the ship has a service station.</p><p><strong>Disabled Ship</strong>: A ship that has been disabled from either zero HP or zero EP requires more extensive and time-consuming repairs. For every HP or EP you want to restore to the ship, you must spend a whole day on repairs.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch7/serviceplattf_kua_nätet_rymdskepp.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"IXqTGJSOZW36ZqTG","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266215,"modifiedTime":1680784899630,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"nRFV3m3MEAgKsrne","sort":0,"_id":"bN2ME1Lhss6XHNq1"}

Captain Abarren Quassar together with the Cabinet of Thousands from the Monolith officially rules the faction, but a divide has been growing within the organization. De facto, there are two factions within the Hegemony: the Hegemonists and the neo-Zenithians, the former led by the Quassar family and the latter by Arianites. Both groups share the view that the Hegemony is the rightful ruler of the Third Horizon and destined to lead its peoples to greatness, but they disagree on how to get there. The Hegemonists are elitist and unforgiving, while the neo-Zenithians prefer cooperation, mainly with the Consortium, but also with other factions. Both groups act as patrons for middle class Zenithians through scholarships, as mentors for entrepreneurs, and invest heavily in Zenithian projects, industrial as well as research.<br />The two groups both control a few key institutions within the faction each. The Hegemonists control the infamous secret police, the Astûrban, while the neo-Zenithians founded the Judicators and dominate the mighty fleet. The two police forces aside, the different families keep house guards of their own.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE PRIDE OF ZENITH</h5><p>The fleet of the Zenithian Hegemony is neither the biggest nor the most powerful in the Horizon, but when it comes down to quality, it might be the best. The Zenith Aviation Academy in the Monolith is generally considered the best in the Horizon, and a long line of popular holo dramas has elevated the academy to a legendary reputation. The Sky City in the Monolith also houses elements of the Salakhad flotilla, known as the best corsair hunters in system with their elite Nighthawk squadron. Just recently, the patrol routes of the flotilla have been extended and some ships have been tasked with hunting Syndicate smugglers. The Arianites family is believed to control the fleet, but this has not been proven.</p><p>The Hegemony has many famous members throughout the Horizon apart from Captain Quassar himself and the faction’s council member, Johara Quassar. The duelist Mehot ar-Hrama, a Hegemonist, is notorious for her skills with the mercurium sword and the ritual skafe dagger. From the neo-Zenithians, commander Ehene ar-Eusidia, a Nighthawk squadron fighter ace personally responsible for several corsair kills, is among the best known.</p><p>The Hegemony runs two schools of great reputation, the Aviation Academy in the Monolith and the Judicator’s Forensics Institute on Coriolis. People from all over the Horizon come to the system to apply, but the school rules allow only Zenithians to become students.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>ASTÛRBAN</h5><p>The Astûrban is both secret police and intelligence agency, watching over the Zenithians from their fortress in the Monolith. The name literally means “eye of Astir” – the Astir family want everyone to know the power they hold as founders and supervisors of the organization. What was once the security staff onboard the Zenith has now evolved into one of the most competent, and ruthless, intelligence agencies in the Horizon. The Astûrban is very set in the old ways, seeing themselves as protectors of Zenithians everywhere, regardless of whether they support the Hegemony or not. Astûrban agents are no strangers to carrying out raids on rival factions in what they call “self defense”, something the Council have condemned repeatedly.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE FAMILIES</h4><table><thead><tr><th>HEGEMONISTS</th><th>NEO-ZENITHIANS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Quassar</td><td>Arianites</td></tr><tr><td>Din Hrama</td><td>Laskarid</td></tr><tr><td>Konstantinides</td><td>Vanna</td></tr><tr><td>Zenone</td><td>Din Eusidia</td></tr><tr><td>Astir</td><td>Aristides</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BLOOD CULT</h5><p>The bloodlines mean everything in the Hegemony. The ruling class is obsessed with one thing above all others: the preservation of the genetic unity of the survivors from the Zenith. Their worldview is centered on what crew position your family had, and how closely related you are to the original crew. The great philosopher Merkedsar Konstantinides spoke of “the sanctity and perfection of the Zenithian blood” and argued that the Zenithian civilization could only achieve true greatness if they protected their bloodlines from the evil forces that had caused the Third Horizon to fall into darkness. Certain positions are therefore reserved for “pure-bloods” only, and “defiling” one’s family could be grounds for expulsion from the faction.</p><p>The idea of Zenithian supremacy has spawned a stubborn search for proof of earlier Zenithian settlements in the Horizon. Some patriotic historians claim that the second arkship, Nadir, reached the Third Horizon before the Portal Wars and founded a colony. Several expeditions have searched the Horizon for the remains of this mythical settlement.</p><p>The Hegemony controls the Monolith and the surrounding metropolis, the Conglomerate. They have made huge investments in the different districts and factory islands, but leave most of the daily affairs to hired Algolan colonists, who in turn rule the plebeians and slummers with an iron fist. This practice has resulted in the Free League beginning to recruit in the factories and slums, which has led to clashes between the two factions, sometimes involving both house guards and mercenaries.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/ZentisH_fraktion.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"6Y5HEvui6e92gEQU","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266958,"modifiedTime":1680376266958,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"chqnAEFf87OyYasK"}

The factions may be the true rulers on the Horizon, but they cannot run everything themselves and some areas of business are, at least officially, better left to players of more questionable repute. The small players operate on the level between the people and the factions and handle all sorts of things, from far-world trade and fringe bazaars to secret missions, detective work and security details.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE SMALL PLAYERS AND THE GROUP</h5><p>The small players are designed as potential employers for the PCs. They will run smaller missions, have ties to local patrons and sometimes act as envoys for factionaries.</p></div><h4>FREE TRADER MARKETS</h4><p>Markets where free traders and peddlers meet up to do business exist all across the Horizon. Larger companies trade directly with their clients and use faction-run logistics, but this is not an option for smaller groups and crews who instead must find contracts locally in the spaceports they visit. Traditionally, the free trader markets all look the same. Merchants and free traders gather in a square or some other open space, clustering around the often loud and charismatic contract brokers, the khabaras. The khabara will then auction off the different trade missions – tonnage, prices, destinations and delivery times are discussed loudly, and the captains offer their ships to the merchants. The khabara gets a small broker’s fee for each deal closed. The cost of the jobs is settled publicly on the market so that none of the parties can change the deal afterwards without losing their reputation. While the competition between the free traders can be fierce, some captains and ships are famous enough to ask a higher price and still get the job – in return, the merchant has a higher chance of a safe and speedy delivery.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SOUK ALESH</h5><p>Souk Alesh is the free trader market on Coriolis, located in the heart of the Core, and functions as both bazaar and auction house. The large hall is filled with stalls, podiums, crates and all sorts of rubble, and everywhere, khabaras are calling out contracts, some from the station itself, some from the Net and some from Kua below. The open secret about the Souk Alesh is that the Syndicate gangs control the khabaras and that the Guard looks the other way. This has sometimes resulted in the gang feuds spilling over into the market and that captains have been forced to carry extra cargo by the gang controlling their khabara. The higher-ranking Syndicate members try to keep this from happening too often. The equivalent of the Souk Alesh can be found in almost every spaceport and caravan seraglio, usually under the name Souk Eswad.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> “LAST CHANCE” MARKETS</h5><p>Farthest out on the star arms, in the rim systems or around remote sister stars where the trade routes terminate, you will find the so-called “last chance” markets. The two best-known ones are on Eanu and Menkar, and they are also the wildest. No one sets foot there without packing a Vulcan or bringing a bodyguard. Trade missions to and from the edges of civilization can bring huge profit, but unfortunately, not only desperate free traders visit the last chance markets – corsairs, warlords, local tyrants and the like flock to these markets to get supplies or new tech from the core systems, sometimes leading to captains or whole crews being kidnapped. The last chance market on Eanu is located in an open olive grove outside the Yivem spaceport with a clear view of anyone coming and going for just this reason.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 9.4 MERCHANTS AND TRADING COMPANIES</h4><p>Use the table to roll trading partners for the PCs to interact with.</p><p>@RollTable[Table 9.4 Merchants and Trading Companies]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D66</th><th>NAME AND COMPANY</th><th>TRADING IN</th><th>REPUTATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>11-12</td><td>Aldair Jubal, Jubal Exports &amp; Imports</td><td>Spices, drugs, weapons</td><td>No scruples</td></tr><tr><td>13-15</td><td>Abdul Nasr, the Free League</td><td>Technological artifacts</td><td>Good smuggler contacts</td></tr><tr><td>16-21</td><td>Lea Marhoun, Zenithian Trade Alliance</td><td>Antiquities and archaeological findings</td><td>Good customer network</td></tr><tr><td>22-24</td><td>Mukthar Sawalla, Hyperion Logistics</td><td>Bulk hauling</td><td>Syndicate middleman</td></tr><tr><td>25-31</td><td>Jiamina Mafout, Kuan Transports</td><td>Lumber, semi-intelligences, livestock</td><td>Fair trader</td></tr><tr><td>32-34</td><td>Azura Behroz, Karrmerruk Spices</td><td>Spices, grain</td><td>Blunt</td></tr><tr><td>35-36</td><td>Darya din Kouf, Monolith Lux</td><td>Luxuries, art</td><td>Tries to scam everybody</td></tr><tr><td>41-43</td><td>Bahram Karebadja, Algol Exports</td><td>Ore, industrial products</td><td>Alleged drug runner</td></tr><tr><td>44-45</td><td>Hashmari Nifara, Chelebs</td><td>Gravity projectors, hi-tech</td><td>Always looking for fac-tech</td></tr><tr><td>46-52</td><td>Nikodreas Ferhad, Hazeram Trade</td><td>Noble gases, ship tech</td><td>Always masked</td></tr><tr><td>53-54</td><td>Amarata Yelizina, Dari Yeliz Exports</td><td>Wine, luxuries, foods</td><td>Posh</td></tr><tr><td>55-56</td><td>Heliotres din Nestera, Nestera Foods</td><td>Foods, luxuries, medicines</td><td>Contacts in the weapons industry</td></tr><tr><td>61-62</td><td>Mustafar dol-Hrama, MustafarTrade</td><td>Ore, chemicals, hi-tech</td><td>Hegemonist intermediary</td></tr><tr><td>63-64</td><td>Hatima Shamaz, ShamazXport</td><td>Hi-tech</td><td>Artifact smuggler</td></tr><tr><td>65-66</td><td>Chelona Mirou, Xpress</td><td>Metals, minerals, art</td><td>Fast ships</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>FREELANCE AGENCIES</h4><p>For groups of freelancers or agents, jobs will not be as easy to come across as for free traders or mercenaries. The well-paid jobs will most likely be handled by the intelligence agencies that rarely accept external help. Detective work – anything from missing persons to industrial espionage – is generally managed privately and discreetly, and many detective agencies can be found through the infonet. On Coriolis, the best way is to register your business via the Bulletin on the infonet. There are a few larger freelance firms on Coriolis who sometimes hire experts for certain tasks. The largest firm is Under the Lotus, who, despite their name, has nothing to do with the Temple. They specialize in missing persons and suspicions of adultery or other indiscretions, and have a large numbers of lawyers and bureaucrats on retainer to resolve the conflicts that often arise as side effects of the detective work itself.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/marknad_coriolis.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 9.5 FREELANCE AGENCIES</h4><p>The table lists a few examples of freelance agencies doing courier, detective or investigation work.

The world of secrets is of course always in motion, but given the infighting in the Council of Factions and the mounting political tensions in the Horizon, some places are safe bets – the City of Foreigners on the moon of Karrmerruk, Zalos, for example. Spies, company mercenaries, correspondents and freelancers flock to the city in the hopes of finding secrets, precious cargo or valuable contracts. A new hotbed for the intelligence community is the asteroid station Djachroum in the Rimward Reach, Kua, in which the Order of the Pariah have suddenly shown a great deal of interest. The Consortium’s Special Branch also maintains a visible presence here with a high security prison, some Foundation research installations and a Legion base. To the common people, Dabaran is the capital of intrigue, with its lords, dars and emirs locked in a constant and very public dance of espionage, murder and negotiation. Freelancers are in high demand on Dabaran as the royalty can deny any knowledge of them if they are caught.</p><h4>INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES</h4><p>The larger factions have their own intelligence agencies, both internal and external, and most large corporations have counter-espionage departments. The largest and best known, thanks primarily to a series of Bulletin movies, is the Consortium’s Special Branch. They often use freelancers, many of whom are later incorporated into the organization. The Special Branch has spread to almost the entire Horizon and deal in everything from espionage, the securing of resources and assassinations to political blackmail, artifact hunting and sabotage. The runner up is probably the Order’s intelligence service, but not much is known about it, and the Black Lotuses are also rumored to run a spy network.</p><p>Many factions and regimes also have secret police forces, Sadaal and Zalos for example, and the Zenithian Hegemony has the fearsome Astûrban. They are not prone to hiring freelancers, but it happens, if unofficially. The larger companies – the Colonial Agency, the Bulletin, Nestera, Nyala and Celer-Delekta for example – hire freelancers for all sorts of investigative missions.</p><h4>COURIER MISSIONS</h4><p>Sending messages and information across the Horizon is a physical affair that requires a ship since no signals can pass through the portals. The largest player on this market is Ermes Courier, run by the Bulletin, but people with high secrecy demands often choose smaller firms instead, making for a large market for independent courier crews. Courier missions are common in the free trader souks, where a crew can make a good profit running a courier mission alongside regular cargo. As the souks are public places, mercenaries usually escort sensitive information, but this is not very anonymous. Seeing a demand with no supply here, Captain Masomola Kifri started “Kifri’s Courier Bureau” - or just “the Bureau” - a few cycles ago. The Bureau works like a mercenary agency, with full client anonymity. The business is excellent, and their new offices on an artificial island in the Spire are well attended. The Bureau supplies encrypted tags, bags or other larger vessels to secure the secrets of their clients.</p><h4>MERCENARY AGENCIES</h4><p>The mercenary market works similarly to the courier market. Although the Legion is almost the only player here, there are certain jobs they cannot take, because of the risks or nature of the missions. Furthermore, their fleet is used only for Consortium missions, meaning that the market for escorting, corsair hunting or sabotage is completely open to other mercenaries. Hubs like Coriolis, Akhandar-O-Sharif and Tirgonum have big mercenary agencies run privately but on Legion contracts – and probably under the supervision of several intelligence agencies. In offices like these, mercenary groups can sign up and list their ships, resources and expertise – sharpshooting, explosives, data djinn, infiltration or whatever it may be – and the prospective client can anonymously pick the company that seems the best fit for the mission. Contract and negotiation meetings are then set up by the agency.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BLACK SKULL</h5><p>Just off the Ozone Plaza on Coriolis, a modest building decorated in black lotuses and skulls houses the Black Skull. The name and exterior aside, this is not the Legionnaires’ favorite bar, Cranium, but a mercenary agency. The house is dark and quiet – surveillance-proof according to a small plaque above the door. The Black Skull specializes in operations in the Kua system, but have contacts on Algol, Dabaran and Sadaal as well. If needed, the agency can also coordinate ship and shuttle transport for ground companies.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ALKABAR’S ASSISTANCE</h5><p>Near the center of Akhandar-O-Sharif, the firm Alkabar’s Assistance resides in a shiny new ebony and white skyscraper. Elegant panorama windows with views toward the northern dust seas provide a striking setting for the contract signings between the clients and the mercenaries. Alkabar’s is a big name in both ground and space escorting, and can bring in many different companies and ships, led by special assistance coordinators, if necessary. The coordinators are often ex-Legionnaires or soldiers or officers from the larger mercenary groups. Alkabar’s also have offices on Coriolis – in the nicer parts of the Core – and on Mira, Dabaran, Sadaal and Zalos.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 9.6 CONFLICTS</h4><p>Current conflicts in the Third Horizon that could serve as mission destinations for mercenaries.</p><p>@RollTable[Table 9.6 Conflicts]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D66</th><th>CONFLICT</th><th>PARTICIPANTS</th><th>LOCATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>11-12</td><td>The Slum rebellion</td><td>3rd Popular Brigade and Nestera defense forces</td><td>The Conglomerate, Kua</td></tr><tr><td>13-14</td><td>The Jungle war</td><td>Mercenary group Azza and the Legion</td><td>Kua</td></tr><tr><td>15-16</td><td>The Uharan offensive</td><td>Mercenaries and the Legion</td><td>The forest moons of Uharu</td></tr><tr><td>21-22</td><td>Haven</td><td>General Yihanna, the Alkarra army and the Colonial Agency</td><td>Algol</td></tr><tr><td>23-24</td><td>The Marrab cluster</td><td>The nomad swarms and the prospector clans</td><td>Border Space</td></tr><tr><td>25-26</td><td>The Quiet war</td><td>Djachroum and the Consortium/Legion</td><td>Border Space</td></tr><tr><td>31-32</td><td>The War on Heresy</td><td>The Order of the Pariah and the Zalos-B heretics</td><td>Zalos-B</td></tr><tr><td>33-34</td><td>The Bahtrol revolt</td><td>The nomads of Lubau and the Colonial Agency</td><td>Lubau</td></tr><tr><td>35-36</td><td>The Slaver hunt</td><td>The Slavers and the Consortium</td><td>Tanzim, Algol</td></tr><tr><td>41-42</td><td>The Bokor plague</td><td>The Bokor corsairs and mercenaries</td><td>Anaspora</td></tr><tr><td>43-44</td><td>The Hydran uprising</td><td>The Hydra flotilla and the Legion</td><td>The circle of Dabaran</td></tr><tr><td>45-46</td><td>The Water wars</td><td>Countess Evarides and the Pasha of Dar Bhouti</td><td>Dabaran</td></tr><tr><td>51-52</td><td>The Iron conflict</td><td>The Tufsur emirate and the Consortium</td><td>Algebar</td></tr><tr><td>53-54</td><td>The War of Honey</td><td>Sadaalian free skippers and Dziban the Mematurg</td><td>Errais asteroid belt</td></tr><tr><td>55-56</td><td>The marsh conflict</td><td>The swamp nomads and the Iconocrate</td><td>Sadaal</td></tr><tr><td>61-62</td><td>The Fire graves</td><td>Mercenaries and the Legion</td><td>Pyre, Uharu</td></tr><tr><td>63-64</td><td>The Ordana occupation</td><td>The Leopards of Ayyutta and the Ayuin cartel</td><td>The Quadrant of the Pillar</td></tr><tr><td>65-66</td><td>The Corsair crisis</td><td>The Altai corsairs and the Consortium</td><td>The Quadrant of the Pillar</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>TRAVELERS AND SPACE CARAVANS</h4><p>Since the Zenithians opened the Horizon, and especially since the Church of the Icons declared the pilgrimage a sacred rite, travel has multiplied many times over. Both plebeians and lords travel, if under different circumstances. The rich travel onboard Exeter luxury liners or on their own private yachts. The poor can travel the Horizon by working on the ships, or go on the cheap stasis freighters that some of the larger shipping companies run – to still turn a profit, the stasis beds themselves are part of the cargo. Another way is to hitch a ride with nomads, expeditions or caravans.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  OFLIONA’S CARAVAN</h5><p>For almost ten cycles, captain Ofliona of the Flower of Ibsalim has traveled the Temple route between Mira and Dabaran via Aiwaz and Kua. Over the cycles, other ships have formed a convoy around the giant freighter, whose cargo hold has been rebuilt into a large bazaar lined with living modules. In the aft of the ship there are endless corridors of stasis beds. Anyone is welcome to join the caravan as long as there is a free stasis bed. Smaller ships, together called the Star Flowers, help out with logistics within the caravan and protection if needed, but the Icons seem to be watching over the caravan, and corsairs have never tried to attack it. Similar caravans of skippers who have banded together can be found all across the Horizon – the Rimward Reach nomads, the Birbadir trio and the Aiwaz star sailors on the Sadaal route to name a few. The Pilgrim is a repurposed heavy freighter on loan to the Church of the Icons that help pilgrims travel nonstop between Kua and Mira.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  MARMARA’S FLYING CIRCUS</h5><p>Several entertainment groups have begun traveling the Horizon over the last few cycles. They are courtesan ships, circuses, theater troupes or artists and they all share the routes between the core systems, landing in ports, markets and bazaars, especially during festivals. Marmara’s Flying Circus is one such group, traveling between Coriolis, Kua, Lubau and the outer colonies in the system. The par-Noftim family, headed by the matriarch Yevina Noftima, commands the circus, which is made up of a large freighter and a few smaller shuttles. They specialize in acrobatics and exotic animals – their stars are the domesticated dirhad from Lubau. The freighter Marmara is in constant need of repairs, and their stops become longer and longer.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 9.7 LEISURE TRAVEL AND PILGRIMAGE</h4><p>The following is a list of suggested destinations and events for leisure travel or pilgrimage.

The colleges run by the Foundation are the most popular and have the best resources. Portal- and xenoarchaeology is the latest trend, fueled by the pseudo-documentary “Tracking the Scarabaeus” about a witty archaeologist searching for Portal Builder ruins in the cold Dabaran desert. The Foundation and the major universities are reluctant to fund expeditions and not even the Colonial Agency sponsors exploratory voyages anymore. Smaller institutes are left to seek funding from wealthy patrons or local lords. Independent skippers with small ships are hired for the expeditions, plus some mercenaries if the job involves risks. In the Hegemony and the courts of Dabaran, funding expeditions is popular and considered a very noble act.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FERMAL-GAROUD’S MATHEMATICAL INSTITUTE</h5><p>Despite the name, Fermal-Garoud’s in Daddah, Dabaran, is not working only with mathematics, but also have faculties for applied sciences like astronics, portal mathematics, xenobiology and xenoarchaeology. Every year they launch expeditions to famous Portal Builder remains in the Horizon and examine the sites using the latest passive sensor technology. The institute’s main sponsor, pasha Nouli-dol-Arahin, also funds independent archaeologists and scientists with interesting ideas. Institutes like Fermal-Garoud’s exist in many places, funding all sorts of scholarships and expeditions. The Nestera School of Archaeology, Konstantinides’ Astronics Academy focusing on deep space phenomena and space archaeology, and the College of History in Tirgonum, Mira, are a few examples.</p><h4>CORPORATE EXPEDITIONS</h4><p>Some of the larger companies are always on the prowl for forgotten technology. This is done in a number of ways. Historical research into old tomes and databases can reveal rumors of hidden installations. Freelance and mercenary expeditions to the outer systems is another way. To minimize risks for the company, freelancers run the expeditions, but a company agent or scientist goes with them to secure the findings. Both Nestera and Nyala are very interested in ancient technology and portal artifacts. Celer-Delekta sponsor expeditions to look for pharmaceuticals and medicinal herbs, just recently on the Uharan forest moons.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 9.8 EXCAVATIONS AND EXPEDITIONS</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 9.8 Excavations and Expeditions]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D66</th><th>DIG OR EXPEDITION</th><th>RECENT EVENTS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>11-12</td><td>The Foundation’s research expedition to Z-29, Zhau</td><td>Professor Gifri has found something in Area Xertes.

The Horizon of today is a melting pot of different cultures, peoples and factions.</p><h5>Zenith and Nadir</h5><p>Many hundreds of years ago, two colossal colonization vessels left Earth. Their names were Zenith and Nadir, and their destination the star Aldebaran. The crews lived their lives aboard the ships, through centuries of deep space travel. One of the ships, the Nadir, was lost somewhere in the darkness during the voyage, without leaving any trace. The Zenith continued, alone, and after traversing the empty void, finally reached its destination. But the humans onboard discovered that they were not the first to arrive in the Third Horizon.</p><p>They arrived in an already colonized cluster of star systems, linked by ancient portals. A long time after the departure of  Zenith, the ruling powers of Earth had discovered one of these portals, and through it a shortcut to what became known as the Third Horizon.</p><h5>The Portals</h5><p>Mankind had discovered a remnant from a highly advanced culture, which they named the Portal Builders. The portals opened the way for humanity to travel the stars, and a new golden age began. Colonization vessels sought out distant stars, establishing the First and Second Horizons. Finally, the Third Horizon was reached, and it became a haven for radicals and freethinkers from the first two horizons. Earth-like worlds were discovered and colonized, massive palaces and temples erected – civilization slowly spread across the Third Horizon.</p><h5>The Portal Wars</h5><p>Eventually, the First Horizon wanted to reclaim the systems that had freed themselves. The newborn separatist powers, headed by the Order of the Pariah, resisted, and war broke out. The slaughter lasted for several years, but ended when the star fleets of the Third Horizon finally wiped out the First Horizon’s lackeys – a faction called the Sacrifice of Nazareem – and closed all portals to the other horizons. The terrible war left in its wake remnants of once great armadas, rifts in the fabric of spacetime, and cities, whole planets even, scorched and destroyed.</p><h5>Zenith</h5><p>When the silence after the war was at its deepest, Zenith finally arrived in the Third Horizon. The massive arkship found its original destination already colonized – by the lords and emirs of Dabaran. After traveling the war-torn Horizon, Zenith decided on the cluster’s central system, Kua, as its new home. However, a mutiny aboard soon divided the crew. The captain’s family fled the ship and settled on the planet Kua’s surface below. The remaining colonists cannibalized their ship, rebuilding it into the great space station Coriolis and declared a new era in the Third Horizon – a time for trade, reawakening and peace.</p><h5>Zenithians and the Firstcome</h5><p>Descendants of the crew of Zenith call themselves Zenithians, while the peoples of the first colonization wave call themselves the Firstcome, as they view themselves as the Horizon’s original settlers. Among the latter however, many have begun identifying as Zenithians, despite not being blood related to the crew of Zenith. This is most common among those who regard themselves as progressive, and who share the Zenithians’ practical take on the Icons and life in general.</p><h5>Coriolis and Kua</h5><p>The center of the Third Horizon is the Kua system, where the space station Coriolis orbits the green jungles of the planet Kua. The system is also home to the burning hot planet Lubau, the acidified Jina, an asteroid belt, the gas giant Xene, the ice planet Surha and, farthest out, an outer asteroid belt where only one of the nine sectors is inhabited. Most of the system’s inhabitants live on the planet Kua. There, many dwell close to an ancient wonder left behind by the Portal Builders – a gigantic monolith, made habitable by the Zenithians – or in the industrial conglomerate that stretches along the planet’s equator.</p><h5>The Factions</h5><p>When the Zenithians founded Coriolis, they sent word to all major powers in the Third Horizon to come to the space station and set up a council for peace and trade. The invitees became known as factions, and the Council a force for peace and commerce, albeit some conflicts remained unsolved. The council factions of today are the Consortium, a group of powerful corporations; the Zenithian Hegemony, the descendants of the captain family onboard Zenith; the Free League, the union of free traders; the mercenaries of the Legion; the secretive Draconites; the divine iconocrates of the Order of the Pariah; Ahlam’s Temple, with its courtesans and philosophers; and lastly the people’s church, the Church of the Icons. Two additional groups are regarded as factions although they are not represented at the Council: the criminal network the Syndicate, and the nomads in the Nomad Federation. Tradition divides the council into Zenithian (the first four factions mentioned above) and Firstcome factions (the four latter). The Syndicate is usually considered Zenithian and the Nomad Federation, Firstcome.</p><h5>The Emissaries</h5><p>As the Third Horizon had just begun to blossom again, and harmony had returned to the Council of factions, the peace was suddenly broken. From the depths of the gas giant Xene rose the faceless Emissaries. Spectres from another world, Icons or Portal Builders? The theories about their origins are many. The Emissaries demanded a seat at the Council – and got one. One of the Emissaries claimed itself an incarnation of the Icon the Judge, to which the Order of the Pariah cried “sacrilege!” and closed their home system to all travel. A new age of shadows and suspicion has dawned, and the peoples of the Horizon all wonder: what is the true agenda of the Emissaries?</p><h5>Conflict</h5><p>Today, new conflicts are flaring up, and old ones are emerging again in the Horizon. The intrigue surrounding the factions thickens, and matters usually settled with a signature or a handshake are now taken to the battlefield. Firstcome revolts against the Zenithian factions, particularly the Consortium, are erupting everywhere. The factions fight each other in proxy wars, through rebel forces, mercenaries, corsairs and toll ships.</p><p>In the midst of all this chaos, a new phenomenon has come to light in the Horizon – people are suddenly showing signs of powers said to be reserved for the Icons themselves. They can tell the future, see things worlds away and even conjure up fire from empty air. These new mystics are a dangerous element to the rest of the population, as they are not yet in full control of their powers.</p><h5>Possibilities</h5><p>The new era does however bring with it many new opportunities for adventurers like you and your group: trading with far-off systems, solving conflicts with your trusty Vulcan carbine, spying on shady corporations or factions, escorting travelers and pilgrims, delivering important messages as couriers, or searching for secrets in the ruins of old, be it the remnants of the Portal Builders or the looming wrecks from the Portal Wars. All this and much more is at your feet in Coriolis – The Third Horizon!</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch1/mira_strid.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"ttoCQaD4ZUCmo5Rh","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266947,"modifiedTime":1680592687069,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hLmLEmsMKNBiOsUN","sort":0,"_id":"dAEzUK7FiyBdmdWA"}

At the heart of the swamp, darkness has corrupted the creatures that didn’t make it out when the Cataract collapsed, and huge schools of twisted beings reside underneath the surface, referred to by the locals as the Thu’ban. The martyr strike team has set up jamming equipment to turn the Sultra valley into a skip zone, but the PCs eventually find their goal, the sunken Sul-Mahala palace just below Cataract 27.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs have left the Conglomerate and are following either Jarja or Leod’s directions toward the stasis pods’ final destination. They have either procured boats of their own or are using the swamp barges found in Leod’s basement (see the The Gunsmith’s Plea event in the previous scene). The journey begins on the outskirts of the city, where only scattered ruins are protruding here and there above the water. After a few hours, navigating the swamp becomes harder and harder. The PCs meet humans and animals going in the opposite direction, fleeing the heart of the swamp. Tales of djinn and demons spread fear among the locals. As the GM, it is important that you introduce the swamp to the PCs as a twisted place, removed from the real world, to make them feel alone, isolated, and afraid.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  CROSSING THE MARSHES</h5><p>The journey from the Conglomerate is difficult. Under normal circumstances, it takes four hours by boat or twelve hours by foot to get to the Sul-Mahala. The PC who takes charge of the group must test SURVIVAL at –1 once every four hours to keep up the pace. Failure means that the group encounters one of the Sultra’s many dangers without it costing you any DP (see Events below), and all PCs suffer 1 point of stress. You are of course free to subject the PCs to nasty surprises as often as you like, but a recommendation is to limit major events to one every four hours.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FINAL DESTINATION</h5><p>If Jarja accompanies the PCs to lead the way, they know where they are going (see the Interference box below), but if the group only have a set of rough coordinates to go on, one PC must pass a difficult (–2) <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> test to find the course. Failure adds four hours to the journey.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs are using the coordinates obtained in the previous scene to find their way to the Sul-Mahala, or are guided there by Jarja. She might be keeping certain details about their destination secret if she is unsure of the PCs’ trustworthiness.</p><h4>THE SULTRA MARSHES</h4><p>A few hours out of the Conglomerate, the waters darken with strange algae and patches of high reeds slow the group down. Tiny islands have formed around the chimneys of the sunken factories and gas pockets let out nauseating puffs of toxic smoke from below. The balconies and domed roofs of the tallest buildings protrude from the water, overgrown by the labyrinthine roots of the Ma’arak trees. The mud and sludge around the trees is home to strange thorns and pale, razor-sharp weeds.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAUNA</h5><p>Seabirds nest on the fringes of the marshes on high cable poles or in the trees. Scattered fish and shellfish can be spotted moving carefully under the surface. In the shadows of the Ma’araks, the water is dark, oily and still. A thick mist enshrouds the heart of the marshes, almost blotting out the warm light of the Kua star. Very few birds or fish live here, and it appears almost as if the mist forms a barricade around downtown Sultra. Only if you dig deep in the mud will you find insects here, such as the kashb, a fist-size type of isopod. The absence of wildlife and the still waters make the silence heavy and ominous. The PCs intrusion seems to disturb something better left alone.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SUNKEN CITY</h5><p>The ruins of downtown Sultra rise from the muddy waters at the heart of the swamp. Cracked domes, terrace gardens, and leaning towers connected by archways are being reclaimed by the wilderness in the shadow of Cataract 27. The breach in the dam exposes the remains of the hydroelectronic machinery that once satisfied large parts of the Conglomerate’s power needs. Next to the dam, a climbing series of marble terraces – constructed by the Consortium’s regional manager Tristan Dayal – used to offer visitors a spectacular view of the waterfall, but the palace gardens below and the aqueducts of the Sul-Mahala have long since become silent and dried up. Moss and seaweed cover the mosaics and statues of old. Reeds and Ma’arak roots surround the downtown area, forcing visitors out of their boats and onto treacherous paths snaking their way up toward the palace. Jarja’s crews had to carry the stasis pods the final stretch up the hill.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>FLYING</h5><p>If the PCs choose to fly to the marshes, the trip shouldn’t take more than half an hour, but the radio interference makes for unreliable sensor data and the thick mist surrounding the palace makes it difficult to navigate manually. The sensor operator must first pass a demanding (–1) DATA DJINN test to calibrate the ship’s outer cameras. Each six on the roll gives the pilot a +1 to her PILOT test. The ship must maintain a low altitude to get underneath the fog, which puts it at risk of colliding with the taller ruins. To avoid a collision, the pilot must pass an insane (–3) PILOT test (potentially modified by the result of the sensor roll). Failure means 1–3 points of damage and forces the group to make an emergency landing at a location of the GM’s choosing.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SULTRA</h5><p>The Sultra is located northeast of the Monolith in what used to be one of the planet’s most fertile regions. Many of the Ramishah’s branches run through the plateaus surrounding the valley, concentrating nutrients and minerals here and filling the Sultra with exuberant life and vegetation. People from across the Horizon came here to create a future for themselves as the place seemed so obviously blessed by the Icons, but disaster struck and the valley was turned into a place of death and despair:</p><ul><li><strong>The Shipwreck</strong>: In CC 57, the lost Foundation research vessel Abdusala was found drifting in Border Space after more than a decade in dark space. The ship was intact and some of her crew still in stasis, although most of the pods were empty and their occupants no longer aboard. The Abdusala was taken to a dockyard closer to the system core and the remainder of her crew were sent to the Foundation’s Hospital for the Treatment and Study of Hyper Sickness in the Sultra.</li><li><strong>Frostbite</strong>: It soon became obvious that most of the survivors had suffered massive psychological trauma as a result of their long sleep, but all records of their treatment have been classified by the Foundation. Rumors say that they displayed a wide range of disturbing deviations from normal human behavior, but also that the hospital staff were sometimes baffled by their razor-sharp perception and insight.</li><li><strong>The Flood</strong>: The catalyst for the dam disaster was when the captain of the Abdusala, Yasin Sabaaha, convinced the hospital staff that the group should be allowed to visit the nearby Cataract 27. Later in the evening, the floodgates opened and the dam collapsed.</li><li><strong>The Cause</strong>: Rumors further claim that when the first responders – a Colonial Marines squadron – arrived, they found dead bodies sitting in a half-circle around a singing Yasin Sabaaha. The cause of death was found to be a massive heart attack in all cases. Yasin was alive, but she had clawed her eyes out and burned off her ears. Everything about the investigation into what happened at the dam and regarding the current whereabouts of Yasin is classified and only known to senior Special Branch officers.</li></ul><p>Parts of the valley are today below water and have few remaining inhabitants. Locals who survived the flood either scattered across the Horizon or went to live in enormous refugee camps throughout the Conglomerate. The camps have turned into permanent parts of the slums in Djindabo, Marzu Khala, and Little Algol. Most who managed to escape the valley suffered terrible losses. Heartache is the only constant in the lives of ordinary Kuans.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/träskruiner.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>INTERFERENCE</h4><p>As the PCs enter the marshes, coms and other radio equipment begin to falter. Static and bursts of atonal whining cause the equipment to restart over and over. Strong communicators (classes III and above) can still be used until the PCs reach the silent downtown area, after which they also fail. A successful SCIENCE test informs the PCs that their gear is being jammed by an active transmitter somewhere nearby. A successful TECHNOLOGY test can further reveal a pattern in the interference that can be traced using a tabula by passing a demanding (–1) DATA DJINN test.</p></div><h4>NPCS</h4><p>The journey through the Sultra is lonely and dangerous. Apart from scattered marshland locals, the PCs will only interact with the people they might have brought with them. As they get closer to the Sul-Mahala, the darkness grows stronger around them and encountering darkmorphs become a threat.</p><ul><li>@Actor[The Sogoi Globe Divers]</li><li>@Actor[The Crew of Odina's Flower]</li><li>@Actor[Jor Andela]</li><li>@Actor[Thu'ban - Small]</li><li>@Actor[Thu'ban - Average]</li><li>@Actor[Thu'ban - Large]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The journey to the Sul-Mahala is not meant to take up too much time. The important thing is to use it to establish the ambiance of the swamp – fear and corruption closes in on the group the nearer they get to their goal. Before the group reaches the palace gardens, use one or two of the events below.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SMUGGLERS IN DANGER</h5><p>The PCs suddenly hear voices through the mist ahead. On a semi-collapsed roof sits a small freighter about to slide into the water, and her crew is working as fast as they can around the ship to keep it from happening. By the ship’s loading ramp, two crew members are desperately trying to fasten ropes and wires to five large cages that have fallen out of the cargo hold and into the mud. Shrill cries can be heard from the cages – about ten @Actor[Ekilibri] (page 318 of the Coriolis core rulebook) in each cage are minutes away from death.</p><ul><li><strong>The Ship</strong>: The freighter Odina’s Flower is a refitted class III courier vessel of the Oryx model (use the @Actor[Oryx - Express Freighter] configuration from page 158 of the Coriolis core rulebook).</li><li><strong>The Smugglers</strong>: Captain Jor Andela is a Zenithian born and raised on Coriolis but the crew appears to originate from the Quadrant of the Pillar.</li><li><strong>The Pilot</strong>: Mogul-descendent Ghûr an-Sarai is wrestling with the thruster controls to try to maneuver the ship to safer ground. Her engineer, former Altai corsair Harian, fell out of the ship along with the ekilbri and is slowly sinking into the dark water.</li><li><strong>The Crew</strong>: Deckhand Sundï and sensor operator Janïr are agendered humanites from the Khôban portal station in the Odacon system. They are trying to rescue the sinking ekilbri.</li><li><strong>A Helping Hand</strong>: The PCs can help the smugglers in a number of ways. They can help save the ekilbri by testing force at –2, or coordinate the crew’s efforts by testing command at –1. An engineer can assist Ghûr inside the ship by testing technology to reroute additional power to the thrusters. The ship’s engineer is trapped underneath one of the sinking ekilbri cages and will suffer the effects of drowning (page 97 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) unless someone successfully tests dexterity at –2 to get him up.</li><li><strong>Fight</strong>: The PCs can choose to stay out of the smugglers’ way, help them, or take advantage of their perilous situation and attack. If they try to help, Jor is first suspicious of their intentions and draws his pistol, but he quickly realizes that he is running out of time and needs all the help he can get. At the cost of 1 DP, something startles the captain and he opens fire on the PCs.</li></ul><p>If the PCs succeed in helping the smugglers rescue Harian and the ekilbri, they are treated as heroes. The smugglers offer them food, basic medical supplies, and other handy gear if they need it. If they managed to save all the ekilbri, Jor promises them a cut of the profit once the delivery has been made (1,500 birr). If the PCs decline his offer, he instead promises to recommend them to his secret benefactor, antiques dealer Lea Marhoun on Coriolis. Lea can be used as a potential future employer.</p><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE GLOBE DIVERS</h5><p>The PCs reach an area where the water is deeper and the vegetation not as dense. Cracked concrete spires and bent dura beams from an old factory protrude from the water like the broken ribs of some ancient leviathan. The group spots a long canoe tethered to one of the beams and catch a glimpse of a faint light deep in the water. The light seems to emanate from clusters of small spheres climbing the ruins. Two Sogoi, a man and a woman, suddenly breach the surface, dressed in primitive diving gear and carrying nets full of sugar globes. The divers are frightened at the sight of the strangers and reach for their weapons in the canoe unless the PCs act calmly and in a friendly manner. If a fight breaks out, use the stats of @Actor[Ramses' Jackals - Algolan] and @Actor[Ramses' Jackals - Sogio] from Blood on the Leaves on page 102. The divers are armed with long rifles and bows. If the PCs instead strike up a conversation with the two Sogoi, they are soon invited back to the diver camp nearby.</p><ul><li><strong>The Sogoi Diver Camp</strong>: The divers belong to a group that chose to stay in Sultra after the Cataract failure. The family consist of two adult men, four adult women and two young children. They have three canoes and a few tents, but have recently moved into the top floor of a ruined apartment building. They have discovered that the moss covering the house somehow purifies the polluted water just enough to make it drinkable. An older, sinewy woman introduces herself as Unkra, the group’s matriarch. Her Zeni is slighly better than the others’ and she offers to barter with the PCs. The Sogoi can offer food, sugar globes, and tabak of a very high quality in return for medicines, medical supplies, and ammunition.</li><li><strong>Sugar Globes</strong>: The divers usually sell the sugar globes for about 25 birr a piece at the markets around the Conglomerate. A PC with at least culture 1 will know that the globes are worth around 500 birr on Coriolis however, and the rarer red ones can bring as much as 1000 birr. The globes are large enough to hold with two hands and are sometimes used by scryers at the souks who believe them to hold magic powers. If the globes are “fed” – rubbed with sugar water for example – they give off a strong, warm light for about an hour. They are commonly found in nicer restaurants placed in jars of sugar water to shine for a whole evening. They count as artifacts, but are easy to comprehend (science +3). The globes are fragile and breaking one is considered a bad omen. The white slime inside is very sticky and has a potent, sweet smell that lingers for days.</li><li><strong>The Curse</strong>: The divers have moved away from the central area of the swamp after hearing frightening tales of dark creatures and ancient curses. They fear the evil, fire-breathing djinn that live in the darkness beyond the palace. The djinn rumors started after the martyr strike team rigged traps with flame throwers and thermal grenades around the hospital (see the A Great, Winged Shadow scene). The divers also avoid the old palace as angered ancestral spirits have awoken to haunt its dark corridors. The spirits are in reality darkmorphs that have woken up in the palace basement after the martyr strike team set up its operation nearby. The Sogoi group are unaware of the martyr strike team, but have noticed an increased number of travelers in the area over the last segments, including boats carrying stasis pods.</li><li><strong>The Living Darkness</strong>: The Sogoi also wish to warn the PCs of the Thu’ban who live in the swamp. They describe the phenomenon as water brought to life by evil djinn. The surface of the water can suddenly rise up and swallow you, pulling you down below to drown you. Sudden movement and noises attracts the Thu’ban (see the Dark Waters and The Terror From Below events below).</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DARK WATERS</h5><p>The water is dark but appears quite shallow. At first glance, it looks as if a web of thick roots and seaweed grow just below the surface of the water, but a successful observation or science test reveals that it must be much deeper; the ruins that are visible nearby are the tops of towers and high buildings.</p><ul><li><strong>It’s Alive</strong>: Suddenly, the roots below the water seem to move – twisting and slithering in a snake-like fashion. The sunlight is reflected in cascades of bright colors as if the surface was covered in oil, and the calm surface stirs all around the PCs. If they are in a boat, they hear scratching noises from underneath.</li><li><strong>Darkworms</strong>: The PCs find themselves in the middle of a slumbering school of Thu’ban, lying in wait just below the surface of the water. If the PCs remain completely still and pass an easy (+2) INFILTRATION test each, the water calms down again and they can escape slowly and carefully. Alternatively, they can choose to move away as fast as possible (pilot –1). If either of the tests fail, the darkworms attack – see The Terror From Below.</li></ul><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE TERROR FROM BELOW</h5><p>The PCs are caught in the middle of a school of Thu’ban, darkworms living and hunting in huge, merciless groups. They are attracted to sound and motion, but can sense living things nearby after they have awoken.</p><ul><li><strong>Schools</strong>: See the description of the Thu’ban above. The DP cost depends on the size of the school; 1 DP for a small school, 2 DP for an average-sized one, and 3 DP for a large school.</li><li><strong>Slumbering Death</strong>: If you choose to let the PCs encounter a slumbering school of Thu’ban, the DP cost is reduced by one (0–2 DP). The PCs might spot the worms and avoid them by testing observation (see modifiers above). If the worms are awake and ambush the PCs however, the cost is 1–3 DP, depending on the size of the school.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0–3 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE PALACE GARDENS</h5><p>After many hours in the dark swamp, the Sul-Mahala and the broken Cataract appear out of the mist. Hundreds of tiny brooks and waterfalls from the northern plateau cut through the ruins in the valley. The water becomes shallower and when the palace’s towers and aqueducts dominate the view ahead, the boat reaches shore. Moss-covered trees and bushes grow among the once beautiful marble benches and pavilions. Low walls and paths run through the area, but the tasteful landscaping has been turned into an overgrown maze by the flood. The PCs have reached the palace gardens, the ring of terraces and architectural marvels that used to be the heart of the Sultra. Several of the terraces have collapsed and the road up to the palace is covered in thick undergrowth and loose gravel and mud. The ground looks steady but has been hollowed out in many places and might collapse.<br />If Jarja has accompanied the PCs here, she pales in horror upon seeing the palace and asks if she can wait by the boat. If the PCs insist she comes along, she will, although trembling with fear.<br />The last stretch of road up to the palace must be walked and climbed, which might prove difficult and dangerous. Use one or more of the unpleasantries below:</p><ul><li><strong>Landslide (1 DP)</strong>: When the group climbs onto the next terrace, the earth beneath them suddenly shifts and moves. Loose soil and mud begin sliding down the slope. Finding a root to grab onto is the only way to keep upright. All characters caught in the slide must pass a dexterity test or get swept away, suffering a strength 6 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 3, armor may be tested).</li><li><strong>Sinkhole (1–2 DP)</strong>: The ground suddenly disappears under the feet of one (1 DP) or several (2 DP) PCs. The affected characters must pass a demanding (–1) dexterity test or get sucked down into an underground river beneath the terrace. A PC who achieves a critical success can help a comrade who failed her roll. A failed roll means landing in thick mud and risks drowning after three turns (page 97 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). Escaping the mud requires passing an insane (–3) dexterity test, or for the other PCs to help the trapped person by testing force at –1. Rope or other climbing gear provide a bonus to the roll.</li><li><strong>River (1–3 DP)</strong>: A wide stream has separated two terraces, blocking the PCs’ path. At the cost of 1 DP, the makeshift bridge set up earlier by Jarja’s crew is still there, but at the cost of 2 DP, the bridge has collapsed. Crossing the bridge requires passing a dexterity test, and at the cost of an additional 2 DP (for a total of 3 points), the bridge collapses while one or several of the PCs are on it. The affected PCs first suffer damage from the fall (six meters, strength 4 attack, weapon damage 1, CRIT 3) and then the effects of drowning (page 97 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) unless they pass a demanding (–1) dexterity test to climb back up.</li></ul><p>Cost: See above</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>LANDING A SHIP</h4><p>If the PCs used their ship to travel to the Sultra and managed to navigate all the way to the palace, they can land on one of the terraces outside. Landing safely requires a PILOT test at –1. Failure results in 2 points of damage to the ship. As the PCs disembark, you could choose to subject them to either the Landslide or Sinkhole effects above without spending DP. The landing has made the surrounding area unstable.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"0c55PA9VytlRlZFD","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296306,"modifiedTime":1682695296306,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"YOMfroAUYC191oYi","sort":0,"_id":"dXpSWDyELAyYOsQc"}

It consists of a group of large corporations which together dominate trade, manufacturing, media, science and colonization.</h3><p><strong>The Consortium and</strong> the Coriolis station are one – so closely tied together that most people in the Horizon can’t tell them apart. Coriolis was constructed using materials from the dismantling of the Zenith, on the orders of the Yriedes family, the seconds-in-command. The Yriedeses had a vision that became the Consortium’s motto: “Sell everything to everyone”. The Yriedes clan, together with the families Parr, Nestera and Evgeni founded the core group of companies that now, some sixty years later, have grown into one huge faction. The Consortium of today consists of about twenty larger companies, all owning installations and factories throughout the Horizon. Most production facilities are located on Kua or in the larger systems, but new colonies are established all the time. The larger corporations have representatives on the board of directors, the faction’s governing body, and the three largest ones – the Bulletin, the Foundation and the Colonial Agency – each have their own seat at the Council of Factions. The current faction director and council member is Tiera Yriedes, closely associated with the military industrial trinity Parr-Nestera, Tilides and Xoar, and a personal friend of Legion general Ekaterina Hierida. The new, aggressive policies promoted by Tiera have begun to escalate conflicts across the Horizon. A storm is coming.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>PRODUCTION</h5><p>The production units of the Consortium are spread across the entire Horizon. How they operate differs, from simple factories of the Conglomerate to more advanced orbital facilities on dedicated space stations. Modular production of things like Vulcan weapons, tags and m-doses runs continuously, while larger and more expensive items are only made-to-order, for example ships of the heavier classes, advanced weapon systems, reactors etc. Things like these are huge investments, which is why the Consortium also has a large network of banks for financing and risk diversification.</p></div><h5>THE COMPANIES OF THE CONSORTIUM</h5><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/Konsortiet_Bulletinen_fraktion.webp\" /></div><p>The companies of the Consortium cover most areas of production, save perhaps the food industry where they are represented only by the Parr bio sculptors’ ready-made meals. They have many famous products on the weapons market, manufactured by Xoar, Dayal, Tilides or Nestera all over the Horizon. Entertainment and information is handled by the Bulletin and Exeter, while companies like the Foundation, Celer-Delekta and Nyala dominate virtually all advanced manufacturing and research. The industrial corporations have the greatest amount of autonomy within the faction, often acting as a counterweight to the three largest members. They are also the ones who are spread the farthest across the Horizon, Alkarra’s Daharab dockyards on Sadaal and Xoar’s research center in Trigon, Mira, being clear examples of this.</p><p>External security is handled by the Legion with their mighty star fleet and fearsome Legionnaires. Most of the big companies have private corporate brigades however, such as the Nestera brigade who cleared the Conglomerate of rebel elements, or the Colonial Rangers, the Agency’s tactical teams. Police matters are handled by the Coriolis Guard with the help of the Judicators, hired from the Hegemony. They are not trusted with internal security however – this falls under the jurisdiction of the intelligence service, the top secret Special Branch. Very few within the Consortium know any details about the affairs of the Special Branch, but they are said to have access to all of the Foundation’s latest research and the corporations’ most advanced technology.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 9.1 THE LARGEST CONSORTIUM COMPANIES</h4><table><thead><tr><th>COMPANY</th><th>MAIN INDUSTRY</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alkarra</td><td>Larger ships</td></tr><tr><td>The Bulletin</td><td>Information, entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Celer-Delekta</td><td>Cybernetic prosthetics, bionics, medicurgy</td></tr><tr><td>Exeter</td><td>Reactors, cruises, tourism</td></tr><tr><td>Hyperion</td><td>Bulk haulers, logistics, freight</td></tr><tr><td>The Colonial Agency</td><td>Mineral prospecting, mining operations, colonization</td></tr><tr><td>Nestera</td><td>Advanced body armor, ground vehicles</td></tr><tr><td>Nomo</td><td>Graviton generators, inertia dampeners</td></tr><tr><td>Nyala</td><td>Computers, hardware, software</td></tr><tr><td>Parr</td><td>Intermediate goods (foods), ship armor</td></tr><tr><td>Parr-Nestera</td><td>Accelerator weapons, body armor</td></tr><tr><td>The Foundation</td><td>Research, education</td></tr><tr><td>Tilides</td><td>Exo suits, smaller ships, probes, torpedoes</td></tr><tr><td>Vulcanor</td><td>Vulcan weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Xoar</td><td>Advanced body armor, shock weapons, thermal weapons</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>THE BULLETIN</h4><p>The largest news agency in the Horizon is the Bulletin, a Coriolis-based media conglomerate. Their motto is “Newsworthy and Accessible”, something that colors both their news coverage and their other programs. Being Coriolis-based, both news and other programs are mainly from the station itself, or from the portal stations, most of which have some degree of Bulletin presence. They do of course send correspondents to the far reaches of the Horizon if some event there is sensational enough, and to the sites and planets most visited by pilgrims. They usually contract freelancers for the most remote jobs – this keeps both the costs and the risks to a minimum.</p><p>Other than news and entertainment, the Bulletin also offers a post and courier service called the Ermes Courier. Ermes ships carry mainly the Bulletin’s own news, but also other messages and information, and, in rare cases, physical mail.</p><h5>THE FACES OF THE BULLETIN</h5><p>A sure ticket to fame in the Third Horizon is to become a known face on a Bulletin broadcast. Jalab Korihan, the star anchor, and morning hostess Nana Elide, who hosts her shows from the top of the Spire, are famous throughout the Horizon and their take on current affairs carries great weight. Jasmin Amliki, star of the popular series “The Plantation Owner’s Daughter”, and Hija Tara Kono from the fashion show “Gilded Veils” are other examples of Bulletin celebrities. The out-of-system correspondents are few but well known, like Alandro Shanatar on Mira or the recently jailed Yvev Dakour in the Zalos system. The Bulletin runs the only real media school in the Horizon – the Lyceum of Propaganda on Coriolis. This is where the reporters and show hosts come to train, but the school has also seen spies, diplomats, and a few successful private detectives pass through its halls over the years. As of late, the Bulletin has become troubled with an increase in independent voices challenging their media dominance – the Red Spider out in the Rimward Reach, Zuraya in the Sadaal system and the Freedom Call on Algol. The recent jailing of the Bulletin’s correspondent to Zalos has led to a diplomatic crisis between the Consortium and the Order.</p><h4>THE FOUNDATION</h4><p>The secular Foundation is the part of the Consortium mainly concerned with research and development. They are known for their starkly rational and scientific – that is to say, Zenithian – view of the world. To the Firstcome, the Foundation is a bastion of non-believers and is shameful to the entire Horizon. The company is, as the name suggests, run as a foundation, selling and leasing their breakthroughs to third parties. Most production methods and patents used by Consortium companies were developed by the Foundation. The Foundation rediscovered the algorithms necessary to understand and use the portal fields, and due to this is a strong presence within the Consortium. This knowledge was at the time only in the hands of the Order and the Nazareem, and they kept it a secret.</p><p>Apart from portal field and astronics research – which takes place at institutes spread all across the Horizon, like the Kander-Mall in the Rimward Reach for example – the main areas of research for the Foundation are socio-arithmetics, intelligence research, portal archaeology and bionics. The intelligence research is mostly focused on ship intelligences and is highly classified, conducted only in secret units under the supervision of the Special Branch. The bionics research on the other hand is completely open for review in an effort to challenge the Order’s monopoly on hospitals and sanatoriums.</p><h5> NEW SCIENCES</h5><p>Socio-arithmetics is a field of study in which mathematical algorithms are applied to whole populations to make macro-political predictions. The Foundation claims that their methods are accurate, but their critics present the fact that they failed to predict the arrival of the Emissaries as proof of the opposite. The professors at the Foundation’s Mathematical Institute say that not every individual can be accounted for in their studies as a response to the criticism. The Bulletin has had great results when using the methods to tailor programs more to the preferences of their viewers.</p><p>The fields of xeno- and portal archaeology receive huge backing from the Foundation. Several expeditions are launched each year, usually in association with the Colonial Agency, to explore ruins, remnants of Portal Builder technology or other artifacts. The biggest site is off-limits to the expeditions however – the inside of the Monolith, closed to rival factions by order of the Astûrban, the Hegemony’s secret police.</p><p>The Foundation’s College of Engineers on Coriolis offers the best natural science education in the Horizon. The generous scholarships offered to promising scientists and students also add to its reputation.</p><h4>THE COLONIAL AGENCY</h4><p>When the Horizon was new and unknown to the Zenithians, the Yriedes family started an agency tasked with financing, launching and establishing new colonies. Nowadays, they rarely find new colonies themselves, and the Colonial Agency, through its extension the Colonial Bank, has shifted its main focus to financing, educating and tech leasing to independent entrepreneurs looking to start mining operations, colonies and factories. They also run a school on Coriolis, the Colonial Agency’s Higher Education Center, where they train the Horizon’s best scouts, explorers and colonists. The top students are recruited to the Colonial Rangers – special ops teams used to secure sensitive investments that require a little more finesse than the blunt fist of the Legion.</p><p>Through investments in the Consortium’s heavy industry, the Agency has access to dust trawlers, mining drones, mobile smelters and other heavy machinery that an entrepreneur might need to lease. Hyperion shuttles and bulk haulers handle transportation.</p><p>The Zenithians and the Consortium are not the only ones who employ the Agency – many Firstcome rulers and merchants, including recently the Iconocrate of Sadaal, are clients here.</p><h5> A HATED FACTION</h5><p>Being a colonial agent is a responsibility that comes with many perks, but also risks. Many view the Colonial Agency as an exploitative, parasitic corporation, thieves that ship resources off-world and pocket the profit – especially so on Algol, where they are strong but despised. They are accused of having caused a terrible natural disaster in which an entire ocean was drained in the search for precious minerals on the ocean floor.</p><p>The most reputable agents are celebrities whose advice is sought before any large project. Ares Kleon, who found the Uharu-12 diamonds, or Minna Jifha, who discovered the silk fields on Menkar and mapped the monolith there, are names that often come up in connection with new expeditions and Bulletin reports. Compared to them, the Agency’s council member, Desaron Kai, is a relatively anonymous figure.<br />The one area the Agency stays clear of is archaeological expeditions. After the catastrophic failure on Menkar when the monolith there crumbled and fell, all such undertakings are left to the Foundation, although joint efforts are not uncommon.</p></div></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"HJIyWLh86Qrne2H2","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266426,"modifiedTime":1680863057813,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"dzE7usePIWLka5L8"}

You can of course locate it somewhere else in the Horizon if it fits better with your story. The cantina is a busy watering hole and as such is a good place to meet new contacts or to start scenarios.</h3><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>Wahib’s cantina is located on the ground floor of a residential building, with its front towards the Promenade. On each side of the cantina, there are small shops – Rashina’s Pets and Ibir’s pawnshop for example. Ibir and Wahib, who owns the cantina, are good friends, sharing many customers. Wahib’s is usually a noisy place, full of people and the smell of cooking. After midnight, the smell from the kitchen is replaced by arrash smoke and soft music as the last of the guests are leaving.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch15/wahibs_labelled.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ENTERING FROM THE PROMENADE</h5><p>The front door is always open, and only a beaded curtain separates the guests from the rush of the Promenade. A sliding door can be shut during the few hours when the cantina closes for the night. There are oblong stained glass windows with geometrical patterns on each side of the door.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ANTEROOM</h5><p>An open, circular room, with low tables and sitting cushions. The mosaic on the floor is worn smooth from years of guests coming and going. Bio sculpted plants give the room a cozy atmosphere. This room seats people who just pop in from the Promenade for a quick cup of kawah or wine, or a relaxing hookah. People who are new to Wahib’s often end up here.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> MAIN ROOM</h5><p>Like the anteroom, this room is also full of tables and cushions. A defective modulate is running in a corner whenever the cantina is open, usually showing the Bulletin flow. As it is an older model, the projection is jittery and the sound is out of sync.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>BULLETIN NEWS</h4><p>The modulate at Wahib’s is a good way for the GM to introduce metaplot information into the game. If the PCs are not paying attention, maybe some other guests are, asking Wahib to turn the volume up. You can find a list of popular Bulletin shows on page 260 @JournalEntry[The Core].</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BOOTH</h5><p>A circular room with small booths containing patterned cushion and low tables. Large plants climb a pedestal in the middle of the room. The booths are often full of hookah smoke, deckhands, stevedores and pilots, at least before a shift change in the port or out on the Net.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BAR</h5><p>A bar with high chairs takes up most of the room. The owner himself can usually be found behind the bar. The bony old Wahib is always working when the cantina is open. From a hook in the ceiling hangs a cage with his biosculpted parrot Nene. Wahib has trained his animal friend to spy on the guests.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> WAHIB’S CHAMBERS</h5><p>The owner’s sleeping quarters, offices and surveillance central. The room contains a bed and a table with a terminal that controls the surveillance systems, which are always active. During nighttime, the terminal activates an alarm that alerts the Coriolis Guard if triggered.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> KITCHEN</h5><p>A stove, a freezer and an oven share this small room with Barah, the chef. The kitchen offers a small selection of simple dishes.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STOREROOM</h5><p>A small storeroom for kawah, tea, kohôl, wine, tabak and some basic ingredients for the kitchen.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BACK DOOR TO A NARROW ALLEY</h5><p>A sliding door connects the cantina with a narrow alley. The people living in the residential modules above usually hang their laundry out to dry here, which makes for a cold and wet passage.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>Wahib’s cantina attracts ship’s crews and fortune seekers, as well as ordinary spaceport workers. Many people quickly become regulars here. Wahib’s memory is crystal clear when it comes to people’s orders, but he is terrible at remembering names and faces. This selective memory is especially potent when the Guard come around asking about his customers, a trait that makes the cantina a place often used by criminals and other shady people as neutral ground for negotiations, usually during the early hours of the morning when the place is closed. For this reason, the cantina is often visited by plainclothes Guards.</p><p>The cantina opens in the afternoon, immediately starting to fill up with thirsty customers. The free trader crews show up during the evening, with the regulars dropping in a little after that for a late dinner. The mood rises as the kohôl starts to flow and the hookahs are lit. People start to leave come nightfall, and when the night watch begins, most stevedores have gone. The last stragglers leave just before dawn. The cantina is cleaned and prepared for the coming day in the early hours of the morning.</p><h4>PEOPLE AT WAHIB’S</h4><p>Wahib’s is a place that attracts many different people. The GM can use the cantina for meetings with the group’s patron – or maybe their nemesis? The waiters here are Wahib’s three grandchildren, Iri, Habib and Ala. The trio have no problems picking the pockets of the guests or switching their tags for empty ones (Agility 2, dexterity 1). Accusations of theft against the little rascals are waved away as playful pranks, and the regulars have a love-hate relationship with the three.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">WAHIB, CANTINA OWNER</div>@Actor[Wahib, Cantina Owner]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch15/16 Wahib.webp\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">ARKIAL LIMA, HIGH ROLLER</div>@Actor[Arkial Lima, High Roller]<div class=\"blueheader\">RAMAL AND FORBO, FACTIONARIES</div><p>@Actor[Ramal, Factionary]<br />@Actor[Forbo, Factionary]</p><div class=\"blueheader\">NIGIEL FO, COURTESAN</div>@Actor[Nigiel Fo, Courtesan]<h4>EVENTS</h4><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARKIAL’S SECRET</h5><p>The high roller Arkial Lima is on the run from an enforcer, as usual. She has a deal lined up, but needs one more day to close it. She can offer the PCs a secret in return for protecting her until she can pay her loan back. At a holo game a few days ago, she heard an intoxicated merchant talk about a colony in the asteroid belt that would soon run out of spare parts because of an act of sabotage. The merchant went on to talk about a sale of spare parts in another part of the system – maybe in the Monolith, in the Free League auctions on Coriolis or somewhere else. It is up to the PCs how they want to use this information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EARLY RETIREMENT</h5><p>Council member Jesibel Niales of the Free League has come to realize that the faction’s ties to the Syndicate are becoming too much of a liability. The problem can of course be traced back to Ramal and Forbo. Jesibel cannot act against the duo directly, but could hire external help such as the PCs. She needs real proof, holographic evidence showing that Ramal and Forbo are doing the Syndicate’s bidding. Could the PCs be persuaded to help her? If they accept, their mission will be to befriend the duo, follow them around, and investigate who they are meeting with and where. Breaking into their living modules, storage units or ships might also be necessary. The payment could be a Free League membership (higher reputation) and good tips on upcoming cargo auctions.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A HIGH-STAKES AUCTION</h5><p>The PCs come into possession of a strange artifact, possibly even an animated object from before the Portal Wars. Nigiel Fo could act as an agent to help them find a buyer. The prospective buyer needs a little more time to come up with the money however, and the night before the sale, thieves try to burgle the PCs and steal the artifact. If they fail, a group of mercenaries attempt to take the object by force. A shady cult called the Beholders of Truth, connected to Portal Builder worship, are out to claim the artifact for themselves as they regard it as a holy item. Several cultists are high-ranking socialites on the station, which could complicate matters further.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE MENU AT WAHIB’S</h4><p>Wahib’s is not known for its gastronomic edge – on the contrary. The menu is a range of safe bets, classic dishes from all over the Horizon. Use Table 6.2 in the Rulebook for inspiration.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE FACTIONARIES AND THE LEAGUE</h5><p>Ramal and Forbo are heavy names in the Free League hierarchy, if not at the very top. This doesn’t stop them from publicly criticizing Jesibel Niales however, but they behave well if she is present in person. They need her, and she obviously needs them. The rumors about the Free League having dealings with the Syndicate name Ramal and Forbo as the link between the two factions.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch15/bostäder_horisonten.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"mfC02x9CJ8LORs8n","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266984,"modifiedTime":1680376266984,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"bArkpH8OiKEDtwIk","sort":0,"_id":"e1MoE8ciefl3Ve6I"}

There is more open space, more light, and less people here than in the Ring or the Core. The ceilings are higher, the ventilation systems make sure the air is fresh and dry, the holo sky is brighter here than down below, and the street lights in the narrow streets keep the shadows away. The Spire consists of some two hundred floors. The lower ones are numbered from 1 upwards, while the higher levels have fancy names like Therr, Ardha, Lunah, Afridate, or Alkamarra, which is the top floor where the restaurant with almost the same name can be found. The lower floors are usually a more or less controlled chaos of corridors and streets running between markets, recreational facilities, shopping centers and other public places. The station’s commoners reach the Spire via elevators from the Core that run up to the lower floors. To get even farther up, one has to change elevators or, as the wealthy do, continue in a comfortable grav chair or palanquin through private shafts that lead upwards. A few places of interest in the Spire are described below.</p><h4>ALKAMAAR’S RESTAURANT</h4><p>The restaurant at the top of the Spire is legendary across the Horizon, and foodies from every system travel here just for the tasting menu. Taking into account that it usually takes several segments to get a reservation here – unless you are a regular – one can book a table and then begin traveling to Coriolis from practically anywhere in the Horizon. The entrance to the restaurant is guarded by Alkamaar’s mythical stone figures – relics of old, vaguely humanoid warriors in pale jade, red marble, and black basalt. When you walk inside, you are welcomed by the smell of spices, orchids, and other flowers mixed with the perfume of the guests and sweet, soothing incense. A real courtesan will take you by the arm  and escort you to your table and then retreat to a nearby divan to rest, only a wave away, during your visit. Through the glass armanite dome above, you can watch the green jungles of Kua far, far below. There are several menus to choose from depending on your palate – and your wallet, as everything here ranges from very expensive to ridiculously expensive. Those who cannot afford a visit can buy a ticket for the Alkamaar’s lottery that draws one winner every segment. The lottery tickets can be bought in most places of gambling on Coriolis.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">REGULARS AT ALKAMAAR’S</div><ul><li>Judge Nigelia Kurahan</li><li>Ambassador Johar Quassar</li><li>Courtesan Domina Ferex</li><li>Merchant and Consortium factionary Ivrahim Nestera</li><li>Technocrat Janos din Nimatallah</li><li>Hegemonist Hiram din Hrama</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/07 Alkamaar2.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.8 ENCOUNTERS IN THE SPIRE</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.8 Encounters in the Spire]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Khamaani</td><td>Diplomat</td><td>Big hair</td><td>Walking</td><td>Rank</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Lasamsen</td><td>Servant</td><td>Old-fashioned uniform</td><td>On an errand</td><td>Loyalty</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Oenti</td><td>Ambassador</td><td>Masked</td><td>Conspiring</td><td>Personal gain achieve</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Qun</td><td>Courtesan</td><td>Uses hand fan</td><td>Watching</td><td>Vengeance</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Xerxes</td><td>Rich brat</td><td>Oily hair, tanned</td><td>Mocking</td><td>Become like daddy</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Devenah</td><td>Royal successor</td><td>Sequined clothes</td><td>Mingling</td><td>Make a difference</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>KHERIA’S ARBORETUM</h4><p>The 14th floor of the Spire houses an enclosed grove full of songbirds, exotic plants, and landscapes from all over the Third Horizon. Both visitors and residents come here for a moment’s peace or to remember their home planets. The arboretum is a hotspot for acrobats, tarrabs, sibyls, and all sorts of street performers.</p><h4>ABHRRA</h4><p>The 96th floor is really one of a kind as it is dominated by the large, man-made Lake Abhrra. Paths and promenades follow the waterside and along the outer walls there are a few hundred luxurious two-story living modules, each with their own balconies facing the lake and a small jetty where the owners can moor their decorated lake rafts. If a day of solitary fishing is not your idea of a good time you could always take the raft over to the Abhr Minas restaurant among the palm trees on the tiny atoll in the middle of the lake.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE RESIDENCE OF THE EMISSARY</h5><p>The Emissary from Xene lives on the Abhrra level, on a slope just by the lake. The residence is a three-room apartment in a small house where the Council has made sure the other apartments are empty.</p><h4>THE IJADRA</h4><p>The Ijadra is a very popular entertainment complex located on level 12, especially among families with children. Many residents from the Core come here to enjoy holo movies, theater, exhibitions, playgrounds, cafés, or one of the restaurants in the food court.</p><h4>ARDHA, LUNAH, AND AFRIDATE</h4><p>The floors from level 150 and upward contain luxurious palaces for important officials, the wealthiest merchants and high-ranking factionaries. The floors are designed to remind one of the Zenithians’ ancient home and are beyond extravagant. The climate here is much more dry and cool than in the rest of the station, modeled after the stories of Al-Ardha, and the holo sky is almost twenty meters high. The residences here are usually three or four buildings erected around one or more courtyards with mosaic floors, fountains, and lush cherry trees.</p><h4>THE PALACE OF THE HEGEMONY</h4><p>The otherwise dry Therr level is also home to the Hegemony’s mission to Coriolis. A huge, sky blue dome surrounded by eight Icon towers in an octagonal shape crowns the whitewashed palace. The geometric perfection between the dome and the octagon and the ratio between the towers and the dome demands respect from even a Dabaran architect. The towers almost reach the holo sky above. Small jungle oases with Kuan flora surround the palace and special ED fields keep temperature and humidity high. Ambassador Johar Quassar is responsible for the Hegemony’s relations with Coriolis, assisted by several courtesans and cultural attachés.</p><h4>THE RESIDENCE OF THE GOVERNOR</h4><p>Not far from the palace of the Hegemony lives the Governor of Coriolis, Kemal Dargosian. His beautifully designed palace surrounded by palm trees, commonly called the Seraglio, contains wide-open halls, tiled floors, and many fountains and pools. The household employs several courtesans and singers to create a pleasant setting. The garden outside features some remarkable topiary work with bushes and trees shaped in geometrical patterns. The grounds are circled by a low wall above which black globes hover – they are not ornamental, but rather something advanced from the technical divisions of the Consortium. The plethora of theories about the matter suggest that that they are attack drones, field generators, explosive charges, and many other things. There is a big party in the Governor’s residence once per triad to which voting citizens, special dignitaries, and factionaries are invited. The lucky odd contestant on the Wheel of Fatima could also get an invitation to the party as a prize on the show.</p><h4>THE PALACE OF THE COUNCIL</h4><p>On the 145th floor of the Spire you will find the Palace of the Council, a grand, star-shaped building with many wings. This is where the Council of Factions convenes to decide the future of the Horizon. Each wing can fit an entire faction’s staff of bureaucrats, notaries, courtesans and servants, as well as richly decorated offices for each of the council members. At the heart of the building lies the Faction Hall, lit by nine eternity lights – artifacts from distant Amedo.</p><h4>THE SPIRE PLAZA</h4><p>The Spire Plaza can be found on level 66 and is the place where the Popular Assembly gathers all voting men and women of Coriolis to advise the Council. When the Assembly is in session, the Council’s private army, the Pretorian Guard, close off the plaza. The public is welcome to enjoy the stunning view of eternity through the panorama windows of the plaza anytime in between the sessions. If you wish to engage with a member of the Assembly, your best bet would be to visit the Core Plaza where they are usually found discussing politics in one of the kawah shops.</p><h4>THE DOCKS OF THE CORIOLIS GUARD</h4><p>The garrison that protects the station and supervises the customs tolls has their docks in the Spire. The pilots of the Steel Hawks Flotilla serve their Nestera Hawk X-9 fighters here between missions. The Steel Hawks and the Nighthawks from the Monolith perform a joint maneuver once per year, ending with a mighty air show outside the dome of Alkamaar’s.</p><h4>ISCHARA</h4><p>Levels 165 through 168 are what the locals call “Consortium City”. The district is really named after the third Governor of Coriolis, Moratio Ischara, who helped finish the construction of the station. The Ischara is devoted solely to Consortium companies, and the three big ones – the Bulletin, the Colonial Agency, and the Foundation – each has a huge complex here. The most noticeable building here is the leaning, rhombic tower of the Foundation, called the Tower of Letyr after the scientist Osimian din Letyr, a pioneer in the field of intelligence research. Open parks with artificial lawns, sculpture groves, and streams separate the big company buildings. Small cantinas and restaurants gather people from different companies in informal discussion. A central hub holds express elevators directly to the Core Plaza. Large parts of the Ischara are empty however, as many Consortium companies have chosen to move their headquarters closer to their production – to the Conglomerate on Kua.</p><h4>THE FOUNDATION’S ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM</h4><p>On level 164, just below the Ischara, the Foundation has collected many archaeological finds from the Horizon. The faction’s xeno-archaeological institute, the wet dream of all ambitious archaeologists, is located nearby. The round museum has a wide courtyard constructed as a neo-Zenithian interpretation of the circular ruins found on Uharu-9. Its collections contain several Portal Builder artifacts such as light globes, an opened healing scarab, and the mysterious Massara machine – an artifact constructed of what appears to be ceramic plates that slowly change in configuration. Ruins from many different places have also been imported and reconstructed here, the round Uharu-9 houses for example, as well as an old Sadaalian step pyramid and sentinel statues from Aspara. A huge zero-G aquarium holds a floating nanite cloud, supposedly a part of the Scourge of Ashes from Odacon.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>lOST ARTIFACT</h5><p>The Foundation’s xeno-archaeologist Dina Marrakali has returned from an expedition to Uharu-9 with a large haul of Firstcome items and maybe even some Portal Builder artifacts. While everything was being properly logged and processed, the unthinkable happened – a rectangular, white sandstone statuette disappeared. The data djinn can find no trace of a burglary, and so Dina and her archivist Chuma Hirami have become the prime suspects. They deny the accusations, but are unable to explain how the artifact has gone missing.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Q137trfpNMtfFOu5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3,"6Di8yMnm3jtdNeRI":2},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.3.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266895,"modifiedTime":1684524711146,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"wz390mVwR1sEKuel","sort":0,"_id":"eTUH0xv8PJBKXQev"}

In the four systems of the Quadrant, Firstcome and Zenithians meet on equal terms.</p><p>The Quadrant of the Pillar spans the four systems along the newly established Odacon route between Kua and Mira: Altai, Sivas, Ordana, and Zhau. The systems share many cultural traits, from the routines of daily life to governance and civil liberties. The similarities can be traced back to the first wave of colonists that were kept alive over the years thanks to the fact that the Quadrant systems kept trading and communicating with each other during the Long Night. The new colonists in the Quadrant have been integrated into the culture of the systems, but have also contributed with influences of their own. Of the factions, the Consortium is the one who shows the greatest interest in the systems, insistently trying to further its own agenda through alliances, colonization and trade. The Consortium wants to replace the old power structures with usurpers friendly to the faction.</p><h4>A PARADISE LOST</h4><p>The Quadrant of the Pillar has a high concentration of rich, habitable worlds. Reports from the Foundation’s investigations here indicate that the Portal Builders likely have had something to do with shaping the systems. Some of the more patriotic scientists in the Quadrant believe that the high number of rich worlds in the systems is to be regarded as a sign that the area has been chosen to serve some higher, sacred purpose. They believe that the Quadrant is a promised land in the dark emptiness, and that all that is missing is a strong, Icon-fearing leader to show the way.</p><p>The worlds are only lightly populated, despite their natural riches, and it is only recently that a broad wave of colonists has started to arrive. Colonizing the Quadrant has its risks however – slavers, corsairs, self-appointed freedom fighters and bloodthirsty warlords are just a few of the dangers that await the reckless or the foolhardy.</p><h4>THE JANGAHIR FLEET</h4><p>The mogul fleet constitutes the nervous system of the Quadrant. They cemented their claim to power directly after the Portal Wars. Unlike the rest of the peoples of the Quadrant, they challenged the ancient portal fields and managed to unravel their secrets. The fleet thrived from its monopoly position. Their battered old ships, relics from the Second Horizon, were upgraded and modified, resulting in a fantastic mixture of different technologies and traditions. They have reigned in silent majesty for a long time, but the arrival of the Consortium in the systems has challenged their rule and started to undermine their power. Mogul trade used to rule worlds and move mountains, but this is rapidly changing. The competition has led to tension in the Quadrant, but open clashes between the Consortium and Jangahir’s heirs have so far been limited.</p><h4>THE ALTAI CORSAIRS</h4><p>Blood-curdling rumors about the merciless raids of the corsairs from Altai have spread across the entire Horizon. Altai is a haven for smugglers, slavers, pirates and other outlaws, giving the whole Quadrant somewhat of a reputation for being a wild place where the difference between might and right is a bit fuzzy.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch13/dabaran_molnstaden.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"twxkuslQoqHeTwyV","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266774,"modifiedTime":1680376266774,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"eqZdSZyJd3KB3rzD"}

Most of it is unknown to both the players and to you as the GM. This chapter contains the tools you need to create systems and populate them for the player group to explore.</h3><p><strong>The Third Horizon</strong> can be brought to life in a few easy steps. Every group’s Horizon should be a unique experience that you create together. Below are the all details for creating your own systems.</p><h4>THE GENERATOR</h4><p>There are thirty-six systems in the Third Horizon, but only the core systems are described in detail, and a few of the smaller ones are briefly described in the Coriolis core rulebook (page 311 @JournalEntry[The Small Gems]). On the Horizon map, you will find a few short sentences about each system. When you as the GM are about to create a system for the PCs, start at the top and work your way down. A few things are already decided, such as what color the star of the system is, how many planets it contains and if there are any gas giants or asteroid belts there. Nothing is certain however – the Foundation’s astronics have discovered “forgotten” planets, rock belts and moons on several occasions. As the GM, you are free to change the information on the Horizon map to make it fit your group better.</p><p>The system generator is made up of a few tables describing the planet’s appearance, surrounding space, atmosphere, temperature, nature and finally population, adventure and mission hooks and faction presence. You can roll dice on the tables or just choose the entries you like.</p><ul><li>Size 2D6</li><li>Orbit 2D6</li><li>Atmosphere 2D6</li><li>Temperature 2D6</li><li>Geosphere 2D6</li><li>Population 2D6</li><li>Space port 2D6</li><li>Scenario hooks D66</li><li>Factions 2D6</li></ul><p>There are many different planets in the Horizon, from the scalding hot Lubau to the frozen Hiperion, from lava-covered Pyre to humid Basilka. The tables below can be used for all kinds of planets, except for gas giants and asteroid belts that have their own tables.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Roll Tables</h5><p>You can use Planet, Gas Giant, and Asteroid belt generators:</p><ul><li>@RollTable[Planets - System Generator]</li><li>@RollTable[Gas Giants - System Generator]</li><li>@RollTable[Asteroid Belts - System Generator]</li></ul><p>or use the individual tables below.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE SYSTEM GENERATOR AND REALITY</h5><p>This system generator does not claim to represent our own reality. Coriolis is a game that moves between hard science fiction and science fantasy. A semblance of realism and logic is desirable, but not at all necessary. If you as the GM want micro planets with breathable atmosphere or huge planets that are not gas giants, this is completely up to you, and this could in fact give the story a little extra mystique.</p></div><h4>PLANET SIZE</h4><p>The size of a planet can vary a great deal even if it is not a gas giant. The most common are planets like Kua with a gravity of around 1 standard G. The size listed is the diameter of the planet in kilometers, with examples of roughly equivalent bodies from the Solar System. The Coriolis core rulebook describes the planets in the Kua system and their sizes. Worlds with lower than 0.7 G are considered low-gravity worlds and can harbor thin life forms, weirdly tall plants, gliding creatures and alien terrain.</p><p>Worlds with high gravity, above 1.3 G, are often massive worlds with level terrain, large oceans and high concentrations of metals. The life forms present are often either marine or subterranean. On both low and high-G worlds, unaccustomed PCs and NPCs will have trouble moving around and get a -2 to all <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong>, <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> and <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong> tests. After a period of acclimation, the modifier disappears.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 1 Planet Size</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 01 Planet Size]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>SIZE</th><th>GRAVITY</th><th>EXAMPLES</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>&lt; 1,000km</td><td>Almost 0-G</td><td>Ceres and other asteroids</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2,000 km</td><td>0.1 G</td><td>Iapetus</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4,000 km</td><td>0.2 G</td><td>Luna, Europa</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>7,000 km</td><td>0.5 G</td><td>Mars</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>10,000 km</td><td>0.7 G</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>12,500 km</td><td>1.0 G</td><td>Earth, Venus</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>15,000 km</td><td>1.3 G</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>20,000 km</td><td>Almost 2 G</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GAS GIANTS</h5><p>Gas giants differ from other planets in size and composition. They can be found in the outer reaches of their systems. A gas giant near a sun is an anomaly, and probably affected by some form of artifact or other strange secret. When creating a gas giant using the gas giant tables, roll dice on tables 2 to 5 to determine size, color, temperature and characteristics. You don’t use tables 10 to 12 for gas giants. The atmosphere is considered toxic or worse. The temperatures range from the cold of space in the outer atmosphere to solar heat in the core. Use the tables for regular planets to determine population, but roll only D6. A gas giant normally has 3D6 moons. The diameter of the moons is usually up to 5,000 km, but there are exceptions – the largest of Uharu’s forest moons has a diameter of 8,000 km. You can generate these moons as planets if you like and use tables 9 and 13 to 17 to generate the population in orbit around the gas giant. The characteristics of a gas giant can be anything from rings to mysterious spots that are warmer or colder than the surrounding area, so-called “holes”. On rare occasions, gigantic gas creatures inhabit the atmosphere.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 2 Gas Giant Size</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 02 Gas Giant Size]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>SIZE</th><th>THE SOLAR SYSTEM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>40,000 km</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>60,000 km</td><td>Uranus, Neptune</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100,000 km</td><td>Saturn</td></tr><tr><td>5-9</td><td>150,000 km</td><td>Jupiter</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>200,000 km</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>250,000 km</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 3 Giant Gas Color</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 03 Gas Giant Color]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>COLOR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Shimmering grey</td></tr><tr><td>4-6</td><td>Sulphur yellow</td></tr><tr><td>7-9</td><td>Red orange</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Emerald green</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Azure blue</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Black</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 4 Gas Giant Temperature</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 04 Gas Giant Temperature]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>TEMPERATURE</th><th>METALS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2-6</td><td>-200 Celsius</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>0 Celsius</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>500 Celsius</td><td>Lead</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>1,000 Celsius</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>2,000 Celsius</td><td>Lava, melting point of gold</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>3,000 Celsius</td><td>Iron</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 5 Gas Giant Characteristics</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 05 Gas Giant Characteristics]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2-3</td><td>Rings</td></tr><tr><td>4-6</td><td>Storms</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>Spot/super storm</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>Warm/cold hole</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Gas creatures</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Artifact in orbit</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ASTEROID BELTS</h5><p>Several of the systems in the Third Horizon contain asteroid belts. They vary in size and density, from the rich, thick belt in Kua to the dusty Ash belt in Odacon. Some belts are wide and massive, especially if there is no gas giant around to prevent its spread, such as Xene is doing in the Kua system. As often pointed out by the Foundation’s astronics, gas giants work like asteroid herders. An asteroid belt is created by rolling dice on tables 6 to 8 to determine size, composition and characteristics. Larger asteroids can be handled as small planets and created separately. You can use tables 13 to 17 to generate population but treat an asteroid belt as a small planet (size 1-3) when generating population.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 6 Asteroid Belt Size</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 06 Asteroid Belt Size]</p><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>SIZE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Small ring, smaller than the diameter of a planet (5-10,000 km)</td></tr><tr><td>2-4</td><td>Regular, about 1-2 AU wide</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Massive, 10 AU wide and high.

There can be space stations in orbit even if the planet is without larger spaceports.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 9 Orbit</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 09 Orbit]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>IN ORBIT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>Roll D6 times on the table</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Forgotten stations</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Satellites</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Space stations</td></tr><tr><td>6-8</td><td>Empty space</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>Moon/moons</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Rings or gravel belt</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Orbital asteroid belt</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>ATMOSPHERE</h4><p>The atmosphere of a planet can vary a great deal (table 10), from being almost non-existent on small planets, to being heavy and dense on other planets. It could also be toxic or dangerous in some other way, but if the colonist is in luck, it is breathable. The size of a planet affects the atmosphere, and the low-digit entries (2-8) are generally more common for smaller worlds, while the higher ones (9-12) are associated with large worlds.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 10 Atmosphere</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 10 Atmosphere]</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6</th><th>ATMOSPHERE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2-2</td><td>Toxic*</td></tr><tr><td>3-3</td><td>Thin*</td></tr><tr><td>4-8</td><td>Breathable</td></tr><tr><td>9-9</td><td>Dense</td></tr><tr><td>10-10</td><td>Corrosive, toxic</td></tr><tr><td>11-11</td><td>Infiltrating, toxic</td></tr><tr><td>12-12</td><td>Special</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/planet3.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TOXIC</h5><p>The toxic atmosphere is not breathable but has the right density to sustain life. The toxicity could be a result of high levels of carbon dioxide or poisonous gases. A filter mask is necessary to breath outdoors in this atmosphere. Without a mask, the person will suffer drowning attacks (see the Coriolis core rulebook, page 97 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THIN</h5><p>A thin atmosphere is not breathable and can almost be compared to vacuum. Exo shells are necessary to visit worlds with thin atmospheres. Damage to the exo leads to explosive decompression as it would in vacuum (Coriolis core rulebook, page 99 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). On worlds with a thin atmosphere, only in deep ravines or cracks will the pressure be high enough for humans to survive without exo shells. Filter masks are still necessary there though.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  BREATHABLE</h5><p>The atmosphere contains the proper levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide to sustain base humans and other common life forms.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DENSE</h5><p>A dense atmosphere is the opposite of a thin one. Reinforced exo shells are necessary when visiting these worlds, and only on very high altitudes can normal life exist and humans take the exos off. Filter masks are still necessary though. Damage to the exo leads to an implosion-like effect with the same rules as vacuum exposure (Coriolis core rulebook, page 99 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CORROSIVE, TOXIC</h5><p>Corrosive atmospheres are toxic and burn the lungs. The corrosive attack is an opposed roll, Strength vs. the toxicity of the atmosphere (usually 1-3, CRIT 2). Test once per turn. The person exposed also suffers drowning attacks (Coriolis core rulebook, page 97 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). Exo shells protect against corrosive atmospheres.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INFILTRATING, TOXIC</h5><p>An infiltrating atmosphere is corrosive but of a kind that also affects gear. Seals in exos and gear are destroyed after 2D6 hours. Special alloys and materials are necessary to survive in the atmosphere. Living creatures exposed to infiltrating atmosphere are affected by a corrosive attack (see above) with a toxicity of 4-8.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SPECIAL</h5><p>This atmosphere could be varying across the planet’s surface, it could be dense at the equator and thin around the poles, have liquid form or have some other special properties decided by the GM.</p><h4>TEMPERATURE</h4><p>The temperature of a planet is mainly dependent on its distance from the sun, but is also affected by the atmosphere.

Don’t hesitate to change things that don’t fit. You can use the characteristics listed for each system on the Horizon map as a guide, but only if they fit with your story.</p><p><em><strong>Example</strong>: When the PCs arrive in the Caph system, the GM uses the tables above to create one of the planets circling the blue star Caph-A. The Horizon map describes Caph as a binary system known for the Caph platforms, the Hydra flotilla and red gas rock. The GM names the planet Quidar and starts rolling dice. There are a few satellites orbiting the planet (4). Quidar itself is a small planet with a diameter of about 7000 km, a gravity of 0.5 G (6) and a breathable atmosphere (7). It is a temperate planet (5) which makes it relatively Earth-like. Quidar’s geosphere is arid (3) and the GM decides that the planet is mostly dry land with one big ocean. A few thousand people call Quidar their home (7).<br />The space port roll is modified by the population and gets a -4. The roll gives Quidar only a smaller landing strip (2). The GM rolls the Factionary clashes hook (43) but decides to wait to determine the details of the conflict until he has rolled the factions rolls. On table 16, he rolls a 2 – two factions in balance. The two factions in question become the Zenithian Hegemony and the Legion.<br />The GM decides that the Caph platforms are the satellites orbiting Quidar, and that they are used as bases by the Hydra flotilla, which are corsair hunters in the service of the Hegemony. The factionary clash is a newly arisen conflict between the Hegemony and the Legion on the surface of the planet. The red gas rock is determined to be from the gas giants of Caph- B. The gas rock is exported via the Caph platforms after the 100 AU journey through empty space from Caph-B. Quidar’s inhabitants are concentrated around the Jevghena colony in the northern plains.</em></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>DISTANCES IN A SYSTEM</h5><p>A star system is usually about 50 AU wide from the sun to the Oort cloud. In binary and trinary systems the suns circle around each other, but not always in the same plane. That’s why some systems are closer than 50 AU from each other.</p><p>You can place your planets anyway you like. We have purposely not detailed the placement of the planets in the described systems, except for Kua (Coriolis core rulebook, page 280 @JournalEntry[Chapter 12 - The Kua System]). Gas giants should be located in the outer reaches of a system. The locations of life-sustaining worlds can vary, but they are often found near the center of the system. The distances can vary depending on the star type of the system. We recommend finding some astronomical literature if you wish to know more.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"YK9nvWL1gLIKdxLv","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264919,"modifiedTime":1680376264919,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"fC2eOXQ5fg9LlS6G"}

They are renowned for their fearlessness in both combat and diplomacy, and are said to make no distinction between the two. The faction originated in the part of the crew of the Zenith that valued resolve and willpower above all else. They viewed the commanding Quassar and Yriedes families as too entrenched in the discussions about what to do with the colonists in stasis, and instead went ahead and woke them up on their own. They were among the first to leave the Zenith after the awakening, disappearing into the dark. Whatever it was that they found out there among the debris and ruins on abandoned worlds no one knows, but they quickly became the stuff of legends, ghosts seldom seen but intensely discussed. The stories claim that their travels in the Dark between the Stars turned them into something cold and purely egotistical. When they reentered the light of civilization, they did it as a disciplined faction of warrior philosophers, possessing secret truths the other factions could only dream of.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SECRETS OF THE DRACONITES</h5><p>The Draconites wield advanced technology with obvious elements of the lost wisdom of the old Horizons. How they have acquired this technology is unknown, but whispers in the shadows tell of unspeakable pacts with hidden orders from before the Portal Wars, or even alliances with creatures beyond human comprehension. The Draconites themselves say nothing.</p><p>The organization of the order is secret, but they would seem to operate in cells centered on strong leaders, with a minimum of contact between the individual groups. Or perhaps someone, or something, is pulling the strings from the shadows, guiding the faction towards some obscure goal. The only thing known for certain is that they have a system of apprentices, where a senior member guides and educates a younger novice through the mysteries of the order. Some people believe that the order is made up of a series of circles, with the members all seeking entry to the next circle and the next, advancing towards the inner sanctum at the center. The select outsiders who have witnessed the arcane rituals where a Draconite warrior appears to be transcending to a higher form of wisdom supports the latter theory.</p><p>The philosophy of the order is the subject of much debate and the most outlandish of theories. That they emphasize conflict as a metaphysical concept is clear to anyone. They regard it as a form of both personal and collective growth. Even though most would think this a very violent approach to the world, some say that it is just as much about inner conflict, about the perpetual struggle with the impure parts of the self, and that the Draconites seek to confront and defeat their inner demons, no matter the cost. This is in many ways reflected in the order’s worship of the Lady of Tears in her cold and strict form, the Executioner. Her sword is sharp and always ready for whoever breaks the traditions or codes of the order, but also for the weak of heart. The Executioner protects any and all who are in control of their own lives and who choose their own death</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/Drakoniterna_fraktion.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NO HOME OR HEARTH</h5><p>No one knows the location of the Draconites’ headquarters. The order is present in many places throughout the Horizon, but usually only with one or a few members. There is much speculation about the order’s actual size and distribution. They were recently offered a seat at the Council of Factions, perhaps motivated by the Consortium sticking to the logic of “keep your friends close but your enemies closer”.</p><p>Only one Draconite is known to reside on Coriolis, the council member Mandragor Ho, who, despite a plain appearance, can make the most seasoned of Bulletin reporters shake in their shoes. The exact role of the spokesperson is unclear.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"AYHj0bSRwpED6Svx","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266482,"modifiedTime":1680376266482,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"fdjiEaJP785oKyYW"}

Their proud bastion, Coriolis station, became a place where the Firstcome groups, long isolated from each other, could meet, and interact with the newcomers, the Zenithians. Powerful groups that had up until now lacked both the incentive and the resources to communicate off-world now suddenly had both. Soon, the courts of Dabaran traded as much with the theocrats of Sadaal as they did with each other, all thanks to the Consortium, and convoys from Mira, packed with supplies from their rich home world, became a regular sight in both these systems. With travel suddenly accessible again, the traditional pilgrimages resurged, and holy sites such as Lotus and Dabaran, the Icon City on Mira and the Dome of the Icons on Coriolis were soon flooded with believers from every system. The Monolith, home of the Quassars, quickly joined the flow of commerce through its dominance over the booming economy on primitive Kua. Goods from the surface of the planet were transported up to Coriolis and unloaded for distribution on the Net – the spindly skeleton of the Zenith, orbiting Kua as a sister satellite to the space station.</p><h4>THE COUNCIL OF FACTIONS</h4><p>With the opening of the Horizon, other factions, less locally and more ideologically based, re-entered the stage. From their remote headquarters, possessing strange knowledge and mythical technology to back up their ideological strength, many factions and cults sent representatives to Coriolis. With few exceptions, they all bought seats on the station’s political council to try and influence the fragile, reborn Horizon to their factions' benefit. This became the foundation of the Council of Factions. The recent arrival of the Emissaries has brought the stability of the Council into question, and only time will tell how many of the faction members will continue to place their trust in its ability to keep the peace.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Zfn04B7UlP1EmRZI","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266682,"modifiedTime":1680376266682,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"JHNjQqC358FGGTXd","sort":0,"_id":"fw1rE7qVRmZB77ic"}

She provides them with some basic information and leaves after giving the group the call code to her communicator.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The Emissary’s residence is on the Abhrra floor in the Spire (see the Coriolis Core Rulebook, page 266 @JournalEntry[The Spire]), right on the slope by the waterfront. It is a three-storey building partly built into the hill with balconies made from green Miran marble and ornate Sadaalian granite archways, surrounded by smaller buildings, paths, orchards, and Kuan vines and trees. The main house is empty, save for three modestly furnished rooms and a balcony on the third floor facing the water. The front door is sealed and the judicators have changed the entrance codes to close off the area. Akouba leads the way and lets the PCs inside. You can use the following text as it is or as inspiration when you describe the house:</p><p><em>The apartment consists of three rooms and a small kitchen alcove. The kitchen is dusty and doesn’t appear to have been used in a long time. The bathroom is spotless and empty except for a few meticulously folded pairs of undergarments. The bedroom is perfectly ordered. The bed is made and a beautiful caftan hangs neatly folded over a chair next to it. The wardrobe contains about a dozen expensive, modern outfits complete with many layers of shawls and veils that the Emissary has been seen in when it has been captured on a Bulletin show or attended the Council. An exquisite hand fan lies next to the bed.</em></p><p><em>The sitting room is more interesting – there has clearly been fighting here: overturned furniture, a shattered music station, and torn books strewn across the floor. A mosaic depicting men and women descending from the Zenith to Kua covers most of one of the walls, but it is riddled with bullet holes – dotted black lines pointing toward a large pool of dark, dried blood on the floor. There are several other pools of blood and tracks that lead into the hallway – tracks made by bodies being dragged.</em></p><p>Judicator Akouba can provide the PCs with the information that the crime scene technicians have found, or you could let the PCs investigate on their own and let Akouba fill in the blanks afterward.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>In this scene, the PCs are expected to investigate the Emissary’s residence and combine their new findings with the clues they found in Act 1. Judicator Akouba makes herself available to the PCs so that she – in her capacity as an Astûrban agent – can tailor the leads to point more obviously toward the martyr strike team, and by extension – the Order of the Pariah. She is also there to make sure none of the other factions become suspects, especially not the Hegemony.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE RESIDENCE</h5><p>A small group has obviously managed to bypass the security systems in the Emissary’s residence and then leave the Abhrra again without being noticed, carrying at least one body. The PCs should have figured out this much before they leave the scene, and if they don’t find the clues themselves, let judicator Akouba give them the following information (as she has been instructed to do by ambassador Johar Quassar):</p><ul><li><strong>The Security System</strong>: Motion detectors and cameras covering the path outside the residence were disabled at the time of the break-in. In the basement, there is a security central for the entire complex where the PCs can investigate the system’s previously stored data. The last one to visit before the system was shut off was none other than the Zenithian Hegemony’s ambassador to the Council, Johar Quassar, and there is no footage of him leaving the residence. Akouba can inform the PCs that Johar Quassar has not been interviewed about the case yet as he has factionary immunity. See the info about the data meme below.</li><li><strong>The Blood</strong>: Fighting broke out in the residence and at least one person was injured. There is blood that can be analyzed in the next scene (Zalosian blood from five different individuals and Miran blood from one person). There are blood stains around the door, on some of the books on the floor, and in the colonnade outside (Zalosian). The prayer rug on the floor has a rather clear imprint of a bloody right hand (Miran).</li><li><strong>The Weapons</strong>: The weaponry used in the house consisted of Vulcan carbines (which can be determined by examining the hole patterns in the mosaic by testing command normally, or observation at –1). The damage to some of the books on the floor appears to come from the vibrating blade of a dura weapon. If the PCs noticed the fake guards' weapons in the opening scene in the spaceport, they should be able to connect the dots by now.</li></ul><p>In** addition to the above, you should make sure that the PCs have found at least one of the following clues before the scene ends**:</p><ul><li><strong>The Vulcan Bullet</strong>: One of the holes in the mosaic contains a bullet that is intact enough to be examined in the next scene. The rifling pattern on the bullet shows that the bullet was handmade by a gunsmith from a duramite/copper alloy to create almost noiseless vibro ammunition. This kind of bullet is not available on the open market and not produced by any of the Consortium companies, but is rather popular among rebels and shady weapon dealers.</li><li><strong>The Cracks</strong>: The walls around the door in the sitting room as well as parts of the floor around several of the pools of blood are shot through with a fine mesh of tiny cracks. The cracks seem to emanate from a point on the floor near the door and disappear a few meters from the prayer rug before reaching the mosaic on the wall. It looks almost as if the cracks have been caused by concentrated soundwaves (see the description of the attack below and of the Emissary’s mystic powers).</li><li><strong>The Data Meme</strong>: Investigating the surveillance and alarm systems will show that they were disabled by a locally introduced data meme. Passing a hard (–2) data djinn test reveals that the code appears to resemble the memes used on the Order’s monastery cruisers, and thus appears to be of Zalosian origin.</li></ul><h4>THE EMISSARY</h4><p>It is important that the PCs don’t find out too much about the life of the Emissary, but you could give them something – be mindful not to confuse them however.</p><ul><li>The Bowls: In the midst of the chaos in the sitting room, there are four overturned bowls on the floor – one with water, one with incense that has burned the rug on the floor, one with couscous and one with a small candle. The four bowls are religious symbols used in a prayer ritual. PCs who are preachers, come from Algol or Mira, or who have the Faction Standing: The Church of the Icons talent will know this with no dice rolls needed – otherwise they must pass a culture test where each bonus success will provide an additional clue about the bowls (see The Four Transformations). This clue says nothing about the attackers, but hints at the Emissary’s faith sharing roots with that of the Firstcome of the Third Horizon.</li><li>The Books: The book collection now strewn across half the room is made up of holy scriptures, legends, and songs from many of the Third Horizon’s original settlers or from old nomad swarms. There are books from almost all known systems and several of them where written during the golden age before the Portal Wars. Such books are rarities that aren’t given away, and only someone with impressive influence could ever hope to buy one.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE FOUR TRANSFORMATIONS</h4><p>The four bowls most likely represent the four spiritual transformations, or “elements”, although using physical objects is rare:</p><ul><li><strong>Algol</strong>: Physical representations of the four transformations are mainly found in prayer towers, common in the Algol system. The lowest, passive form (couscous as life from the earth) is the base from which the other forms spring; first the reactive form (water as life in motion), then the active and social form (a candle representing the fiery intensity and necessity of human relations) and finally intellect as the crowning stage (burning incense representing the whirling movement of free thought).</li><li><strong>Mira</strong>: Miran art uses a wider variety of euphemisms for the different stages. Different natural phenomena are common, as are animals. Stone, minerals, gems, and metals represent the first stage, plants represent the reactive stage as they can only respond to their surroundings, and animals are portrayed as social agents, interacting with the world and each other. Mankind has intelligence and free will and therefore a moral responsibility. However, humans can – through wrongful actions and thoughts – learn to accept a lower form of existence and blame the consequences of their actions on circumstances. Accepting the weight of one’s free will is a constant struggle. These ideas are present in all Miran art, architecture, painting, poetry, and theater.</li><li><strong>Ahlam’s Temple</strong>: The faction Ahlam’s Temple also adheres to the ideas of the four transformations, and they form a theme recognizable through the faction’s eight temple dances, one for each for the eight visible Icons.</li><li><strong>The Circle of Seekers</strong>: The Circle’s followers use the transformations as a representation of life and death: first comes the skeleton, at the core of every human being, and after that comes blood, body heat, and lastly breath. Death is life in reverse: the person stops breathing, grows cold, stiffens and begins to rot. The skeleton is broken down and only stardust remains. The four bowls as representations are not used by the Seeker cult.</li></ul></div><h4>THE EMISSARY’S RESIDENCE</h4><p>Beautiful skylights with cubist mosaics paint kaleidoscopic rainbows on the white floors. Brush strokes of blood on the walls disrupt the symmetry. The stairs leading up from the hallway hint at the chaos further in.</p><p>The Emissary’s residence is located on the Abhrra floor, right on the slope by the man-made lake. The residence is a three-room apartment in a large, luxury complex reserved solely for the Emissary by the Council. The surrounding buildings are also kept empty. Narrow paths run between the buildings, allowing for passage on foot or by palanquin only. The main house is reached through a semi-covered, sandstone gallery with klefsi vines on trellises climbing up to form a ceiling. The fallen leaves form a soft blue carpet around the door.</p>@JournalEntry[The Emissary's Residence Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> VISITING AN ICON</h5><p>When the Emissary on Coriolis spends time in its residence, it devotes itself to meditation or self-education about society in the Third Horizon since the Wars. Apart from the full-body clothes worn by the Emissary outside of the house, it asks for very few material possessions. During the year at the station, the Emissary has studied legends and songs from the holy scriptures of the nomad swarms and the Firstcome societies to try to find connections to the first two Horizons that could explain the current political intrigues. A large mosaic of Kua and the Zenith covers one of the walls, put there by the Consortium as a reminder of Zenithian might and the light they brought to the isolated Third Horizon. The sitting room contains a high-end music station linked to the Bulletin’s vast audio archives. The bathroom, bedroom, and kitchen are practically unused and all cupboards and shelves are empty. In the middle of the sitting room, between the mosaic and the music station, is a large prayer rug, woven according to the traditions of the mogul nomads from the Quadrant of the Pillar. This is where the Emissary studies, meditates, and sleeps. There is a small stool by the rug on which there usually sit four small bowls, containing water, incense, couscous, and a candle. The room is otherwise empty.</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SIGNS OF STRUGGLE</h5><p>You can let the PCs test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">science</strong> or <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> to find out the following information, or you could have judicator Akouba tell them what the forensic team has figured out so far, depending on how the players investigate the scene:</p><ul><li>The blood is from six different people. Akouba says that biocode analysis is underway.</li><li>The bullets in the wall are soundless vibro shots from Vulcan weapons.</li><li>No bodies have been found.</li><li>The surveillance systems covering the surrounding paths and the gallery outside were disabled before the attack began. The last one to visit the Emissary before the systems were shut down is none other than Johar Quassar, ambassador of the Zenithian Hegemony. Security was disconnected during the ambassador’s visit. The ambassador has not been interviewed yet as he has factionary immunity.</li><li>The kidnappers have left the Abhrra level without being picked up by any other active surveillance systems, such as those by the vertilane station.</li></ul><p>Other than the above, the PCs could find more clues that reveal further details about the attack or about the Emissary. Let them use science, observation, culture, or relevant experiences from their backgrounds to find more clues. Examining a clue more closely can also reveal more information, but this might take until the next scene – see the Important Facts above for details about the clues in the scene.<br />Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE KIDNAPPING IN DETAIL</h4><p>To give you as the GM a better understanding of the crime scene, the kidnapping is described in detail below. The description also hints at some of the Emissary’s mystical powers, such as its ability to manipulate sound waves.</p><ul><li><strong>The Strike Team</strong>: One of Salamah ach-Abaud’s s squads of warriors leave the base in the Cellar after lengthy preparations. The commandos enter the Spire via a secret passage leading directly to the Abhrra.</li><li><strong>False Support</strong>: Not knowing that the martyr strike team is being manipulated by the Zenithian Hegemony through spy chief Lenove Astir, Salamah accepts the help offered by Johar Quassar who makes sure that the security systems are turned off for the attack. The strike team is also unaware that Astir has made sure that the meme used can be traced back to the Order.</li><li><strong>The Attack</strong>: Five members of the Warriors of the Holy Light enter the Emissary’s residence through the main door. The Emissary has seen a vision of the attack and is prepared, so as the door opens, three of the attackers are hit by a powerful sonic blast – a high frequency scream beyond human hearing that pounds organs, shatters eardrums, and breaks bone, marble, and stone. Two of the warriors are thrown sideways across the room and the third backwards out into the gallery.</li><li><strong>Mind Over Matter</strong>: The two unharmed warriors open fire with their Vulcan carbines against the Emissary who stands calmly on the rug in the middle of the room. The first salvo of the silent vibro rounds are pushed away from the target as the air in the room begins to vibrate. The stray shots hit the mosaic and knock over a few of the book piles. The guns quiet and the two attackers pale as they watch their hands turn the guns toward each other – forced by the will of the Emissary who has taken a few steps toward them. Shots are fired and the two warriors stagger out of the apartment, severely wounded.</li><li><strong>For the Martyr</strong>: The martyr warriors have minds of steel and two of those wounded in the Emissary’s initial attack spring from the ground again, blood running from their noses, ears, and a myriad of tiny cuts. One of them charges at the Emissary with a dura knife. Several of the holy texts on the floor suddenly float up to form a swirling shield around the Emissary, withstanding the warrior’s ferocious attacks.</li><li><strong>Wounding an Icon</strong>: The Emissary’s head suddenly twitches and slumps forward – it looks down at the hilt of a dura knife sticking out from its chest through the dark blue cape. The second warrior who got back up after the sonic attack stands in the corner of the room, now with empty hands.</li><li><strong>Overwhelmed</strong>: The warrior who threw the knife approaches the Emissary and fires several shots with a stun gun into its neck, after which it collapses to the floor. It grabs at the edge of the rug with a bloody hand and kicks over the stool with the Miran bowls as it falls.</li><li><strong>The Kidnapping</strong>: Two of the martyr warriors now have gunshot wounds, two have been badly damaged by the sonic pulse and one lies dead in the gallery outside the door, killed by brain haemorrhages caused by the sound waves. The four survivors put the Emissary in a bag with grav units attached to it, collect their dead comrade and leave the scene. They use the Abhrra floor’s air vents and maintenance shafts to get back down to the Cellar through the hull of the Spire. The group lose their dead brother in the ventilation shafts and the two warriors with gunshot wounds seek out the Samaritan Sanatorium for emergency care under Brother Ramas and Sister Robwah. The last two survivors bring the Emissary to their base in the Cellar.</li></ul></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESONANCE – CHILDREN OF THE SONG</h5><p>A mystic PC will feel uneasy as soon as she enters the Emissary’s residence. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and the PC experiences a migraine-like episode, with heavy pressure over the temples and forehead and spotty vision. Non-mystic PCs feel nothing.</p><ul><li>The affected mystic PC must pass a demanding (–1) mystic powers test or suffer 2 mind points of stress. She can feel her heart racing as if she is about to have a panic attack, lasting until she leaves the Abhrra.</li><li>If she passes the test, she will hear the echo of a song – a repeating series of notes that appear to come from the music station’s speakers. If someone in the group thinks of analyzing the radiowaves in the room (technology –1) with the proper gear, they will pick up a weak but curious pattern of high frequency radio waves. This is the echo caused by the Emissary’s use of its powers, although that is unknown to the PCs. It is also the same sound pattern as any mystic PCs might have heard at the end of Act 1.</li></ul><p>Cost: 1 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"q2iecanzRk5qyLRh","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296955,"modifiedTime":1682695296955,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"UTesa86R9Yc5tKiL","sort":0,"_id":"g4eOwHNVPRP73cKm"}

From the outside, it looks like any other portal station, a lonely chunk of dark metal and flashing lights, covered in docked ships of various shapes and sizes. Inside, the rundown corridors and dim-lit halls are rife with intrigue, adventures and danger. Onboard the station, a power-hungry colonial agent, a paragon of the people, and an infiltrator are fast approaching a crisis and showdown. Welcome to Hamurabi, an outpost of civilization in the vast nothingness of space.</h3><p><strong>Hamurabi</strong> is the only station in the Hamura system, and thus a natural stop for jumpers from Kua headed for the Dabaran circle. Hamurabi is located between the two portal fields and is visited by ships going in both directions, a common solution in systems with little traffic. Portal station Hamurabi is an open sector and an archetypal portal station in the Third Horizon.</p><p>The station orbits the Hamura star and the two portal fields are approximately 1 AU from the station in opposite directions. The closest planet to the station is the mining moon Abui, orbiting the gas giant Nestero. Abui passes Hamurabi at a distance of 3 AUs every three segments.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/epilogue/Hamurabistationen03_fri.webp\" /></div><h4>Overview</h4><p>Like most portal stations of this model, Hamurabi’s aesthetics are simple and practical, except in the core of the station, where rose windows filter multi-colored light across dark carpets, and the smell of food from the cantina creates a homely atmosphere. Rooms and residential modules are often decorated with colorful textiles and religious items such as small altars, candles, prayer towers with burning incense and exquisitely engraved reliquaries. The chapel onboard is also an oasis of peace and beauty in a world otherwise dominated by steel, glass and rubber. Outside of the core, halls and corridors are often poorly lit, and whole sections sometimes go dark altogether (a problem blamed on parasitic organisms from Abui).</p><p>The Hamurabi station is treated as an ordinary environment in regards to tech availability and prices (see Chapter 6 of the Coriolis core rulebook).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Facts about Hamurabi</h4><ul><li><strong>Population</strong>: 131 permanent residents, plus between fifty and one hundred hands working the ice mines, and some free traders, prospectors and colonists. No semi-intelligences or slummers.</li><li><strong>Physical data</strong>:  Roughly 600 meters wide and 280 meters long.</li><li><strong>Law and order</strong>:  A company of twenty hired guards (see the table in the Characters and Creatures section for their game stats) keeps the peace under the leadership of Commander Alsha Bashir, who in turn answers to Station chief Rhavinn Bokor of the Foundation. Bashir and Bokor handle petty crime and punishment, but more serious criminal activity is delegated to the courts on Coriolis.</li><li><strong>Governance</strong>: The station is run by the Consortium, mainly through the Foundation’s station chief, responsible for the portal field analyses sold to passing ships. The Colonial Agency is also present onboard to maintain contact with the scattered colonies in the system, as is the Bulletin, running mail service and the news probes</li></ul></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Docks and landing platforms</h5><p>The station has twelve docks and two platforms for smaller craft (classes I through III) as well as four docks for larger vessels (class IV). Hamurabi is a standard space station, and service costs here are normal (±0 modifier). The docking fee is included in the service cost (see p 155 of the Rulebook).</p><p>Overzealous port bureaucrat Asal Harub keeps his unclean offices next to the landing platforms. He is very serious about his job, and will not hesitate to demand access to ship logs or even to be allowed onboard to search the PCs' ship if he thinks something looks suspicious.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Weapons on the station</h5><p>Anyone can carry weapons on the station, but if the PCs should choose to walk around with visible guns and armor they are sure to attract attention, and eventually the gaze of Commander Bashir. He has no problem with a holstered Vulcan pistol, but would rather see heavier weapons and armor kept onboard the PCs' ship. Defying the commander on this issue will result in immediate expulsion from the station.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  The souk</h5><p>The circular plaza at the top of the station is its heart. It has a diameter of about seventy meters and is filled with all sorts of businesses, from junk shops and food stalls to workshops and tech stores. The available merchandise is somewhat limited, but most ordinary tech can be found here. Brahani’s and several other cantinas surround the souk, most of them just holes in the wall. The Icon chapel and the offices of the Bulletin can also be found here, and a short corridor connects the plaza to the medlab. In a corner of the souk, Khabaran Nazim is running a small contract agency for freelancers (see p 215 of the Rulebook).</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Centrumsal.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The medlab</h5><p>The portal station is equipped with a medlab, ruled firmly by Chief Medicurg Lumara Akbion. She is mainly interested in the most serious cases, and lets her two assistants tend to the other patients.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Brahani’s</h5><p>The largest cantina onboard the station. The clientele is anything but picky and holds the food and drink of Brahani’s to be of excellent quality. When station management or other important guests visit the cantina, Nia Brahani and her three employees bring out the special reserve to serve delicate food and beverages, although the limited supply of raw materials sometimes makes the combinations a bit interesting. The prices of these specialty dishes are steep, deterring common folk from ordering them, which helps to maintain their exclusivity. Nia is always interested in new faces, and knows just about everything about the station and its inhabitants. She can tell the PCs how to approach the station akbar, the colonial agent, the Bulletin journalist and the preacher.</p><p>Brahani’s is open during the morning, day and evening watches, but closes during the night. There are always at least a few guests here: in the morning it is mostly stevedores sharing a hookah, some kawah or a samovar of chai before a long day of work begins; small groups of administrative employees usually arrive during the day, and in the evening it is not uncommon for station management or other prominent faces to show up, such as Medicurg Akbion or Talib the preacher. The final hours before closing belong to the younger members of the station’s administration, centered on colonial agent Yasitra Hur and the Bulletin’s Anata Garam. The occasional prospector or visiting colonist might show up at any time of the day, but they usually don’t fit in too well because clothing, behavior and level of intoxication.</p><p>The cantina’s main attraction is Emira the dancer and her white, bionic snake, spellbinding her audience one night a week. Mean rumors say that the fiery Emira is having a secret affair with Yasitra Hur, the pompous colonial agent.</p><p>When the hands of the Abui ice mines are on leave, Brahani’s is transformed from a tasteful watering hole to a rowdy and violent place, disturbing the otherwise calm life of the station.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Sleeping Ekilibri’s coffin hostel</h5><p>A somewhat decent coffin hostel for visitors who desire peace and quiet after a stressful voyage. Simple but cheap.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Akbar’s residence</h5><p>Station chief Rhavinn Bokor’s residence bears a strong resemblance to the Museum of History on Coriolis, and is located in a cylindrical tower almost reaching to the ceiling of the souk. The walls of Mister Bokor’s relatively spacious home are covered in relics and trinkets from all corners of the Horizon. Most visitors granted a little of the Akbar’s time only get to see the audience chamber, which is a large, circular room with a low table in the middle. Prominent guests are entertained at the table, but visitors of less importance are shown to small sitting cushions along the walls. Two wide panoramic windows show the darkness of space on one side and the commotion of the souk on the other. Mister Bokor’s scribe and assistant, Naaji, is present during all audiences.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The offices of the Bulletin</h5><p>Bulletin correspondent Anata Garam’s combined post office and newsroom. Deliveries bound for the fringes of the system come through here, and captains stopping at the station often check the info terminals at the docks to see if there are any mail runs for their destinations available. Courier work is often easy money in Hamura. Anata Garam and colonial agent Yasintra Hur handle deliveries for the outer colonies collaboratively. The two young careerists can often be found together at Brahani’s in their spare time. Anata’s offices are worth a visit for crews looking for courier work. Hauling goods or information from here to Kua or elsewhere provides decent pay.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  The Chapel of the Icons</h5><p>Preacher Talib Ogor runs the station’s simple but beautiful chapel. Together with two apprentices – stevedore Nala and administrator Bilal – Ogor runs the chapel and tends to most of the station’s spiritual needs. Most residents visit at least once per segment. The outgoing preacher is always present at social events around the station, and can often be found at Brahani’s, where he takes his dinner with Rhavinn Bokor.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The offices of the Colonial Agency</h5><p>Colonial agent Yasintra Hur’s offices are located just off Landing Platform Two. From here, she and her two staff members register new claims and colonies. Together with Anata Garam of the Bulletin, Yasintra makes sure that the colonists of the system get their mail and deliveries.  Hur and Garam can often be seen together as they have much in common – they are both young women with big dreams for the future who have accepted the posting to Hamurabi as a necessary step to ensure professional advancement.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/hamurabi_layout.webp\" /></div><h4>The situation</h4><p>Hamurabi is your average Third Horizon portal station. It is mainly a place where bored crews can wait for bulk haulers with which to jump to Kua, but it is also home to a small group of permanent residents, either operating the station or working on small-scale research projects. To the colonists and prospectors in Hamura, the station is their oasis, both socially and practically – it is where they restock their supplies, catch up on the happenings of the Horizon and purchase spare parts and new machinery. The mail and courier services of the system are based on Hamurabi.</p><p>Under the sleepy exterior of daily life on the station, tensions are running high. The power games of the factions influence the entire Horizon, causing bad blood between the stationaries and the hands on Hamurabi. A few of these conflicts are described below.</p><p>After the Taoan incident (see page 184 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[The Horizon Today]), Hamurabi has rapidly become more and more isolated. Only a handful of prospectors and ice haulers bound for Abui pass the station these days.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Abui ice mines</h5><p>The closest world to Hamurabi is Abui, a moon orbiting the gas giant Nestero. The moon is home to a community of hired hands mining ice for the Colonial Agency. The ice from Abui is very valuable if delivered to the right buyer, and the Consortium have signed lucrative ice trading contracts with the pasha of Dar Bouti on Dabaran, among others. Abui passes relatively close to Hamurabi once every three segments, and the miners usually take this opportunity to visit the station, a veritable paradise in comparison to the dark mines. These visits are the cause of much conflict onboard. The permanent residents of Hamurabi are tired of the loud, well-paid miners wreaking havoc at Brahani’s and their other bars. The Free League’s representative on the station, Didier Abédi, is working tirelessly to improve the miners' abysmal labor conditions, but this struggle is not buying him any favors with the locals – the miners are well compensated for their dangerous work, and the stationaries are envious of their spending when on leave on the station. The Consortium’s people on the station have orders to make sure that the mines operate smoothly, and spend considerable resources to make sure that they do.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Abui, the mining moon</h4><p>On Abui, the Colonial Agency is mining ice for lucrative export to other worlds. The mine itself is an intricate system of tunnels running deep beneath the moon’s surface. The PCs might visit Abui because of some involvement in the intrigues on Hamurabi. On the surface of the moon there is a small loading dock, a control room and living quarters for the mining crew. The core of the moon is reached by fast mine cars on rails running through the tunnels. The ice is mined using massive crawlers equipped with mercurium drills. Sometimes, whole groups of miners disappear in the tunnels, and these incidents seem to be increasing in frequency. Is there something more than ice hiding in the dark heart of Abui?</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Samina’s corsairs</h5><p>Corsair captain Samina is infamous across the Third Horizon. With absolute precision and bold audacity, she attacks couriers and spare parts transports all over Hamura. Lately, her corsairs have also been targeting the popular cruise liners bound for the water planet Hamura.</p><p>The increasing boldness of the corsairs' raids could be the beginning of their downfall, however – powerful factionaries on Coriolis have begun questioning why nothing drastic is done about the corsair problem in the Hamura system. Station Akbar Bokor and colonial agent Hur are under increasing pressure to produce results in their fight against Samina.</p><h4>Characters and Creatures</h4><p>Hamurabi’s most important residents and generic NPCs such as hands and station guards are described in the table below.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Rhavinn Bokor, Station Akbar</div>@Actor[Rhavinn Bokor, Station Akbar]<div class=\"blueheader\">Yasintra Hur, colonial agent</div>@Actor[Yasintra Hur, Colonial Agent]<div class=\"blueheader\">Emira (Samina), Dancer and Corsair Captain</div>@Actor[Emira (Samina), Dancer and Corsair Captain]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Dansös.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">Didier Abédi, representative of the Free League</div>@Actor[Didier Abédi, Representative of the Free League]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Fackrepresentant.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">Lupino Mbia, colonial overseer</div>@Actor[Lupino Mbia, Colonial Overseer]<h4>Events</h4><p>The Hamurabi station is an excellent place for the GM to introduce new characters, plots and side stories. Crews travelling the Horizon generally spend quite a lot of time on portal stations waiting for jump coordinates or a bulk hauler to jump with.</p><p>Onboard the station, the PCs can rest, purchase new gear and look for new contracts or missions. It is not unusual for these micro-societies to teem with intrigue and conflicts for the PCs to get dragged into. A few examples are described below.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The welcoming committee</h5><p>When the PCs dock at Hamurabi, Asal Harub the bureaucrat approaches them accompanied by two guards. They demand to be let onboard for an inspection, as they have received an anonymous tip about the PCs being smugglers. Do they have anything to hide? Maybe one of the group’s enemies has bribed a station guard to plant incriminating evidence onboard?</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  The Bulletin</h5><p>Bulletin correspondent Anata Garam receives a tip about the PCs and takes an interest in them. She follows them around, digs around in their backgrounds for a scoop and even goes so far as to break into their ship to look for information. This is a perfect opportunity for the GM to hold the PCs accountable for poor judgment or morally questionable choices in previous adventures. Anata will not back down easily, but threats, blackmail or violence could force her to lay off.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Free League</h5><p>The Colonial Agency and the mining overseer have had enough of Didier Abédi’s interference in their business, and decide that the time has come for the League agent to suffer a little accident. Abédi becomes stuck in an airlock that suffers decompression, but manages to get into an exo and make it out alive. He suspects that the whole affair was arranged by someone, and hires the PCs to act as bodyguards and detectives. Overseer Lupino will not give up without a fight, and will think up a series of spectacular and creative ways to get rid of the agent. Meanwhile, Abédi asks the PCs to investigate the overseer and the colonial agent and to look for evidence of illegal activities. Perhaps this mission will lead the PCs to new adventures on Abui?</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CORSAIR PROBLEM</h5><p>Colonial agent Yasintra Hur has grown tired of her transports being raided by corsairs. She suspects that the corsairs receive information about transport routes from someone on the station – how else can they strike with such precision? Hur hires the PCs to poke around the station and try to find out who is leaking information to the corsairs. Among the suspects are Asal Harub, the bureaucrat, Commander Alsha Bashir and colonial overseer Lupino Mbia. Ironically enough, it is Yasintra herself who is the leak! Every now and then, she spends the night with Emira the dancer, who is actually corsair extraordinaire Samina in disguise, and has been working Hur for information for months!</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>mini adventure</h5><p>The event “The corsair problem”  is an excellent opportunity for a GM who wishes to send the PCs on a mini adventure. It will start with the PCs gathering evidence on Hamurabi to expose Samina and Yasintra. Samina might manage to escape, and if she does, Akbar Bokor will send the PCs after her, all the way to a secret smuggler hideout on the Gupka station orbiting the mysterious planet Yublai…</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Station01.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Mcys3ojvs6dLfF4C","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252436,"modifiedTime":1680376252436,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"yFT1eT1Pe5T86bOE","sort":0,"_id":"g5MlK7UC9NOnkw1T"}

The Church of the Icons are right in their supposition that the darkness only affects that which already exists: life, in all its multiplicity.

After a bumpy (crash) landing in the jungles, they run into the smugglers who have come to collect the stasis pods. This encounter brings the PCs to Baybasin where they find the smugglers' employer, Artyr Gholâm. Suddenly, the Shaukar guerilla attacks and in the midst of the fighting, the PCs realize that the pods are already en route to the Conglomerate. The hunt continues.</p><h4>KEY INSIGHTS</h4><p>When the PCs finally catch up with the smugglers and make it out of the jungles, they should have learned the following:</p><ul><li>The martyr strike team is not acting alone. Several groups, such as Ramses' Jackals, assist with transporting the kidnapped prisoners from Coriolis.</li><li>Not only mystics are smuggled down to Kua. Ordinary people have also been abducted and sent to the jungles.</li><li>The stasis pods are shipped to Little Algol in the Conglomerate via Verkâna Ridge to avoid faction import fees and customs inspections.</li><li>The martyr strike team members are now covering their tracks as they are finishing up their business with local contacts such as Artyr Gholâm.</li></ul><h4>IMPORTANT CHARACTERS</h4><ul><li><strong>@Actor[Ramses]</strong> – leader of the smuggler group Ramses’ Jackals (page 104)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Artyr Gholâm]</strong> – shipping akbar and smuggler hired by Salamah ach-Abaud (page 117)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Raquin Birbasil]</strong> – Syndicate representative and ruler of Baybasin (page 118)<br />INDEPENDENT CHARACTERS</li><li><strong>@Actor[Haquim] and @Actor[Aqueda]</strong> – scouts for the Shaukar guerilla shadowing the PCs (page 104)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Dali Osman]</strong> – officer in the Shaukar guerilla (page 119)</li></ul><h4>DARKNESS POINTS</h4><p>Darkness Points can be used to animate the jungles and make them a dangerous place, as well as to have the different antagonists in the scenario call for backup.

{"name":"The Faith of the People","flags":{"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true},"coriolis-corerules":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/10 - The People of the Horizon","noteRef":""},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-corerules.journalentry.65a8ebc1df602d80"}},"pages":[{"name":"The Faith of the People","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>To most of the Horizon’s inhabitants, the Icons are a real force to worship and placate in order for life to function. Many people have their own favorite Icon – one that has helped them through hard times or brought them luck. A sacrifice can be made to one’s favorite Icon before an important event that normally wouldn’t fall under that specific Icon’s general niche – praying too often to a multitude of Icons is said to bring bad luck and to nourish the Dark between the Stars. Common people believe that the Icons – contrary to the Church’s rhetoric – have more than one face, and are as prone to anger as they are to generosity. Sometimes, it can be wise to honor an Icon with offerings just to ward off its gaze. Take care not to treat the Judge this way however: the Judge is an Icon that doesn’t take kindly to false worship.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/spådom_mystik.webp\" /></div><p></p><div class=\"blueheader\">THE UGLY ONE</div><br />There is an old story about a peddler who tried to trick the Merchant in order to turn a greater profit. With offerings and wailing prayers he purported to be on the brink of financial ruin. This was a lie, and instead he made huge amounts of money selling the cargo that was bestowed upon him. The Merchant eventually found out and was very angry. A fire broke out on the peddler’s ship that destroyed half of his face. To this day, “The Ugly One” is said to be traveling the Horizon as a prophet, warning of the righteous wrath of the Icons.<p></p><h4>TABOOS</h4><p>There are many taboos in the Horizon, connected to the Icons’ vengeful tendencies. Certain things must not be done, or even mentioned – to speak of the Dark between the Stars is among the worst things one can do, for example. Instead, people use metaphors or euphemisms. Other taboos include certain foods, not showing generosity or hospitality, refusing to accept gifts, and speaking ill of the Icons.</p><h4>TALISMANS</h4><p>Believers often carry talismans representing their favorite Icon or the Church of the Icons. Talismans are holy items and are often miniature sculptures or portraits of the Icon or its symbol. Just like offerings, talismans can be bought in the street markets outside most temples and chapels. The Talisman Market in Icons City is known for its many different and exotic interpretations of the Icons. Many pilgrims wish to return from their pilgrimage with a talisman that has been blessed in the Dome of the Icons. For a talisman to have holy power, it must be blessed in a temple before the right Icon, accompanied by the proper offerings. The talismans are usually left in the temple for one whole day, and to take a talisman during this time is one of the strongest taboos in the Horizon. It is common for people to put their talismans back on the altar during religious festivals to recharge their holy power.</p><h4>ICONOSCOPES AND PROPHECIES</h4><p>For each of the Icons, there is a segment in the calendar and in the sky. The constellations of an Icon can vary between systems, as some of them are so far apart that the night sky shows different stars. It is widely accepted that Iconoscopes – descriptions of how the stars in the segment of one Icon or another interact with other stars along the ecliptic – can predict someone’s future. Iconoscopes are personal and centered on the most important Icon in someone’s life. Crafting an Iconoscope is a complex process with more exceptions than rules. The techniques vary between systems and cultures, and a sibyl or oracle from one system may have a difficult time trying to read the stars in another system. Making an Iconoscope for someone who didn’t ask for it is taboo, as is trying to read one’s own future. There are also methods of soothsaying that don’t involve the stars. Using an Icon deck to read the future in the cards drawn is one method, while arithmetic is popular on Dabaran. Arithmetic is the art of using unworldly numbers and algorithms to predict the future. The true mathematicians of Dabaran regard arithmetic with disdain, but the practice is in wide circulation on the planet.</p><h4>LOCAL ICONS</h4><p>Almost wherever you go, you will find local Icon variations not acknowledged by the Church or orthodox believers. In some systems, one Icon takes precedence over all others – such as the Martyr on Zalos – and in some places, important figures in society have been elevated to an almost god-like position, such as Iconocrat Aremerat on Sadaal for example. Certain primitive Firstcome tribes interpret elemental beings, strange phenomena, or wild spirits as Icons, of which the Azaäleans in the Kuan jungles, Ba-yinn the Star Snake or the Ouroboros all are examples. The Kandah cloud in the Rimward Reach and the winking pulsar outside of Algebar are both considered holy by nomads. Regardless of local customs, the nine Icons exist in every system, albeit under different names. Only in a few cases has a local Icon replaced one of the original nine – an important ancestor, some lesser deity or even a spirit or djinn. In the Yastapol system, Ekaterina, a dead malika, has replaced the Judge. Ekaterina represents justice, but also fertility.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"ub4EfHHbOEaV55Rk","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266493,"modifiedTime":1680376266493,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"geRQYyMY0cI8Akvb"}

They then visit the Souk Habra where they might end up caught in the crossfire between armed slummers and the Nestera defense forces.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs’ barge enters Little Algol and moors at Pier 58 in the Khabal district. This is where – according to the manifest and potential witnesses – all of Artyr’s previous shipments have been sent for redistribution. A pillar of smoke can be seen nearby, and the PCs soon find its source: Artyr’s warehouses. Someone got here before them.</p><p>The scene is open and takes place on Pier 58, in the Khabal slums, on the floating Souk Habra, and along the Little Algol beaches. As the GM, you are free to tailor the scene to fit your group. The PCs should be getting busy following up on leads found in the first act, as well as new ones uncovered during the scene. Artyr’s manifest points toward Tubra Ghutan and the Hassam shipping company. The stevedores employed to unload the pods on Pier 58 are being killed one by one however, and the desperate survivors have gone into hiding.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> QUID PRO QUO</h5><p>The PCs’ actions in Baybasin have most likely made considerable local impact. If they require aid in their search for the stasis pods, they could contact their new Conglomerate allies – either the Birbasils or Shaukar sympathizers within Yjala Bakou’s slummer brigade.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A LITTLE HELP FROM ABOVE</h5><p>The PCs may also wish to contact judge Kurahan or judicator Kosha. Both will be careful not to have their names officially connected with any of the drama surrounding the attack on the martyr strike team’s base or its aftermath – the Council of Factions is in turmoil and there is plenty of potentially career-ending blame to go around – but judge Kurahan is very eager for an update on the investigation. If they contact her, the PCs will receive the following reply:</p><p>“Continue the investigation no matter the costs. We are onto something much bigger than just the whereabouts of the mystics. The missing nightingale must be found – without its song, all is lost.”</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>When the PCs arrive, they are immediately pulled into the intrigue surrounding the deaths of Artyr’s associates in Little Algol. Their clues from Act I tie in with new information uncovered in the scene.</p><ul><li><strong>The Manifest</strong>: The shipping manifest names Tubra Ghutan, the Hassam shipping company and the Souk Habra.</li><li><strong>The Shipping Company</strong>: The Hassam offices are located in the middle of the Souk Habra and are run by Niobe Hassam.</li><li><strong>Murder Victims</strong>: Several people involved with handling the stasis pods have recently been murdered.</li><li><strong>The Survivor</strong>: Tubra Ghutan is a foreman with Hassam and has gone into hiding at a nearby bathhouse after the incident at Pier 58 and the attack on Niobe Hassam.</li><li><strong>The Stasis Units</strong>: Tubra knows that the stasis units are transported to Leod dol-Quassar’s palace in Dignitary City.</li></ul><p>It is important for the PCs to find Tubra alive so that they may hear about Leod’s palace.</p><h4>THE KHABAL DOCKS</h4><p>The docks on the northeastern shores of the Ramishah are bustling with life. The view of the docks with their sixty-meter-long piers embracing the enormous Souk Habra is a somewhat impressive sight. A multitude of trading offices and customs houses are located on or next to the piers. The narrow streets are packed with people. Gang members, peddlers, faqirs, musicians, acrobats, beggars, and carriers mingle with prophets and seers loudly sharing their wisdom with the people. The air is thick with the smell of cooking, spices, sewage, incense, soap, and burning bones.</p><p>The Khabal district houses Little Algol’s docks, a hub for much of the river traffic going further into the Conglomerate. Since the flooding of the Mibea factory island, the Khabal docks are also used for the redistribution of cargo from incoming river barges to hovercraft – or, in many cases, the backs of hands – for transportation to the Souk Habra or the markets in Ara-Ara via Dignitary City. The increase in commercial traffic through the area has made bandit attacks more frequent. The hovercraft have begun forming convoys to reduce risks, which has resulted in fewer but more focused bandit raids.</p><p>The Syndicate, primarily through the Birbasil and Rafa families, maintain a heavy presence in Little Algol and have infiltrated all levels of society.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><p><em>“They think they are the masters. That their white towers are the ones ruling Kua.</em></p><p><em>But they are just dried corpses under a merciless sun. They are already dead.\"</em><br />Yjala Bakou, Freedom Fighter</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PIER 58</h5><p>Where the green waters of the Ramishah first meet the debris and filth of the Little Algol shantytowns, we find the piers – jetties on piles held together by frayed ropes and old chains. Both river barges and small canoes moor here to unload their cargo at the pier warehouses awaiting further transportation. Pier 58 is on the edge of the docks, a massive jungle wood construction housing two warehouses.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FIRE!</h5><p>The pillar of smoke is visible from far away, accompanied by the nauseating smell of fire. Pier 58 now houses two smoldering ruins instead of its warehouses and several of the moored watercraft nearby have also been destroyed. Stevedores are putting out the last flames as the PCs arrive and the local slummers have already started to gather, hoping to plunder the ruins.</p><h4>THE SOUK HABRA</h4><p>The Khabal river markets, the Souk Habra, are busy and chaotic. The local vendors often live in, or close to, their shacks or stalls. Slippery pontoons and rotting jetties connect the different platforms, but paying a gondolier to take you where you need to go is usually quicker as the markets are crowded around the clock. A slow-moving mass of merchants, customers, hands, and palanquin carriers fill every street and alley and the noise can some days be almost deafening. Beggars sing hymns to passersby while shaking their cups in the hopes of a few birr. Pickpocketing is a booming and relatively safe business, as a quick leap into the water usually saves the thief the trouble of getting arrested even if she is spotted in the act.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>CYCLADE CELEBRATIONS</h4><p>At the beginning of In the Footsteps of the Martyr, the recommended date was nine days before the start of the new year. Preparations for the Cyclade were well underway onboard Coriolis, although the mysticides and the disappearance of the Emissary ruined the holiday spirit for much of the station’s population. On Kua however, most are unaware of what has been going on in orbit, and this cycle’s celebrations will be as lively as ever. Tarrabs and traveling circus groups perform in even the smallest neighborhoods and enormous amounts of food are being prepared for the annual feast. Unless the PCs have wasted time and missed the Cyclade, the celebrations might coincide with their stay in Little Algol.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HASSAM OFFICE</h5><p>At the heart of the Souk Habra, a few larger pontoons float next to each other, forming a stable center known as Panee Plaza. A group of shacks and houseboats contain the warehouses of wholesale spice merchants Lamsha, the Kaltash Amim brewery – famed officially for their fruit wine, but equally so for their secret, opor-based products – and the office of the Hassam shipping company. The entrance to Hassam is anonymous and easy to miss – only a small hexagonal stained glass window faces the street next to a narrow door with no sign above it. Hassam’s warehouses at the docks are rented out to the highest bidder and they also supply their clients with reliable stevedore crews. The company have no boats or hovercraft of their own, instead preferring to rent space onboard barges or in the convoys to Ara-Ara.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/lillaalgol.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> HAMAM TAMINA</h5><p>The Hamam Tamina can be found at the edge of the Souk Habra, near Dignitary City. Merchants who have had a good day at the markets flock to Tamina’s, as well as wealthy tourists from near and far. In the golden age of Dignitary City, when Little Algol grew to become a district of its own and not just a nameless part of Ara-Ara, this used to be a bathhouse for diplomats and royalty. Today, none of its former customers would dare to cross the dangerous slums to get here, but Tamina has managed to find a new clientele base among the upper classes of Little Algol.</p><p>The building is constructed around an atrium with a mosaic skylight in the middle depicting the constellations in the night sky above the Icon City on Mira. The soft light from above makes the shallow pools below shine like silver, illuminating a beautiful Deckhand statue in the middle. The statue is of a small child with short hair hunched over a stone bowl with a rag in its hand, as if just about to polish the surface of the water. Both the statue and the walls of the atrium are covered in lush, green vines.</p><p>Tamina receives all new visitors in person and remembers the face of everyone who has ever bathed here. Already on your second visit, she will greet you by name, offer you your favorite kawah, and ask how that aunt of yours back on Algol is doing. For about the price of a night out, she supplies you with fresh towels, soap, and a copper washbowl after which one of her employees guides you to a room referred to by the regulars as the Water Temple – a room with high ceilings on fluted columns where small waterfalls shoot from cracks in the walls high above. The next room in is the steam sauna, followed by the central bath chamber with its three larger pools and corridors leading to private rooms where a more intimate bath experience is offered, along with rose tea and massages, for a few extra birr. These back rooms are where trade agreements are finalized, marriages negotiated, and deals struck. When you leave, your clothes are freshly washed and ironed and Tamina wishes you the Icons’ grace with a conspiratorial wink.</p><h4>LIVING IN THE SHADOW OF THE MONOLITH</h4><p>A common misconception is that the Conglomerate is an eternal city spanning most of Kua’s equator, but this is not the case. The city is actually not that big – the residential districts, factory islands, and slums cover large areas, yes, but are mostly made up of abandoned and forgotten buildings slowly being reclaimed by the jungles. Countless rivers snake their way through the urban wasteland and are used as roads for most of the local trade. The buildings in the Conglomerate range from enormous skyscrapers to low, hangar-like warehouses and decrepit shantytowns. As one gets closer to the Monolith, jungles and farmlands are replaced by outposts, ruins, factory islands, and estates, which in turn eventually give way to residential districts and the splendor of Covenant City (see page 288 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[The Monolith]).</p>@JournalEntry[The Monolith and Surroundings Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DISTRICTS AND FACTORY ISLANDS</h5><p>There is a fair amount of confusion going around as to what distinguishes a factory island from a residential district, but the only ones who really care are probably the Zenithian bureaucrats and corporations as business permits differ between the two types of zone classification. A factory island usually houses countless manufacturing units and workers’ barracks, and there is often a tall tower somewhere on the island where the company or family who owns the factories have their headquarters. Beautiful gardens, ornate balconies, and impressive mosaic walls usually surround the central offices, in stark contrast to the simple exterior of the factories.</p><p>Residential districts – usually referred to as just districts – are often more a mix between apartment buildings, shantytowns, tent camps, and factories. Smaller companies tend to operate here rather than on the islands, owning or renting a single factory. Businesses run by “free” hands are also common here.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NATURE’S MIGHT</h5><p>The Conglomerate is not miraculously shielded from nature’s wrath, despite popular beliefs to the contrary. When the yearly monsoon comes sweeping in from the Gyrides ocean south of the equator, large parts of the delta around which much of the city is constructed risk flooding. Gigantic dams – called the Cataracts – keep the waters at bay, but should they fail, whole districts and islands could be swept away. The latest Cataract failure happened during the Mibea offensive where the flooding of Lake Ytamara enabled the Nestera defense forces to halt the Queen Slummer’s advancing armies. Word on the street is that Nestera intentionally opened Cataract 7, not caring about the countless innocent lives lost in the process. The monsoons are not the only natural hazard in the area. Wild storms, stronger than hurricanes, sometimes strike without warning. Much of the higher levels of the districts are destroyed and abandoned, or undergoing constant repairs.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CIVIL UNREST</h5><p>oth in the Khabal shantytowns and in the Souk Habra, the hottest topic is currently Yjala Bakou, the “Queen Slummer”. Rumors have it that more and more cells supporting her rebellion are forming. The Nestera defense forces have blocked off Bakou’s route to Ara-Ara, and as a result, her movement is expanding in Little Algol instead. The conflict between Nestera and the slummers is visible everywhere around the Khabal docks. The fighting has intensified over the last few weeks, largely due to a recent influx of cheap firearms. The recruiters for the armed slummer resistance are targeting younger and younger age groups, some of the new fighters barely more than kids. Nestera fights fire with fire and has begun staging public executions of accused Bakou fighters, despite claims of innocence and only circumstantial evidence. Voices are being raised saying that it has all gone too far, but neither side seems to be willing to listen.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>During the scene, the PCs will encounter slummer fighters and the Nestera defense forces. The number of combatants on either side is left to the GM to decide. The PCs should also be able to track down a survivor from Hassam from whom they can get more information about the deliveries to Leod dol-Quassar.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Bakou's Fighters]</li><li>@Actor[Nestera Defense Forces]</li><li>@Actor[Tubra Ghutan]</li><li>@Actor[Ataia]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>The events in the scene are mostly optional, but the first – Arrival – and the last – The Last Pallbearer – should be regarded as more or less mandatory. The first event establishes the threat against potential witnesses and leads the PCs to begin their search for hidden survivors, and the last event describes the meeting with Tubra Ghutan. The goal of the scene is for the PCs to find someone who can tell them that the stasis pods are being taken to Leod dol-Quassar’s palace in Dignitary City. The events listed as Investigative contain important clues.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARRIVAL</h5><p>Pier 58 is bustling with activity. The smoldering ruins of two warehouses sit there as reminders of a terrible fire just prior to the PCs’ arrival. The fire was the work of Ataia, the Order’s agent, who placed two firebombs on the pier set to go off just as the Hassam carrier crew were to transport the latest shipment of abducted prisoners to Leod dol-Quassar’s palace. Dark smoke hangs over the pier and charred pieces of wood and plastic float around in the water.</p><ul><li><strong>Artyr on the Run</strong>: If Artyr managed to escape Baybasin, the PCs will find his boat sunk just next to the pier. Inside, in the dark, waterfilled engine room, they also find Artyr with his throat cut. Getting to the body requires a successful dexterity test.</li><li><strong>Charred Ruins</strong>: The warehouses appear to have been empty at the time of the fire. A strong scent of ammonia can be smelled if the collapsed doors are pried open (force). An enamel sign on the door displays the logo of the Hassam company, matching the one found on Artyr’s manifest. Moving around inside the still burning building requires a dexterity test. Failure means fire damage (D6 damage first turn, then Fire (D6) for two turns or until the victim or someone within Close range successfully tests dexterity). Alternatively, the PCs may attempt to put out the fire before entering (dexterity –2), after which they can examine the ruins without the risk of injury.</li><li><strong>The Stasis Pod</strong>: Closer examination reveals that the warehouses are not completely empty after all. Under the debris, a tank of some sort is leaking an unknown liquid that contributes to the strong smell of ammonia. A successful technology test reveals the container to be a broken tank of coolant liquid for a stasis unit, and at the back of the room, the PCs find a cracked and blackened stasis pod with a burned body inside, twisted in agony.</li><li><strong>The Bodies</strong>: A successful observation test lets the PCs find two additional bodies nearby. Two stevedores got trapped inside the burning building and fought each other for what they believed to be the safety of the stasis unit. The winner stabbed her coworker, emptied out the thawing body from the pod on the floor and climbed in, unaware of her imminent and terrible fate – she was boiled alive in stasis fluid minutes later. The stab victim crawled away and bled out behind some crates nearby. Both workers appear to be Sogoi. One of them has a tag with a week’s wages on it (25 birr). A successful data djinn test can trace the transfer back to Hassam’s payroll account. When the PCs examine the two bodies on the floor, they see that one of them is still alive – the kidnapping victim from Coriolis. She has terrible burns and can hardly breath, much less talk. All that remains for the PCs is to say a prayer and put her out of her misery.</li></ul><p>After this event, the PCs should begin to follow up on the leads from Act I. Asking around the markets about the fire is a good – but dangerous – start. Artyr’s manifest lists the address of the Hassam company, which also might be of interest. The search for the survivors hiding from Ataia should be pretty straightforward, with a few events thrown in here and there for dramatic effect.</p><p>Cost: 0–1 DP (Mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESONANCE – VOICES IN THE MIST</h5><p>PCs who have been affected by mystic resonance in the previous scenario or the opening scene in Act I may experience additional dreams if you wish to give them a hint that they are on the right track.</p><ul><li>At some point during their time in Little Algol – most likely during either a stressful situation or the complete opposite, such as sleep or intoxication – the mystic PC suddenly feels the now all too familiar anxiety and nausea setting in. Her vision blurs, sounds are distorted, and she loses her balance.</li><li>At the cost of 1 DP, have the PC test mystic powers to remain conscious. Failure means suffering a strength 2 @Item[Poison] attack (see page 113 of the Coriolis core rulebook) and D6 minutes of seizures and vomiting. At the cost of 2 DP, this happens during a conflict of some sort.</li><li>In her mind’s eye, the affected PC sees a foggy mirror image of the world, and out of the mist comes the distant echoes of a song. At first, it is just a ringing in the ears, but it gradually changes into an enormously powerful voice delivering a sad, woeful lament (see the adjacent box). Water can suddenly be heard dripping on stone, accompanied by harsh voices. The song is interrupted by pain shooting from the lumbar and the back of the head. A cold, tight grip closes around the neck, making it harder and harder to breath.</li></ul><p>This experience is an echo of the Emissary being brought out of stasis in the Sultra marshes. The song forebodes the arrival of the agents of the First Horizon and the imminent death of the Emissary itself. After a few minutes, the episode is over and the affected PC feels fine again.</p><p>Cost: 0–2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MEETING AT HASSAM</h5><p>Hassam Shipping is located at the center of the Souk Habra, near Panee Plaza. Hassam was brought into Artyr’s operations thanks to their discretion and careful cargo handling. Panee Plaza is crammed full of stalls and crowds of people. Outside the local Kaltash Amim brewery, spirits are high as local merchants and hands sit down around low tables to share some wine and a relaxing hookah. A sailcloth roof shelters the patrons from the blazing sun. Rows of brimming sacks of spices in the nearby Lamsha stall envelop the plaza in a mouth-watering potpourri of different smells, shifting focus from the unpleasant odor of the molding cushions outside the brewery. Wedged in-between the two larger establishments sits a small, anonymous-looking shack.</p><ul><li><strong>The Seer</strong>: As the PCs approach the shack, they spot an old soothsayer outside the door to the office (see the The Order’s Agent box). She seems uninterested in speaking to anyone and quickly disappears into the crowd.<br />A discreet metal door with a multi-colored mosaic depicting the sign of the Messenger and a small enamel sign showing Hassam’s pyramid logo are the only things hinting at the business going on behind the door. The door is unlocked and a narrow corridor behind it leads to the office, which is a cluttered mess of boxes upon boxes of exotic tea. Just inside the door however, Anou the eunuch lies motionless on a bloody Algolan rug.</li><li><strong>Niobe</strong>: Short and dressed in simpler clothing than others of her station – a simple, black kameez with floral patterns and a yellow shawl. A blue facial tattoo of two lines running from forehead to cheek acts as a reminder of the life she led before inheriting her uncle Marksu’s business.</li><li><strong>A Final Message</strong>: The PCs find the bloody Niobe on the floor in the inner room, face down with her arms underneath her. If they turn her body over, they find her clutching a communicator in her hands.</li><li><strong>Niobe’s Communicator</strong>: The com contains a message from Tubra sent this morning asking Niobe to leave the Souk Habra and meet her at the Hamam Tamina baths near Dignitary City. Niobe had replied, saying she couldn’t leave yet as she was still waiting for payment from dol-Quassar.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Investigative)</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><strong>THE ICON’S INSIGHT</strong><br /><em>The tunnels lead only forward.</em><br /><em>Like an arrow leaping from its string,</em><br /><em>I steady myself for the journey’s end.</em><br /><em>Living, still, in death. All that was shall be again.</em><br />– Nabi-mu-Qad, the Messenger Emissary</div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/hassams_emblem.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ASKING AROUND THE SOUK HABRA</h5><p>Chances are good that the PCs will start to ask around the Souk Habra for more information. They will find rumors in abundance here about both stasis pods and recent sales of coolant fluid, as well as about Tubra Ghutan and her work crews’ recent stroke of fatally bad luck. The narrow streets, tiny chai houses, oporias, and proxy dens are perfect places for private conversations over some kawah or chilled palm wine. Have the PCs test culture to find suitable informants and manipulation to convince them to share what they know.</p><ul><li><strong>The Stasis Pods</strong>: A lot of used stasis pods have been coming in from Baybasin and Verkâna Ridge lately. They probably come from the Hyderas sinkhole.</li><li><strong>The Stevedore Crew</strong>: Hassam and Tubra are relatively well-known names at the souk. Strangely enough, neither Tubra nor her stevedore crew of shady Algolans and Sogoi have been seen since about the day before yesterday. A visit to the slave market or Shamoud’s fight club might shed more light on the issue. If the PCs acheived a critical success on their manipulation roll, you could proceed to play the Tubra’s Partner event as a reward.</li><li><strong>Leod dol-Quassar</strong>: Even if the PCs have picked up information linking Tubra and Niobe Hassam to Leod dol-Quassar, a regular slummer will point them to Hassam’s office on Panee Plaza. They know nothing of the affairs of the smuggler prince.</li><li><strong>Rumors</strong>: A fairly well-established rumor claims that the slummer brigade is aided by weapons from master gunsmith and engineer Jarja Dougha. A confrontation seems fast approaching, in both the city and out in the plantations. The plantation owners are apparently having trouble keeping their workers in line. Some say that the living prophet Shauk – “the hand who said no” – is wandering the countryside in secret, teaching the plantation workers to read and write – and as the saying goes: “A learned hand is a dangerous hand”. Whether Shauk and the slummer brigade are working together is hard to know, but the mere possibility that they are is deeply troubling for the upper classes.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Investigative)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> 10 BIRR FOR A DREAM</h5><p>Little Algol is full of them – proxy dens. The PCs pass a discreet establishment where dreams (and nightmares) are sold. The den is crammed full, and some of the patrons look as if they have been there a long time – far too long.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE SLAVE MARKETS</h5><p>The PCs reach an open space in the middle of the Souk Habra aboard a moored, wide barge. Merchants in expensive clothing and stern-looking overseers haggle around a makeshift stage made from a couple of crates with a rug on top. Two guards bring up the “merchandise” from the cargo hold – malnourished, filthy shadows of human beings. A kabbara welcomes everyone to the auction and begins describing the items for sale. The PCs have arrived at one of the Conglomerate’s many slave auctions.</p><ul><li><strong>The Little Boy</strong>: A Miran boy stands in the middle of the stage. Tears stream down his dirty cheeks and he looks in horror across the crowd. His right arm looks wounded and is wrapped in dirty bandages. A successful culture or observation test allows a PC to recognize the boy as one of the many young people to have disappeared from Coriolis recently. He is a young student or the son of wealthy dignitary.</li><li><strong>Haggling</strong>: The PCs can try to buy the boy, which requires either a successful manipulation test at –1 (300 birr, or 50 birr on a critical success) or them offering 500 birr, an offer no one will try to outbid.</li><li><strong>Confrontation</strong>: They can also attempt to use force to free the boy and the four other slaves chained up in the cargo hold. Have the two slaver guards and D6 thuggish bodyguards working for visiting customers attack the PCs if they do. Use the slummer stats, except for one of the slaver guards who is an enormous brute – use Tubra Ghutan’s stats instead.</li></ul><p>If the boy, Nalad sin-Dalara, is rescued, he can recount waking up in a dark basement in a stasis pod and seeing a woman in a green shawl (Jarja Dougha). There were several other pods lining the walls and tools were scattered everywhere. He was thoroughly examined by the woman, who then muttered and bandaged his right arm saying:<br />“Your fate in Sky City would be much, much worse than if you go the markets – do not take off these bandages, okay?”</p><p>The boy was then brought up to a see a well-dressed man (Leod dol-Quassar) who sighed and waved him off as damaged goods. He was returned to the basement and brought to a rickety jetty where men in a boat waited for him.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (Investigative)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE NESTERA PATROL</h5><p>A Nestera patrol sweeps the area where the PCs are, behaving very cruelly toward the locals. The brutality with which innocent slummers are treated is shocking to the PCs. If they interfere, you can spend DP to escalate the situation, all the way to a firefight if you feel like it. At the cost of 1 DP, the patrol has three members, and at the cost of 2 DP, it has five.</p><p>Cost: 0–2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ONLY THE DEAD</h5><p>This event happens just as a funeral procession passes down the street: a Nestera squad attacks one of Yjala Bakou’s armed cells. An intense firefight breaks out. Hired mourners and grieving relatives of the deceased flee for their lives. Most make it, but some are cut down by bursts of Vulcan fire. Pools of blood form in the muddy street, shoes and torn clothing are strewn everywhere. The PCs find themselves in the middle of the battle and may have to choose sides, or shoot their way out.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ASSASSIN STRIKES</h5><p>Unless the PCs’ investigations are conducted discreetly, Ataia will become interested in them and their affairs. As they are searching for clues about the fate of Tubra, the assassin will try to kill them. Ataia knows that her key targets are Tubra Ghutan and Leod dol-Quassar and won’t risk exposure by facing the PCs in person. She plants an explosive device either in their lodgings or in a place they visit often. It is a motion-triggered bomb placed under a bed or a table.</p><ul><li><strong>The Explosion</strong>: Have the PC closest to the bomb test observation to sense that something isn’t right. If the roll fails, she spots nothing out of the ordinary and the bomb goes off when a PC comes too close or makes a sudden move (triple satchel charge, blast effect 4, weapon damage 1, CRIT 2, Close range).</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WITNESS</h5><p>In the crowded souk, the PCs suddenly spot one of the scavengers who raided the warehouse ruins on Pier 58. She sits outside one of the Souk Habra’s many chai houses, examining her haul from the pier while sipping on a hot cup of tea. In front of her are also two containers of coolant liquid identical to the ruptured one found at the scene by the PCs, but the scavenger is very reluctant to tell them where she got them. She claims to have found them in the debris on the pier, but they are much too clean to have been through the fire.</p><ul><li><strong>Silver Tongues</strong>: A friendly approach and a difficult (–2) manipulation test is required to convince her to tell the PCs the truth. If they succeed, she admits to getting them from two of Hassam’s workers in exchange for letting them hide at her cousin Shamoud’s fight club. Shamoud is a pit dog trainer working out of a basement storage in a condemned building in Dignitary City. Where the workers got the canisters from, she doesn’t know, but they are worth 300 birr each on the black markets in the Marzu Khala spaceport.</li></ul><p>A donation of a couple of birr buys the PCs the address to Shamoud’s fight club (see below) and a dirty Gambler talisman which they will need to show at the door to be let in.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (Investigative)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SHAMOUD’S FIGHT CLUB</h5><p>Shamoud’s gambling den and arena is located underneath a collapsed customs office on the border between the flooded Mibea and Dignitary City. The house is in bad shape and surrounded by walls of sandbags and sheets of metal to keep the rising waters of Lake Ytamara at bay. The entrance is hidden under a semi-collapsed colonnade surrounded by shacks and huts. A Sadaalian bouncer is hidden in the shadows by the door with scars and face tattoos identifying her as a former Legionnaire (use the soldier stats).</p><ul><li><strong>Getting In</strong>: Getting in requires either a successful manipulation test at –1, the Faction standing: The Syndicate talent or having helped the Birbasils in Baybasin. If the PCs acquired the Gambler talisman in the The Witness event above, they are let in straight away.</li></ul><p>The club is a large two-story basement with stairs along the walls leading up to balconies overlooking the steel cages in the middle where the fights take place. The old desks once used by the customs officers have been cannibalized to construct a sturdy bar and few rows of low benches where visitors can sit down to drink, smoke, and watch the matches.</p><ul><li><strong>Asking Around</strong>: If the PCs start asking around about where they might find the stevedores working for Hassam, a heated argument in Algolan breaks out around them. Tensions run high and people ready themselves to fight. Calming the situation requires a successful manipulation test at –2. If any of the PCs speak Algolan, the test is without modifiers.</li><li><strong>High-Strung Patrons</strong>: If the PCs fail the test, you may spend 1 DP to escalate the argument to a fistfight (use the slummer stats) or 2 DP to sic four pit dogs (page 102 @Actor[Ramses' Warhounds]) on the PCs. If a fight breaks out, Shamoud will shout at the group: “You follow in Death’s footsteps! No good will come from Hassam’s dealings with that false Zenithian. Leave now – or we’ll make you leave.”</li><li><strong>De-Escalation</strong>: If the PCs manage to calm the situation down, Shamoud and his staff will reveal that the two workers who hid in the club were found dead in one of the dog cages a few hours ago. Noticeably nervous patrons can also share that they have heard about other members of Hassam’s work crew turning up murdered around Little Algol. The workers’ foreman, Tubra Ghutan, has gone into hiding, and people who know her are scared. Tubra is a respected name in the hands’ community in the Khabal district and someone who many turn to for guidance. Why her workers are ending up dead is not known, but many suspect that Niobe Hassam has somehow soured her relationship with Little Algol’s slummer prince, Leod dol-Quassar.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0–2 DP (Investigative)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  TUBRA’S PARTNER</h5><p>If the PCs at some point during their investigation make it obvious that they are trying to help the remaining stevedores working for Hassam, they will eventually be approached by a young half-Zenithian:</p><ul><li>She introduces herself as Wala and asks to speak to them in private. Wala explains that she and Tubra are life partners in secret and that they often meet in one of the private rooms in the back of the Hamam Tamina baths in Dignitary City.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Investigative)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LAST PALLBEARER</h5><p>Eventually, the PCs will figure out that Tubra is likely to be hiding at the Hamam Tamina and go there to speak to her. No one is allowed to enter the baths armed, and all gear will be taken care of by the staff in the foyer. The PCs are then given towels and washbowls and shown to the Water temple, where their clothes are also taken away. The establishment is very discreet and professional, and Tamina can proudly say that she never accepts bribes or shares any information about her clients. After sweating through the mandatory sauna stop, the PCs enter the main baths, where they must be careful as they go about their investigation. They can either subtly converse with the regulars and test manipulation at –1 to find out which room to go to, or test observation if they have previously encountered or helped someone who might have described Tubra to them.</p><ul><li><strong>Tubra’s partner</strong>: If the PCs met with Wala and were friendly to her, she will tell them which room she and Tubra usually meet in.</li></ul><p>When they find Tubra, the situation becomes very tense. She thinks that the PCs are here to kill her and gets ready to fight. A successful manipulation or command test is required to calm Tubra down, after which she becomes her normal, obedient self and shares the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The Pods</strong>: Her work crew have been shipping stasis pods with people inside from Artyr’s rented warehouses on Pier 58 to the basement in Leod dol-Quassar’s palace.</li><li><strong>The Nobleman</strong>: Leod is a Dabaran noble running much of Little Algol’s slave trade for the Syndicate. He dreams of leaving his run-down palace and moving to Covenant City.</li><li><strong>The Arrangement</strong>: Leod and Artyr have struck a deal which allows Leod to keep some of the pods for himself. All pods are inspected by Leod’s engineer, Jarja Dougha – a well-known gunsmith in the area – before Hassam gets paid, sometimes in birr and sometimes in bars of some kind of strange metal.</li><li><strong>The Final Destination</strong>: Tubra has heard rumors that some of the people in the pods have been sold as slaves to the Monolith, but that others have been transported to an unknown location in the Sultra marshes by Leod’s own workers.</li><li><strong>The Assassin</strong>: A few days ago, two of Tubra’s workers failed to show up for their shift, but she thought nothing of it at the time. Just as the rest of the crew had finished up shipping Artyr’s latest delivery to dol-Quassar’s palace, the warehouses burst into flames and some of her workers were trapped inside. Tubra started suspecting foul play and began hiding her workers, but was constantly one step behind the killer. She eventually contacted Niobe Hassam, her employer, and warned her about the threat.</li><li><strong>The Closed Palace</strong>: When arriving at the palace with the last delivery (if the final delivery of kidnepped victims got this far), the guards initially refused to let Tubra’s workers in. The smuggler prince has a huge banquet planned to celebrate his son’s betrothal to a wealthy Zenithian, but the rumors of a killer on the loose in Little Algol have him worked up and paranoid.</li><li><strong>Aid</strong>: If the PCs can help Tubra escape Little Algol, preferably together with Wala, she will do anything they ask in return.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"JgnhRFFc33esWjoi","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296356,"modifiedTime":1682695296356,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"CzUEdkaKoI0pi4si","sort":0,"_id":"hd71kCJ4TlaO2Jwz"}

Having access to a skilled workforce in spaceports and souks, they offer a service the Consortium cannot.</h3><p><strong>The League</strong>, as it is commonly called, was originally created as a counterweight to the Consortium, but had no way of competing in the beginning. They tried to perform the same functions as the Consortium, but have over time changed their attitude towards nurturing a more symbiotic relationship instead. The fact of the matter is that without the League’s deckhands, pilots and engineers, all of the Consortium’s ships and haulers would wait in dock, their cargo unloaded, and without the free traders, Consortium commerce wouldn’t reach as far out on the star arms as it does. In the shadows, both parties are still trying to out-maneuver the other, however.</p><p>When it comes to free traders and markets outside of the core systems, the League is practically in a monopoly position. The risks compared to the calculated profit are too great for any of the major Consortium companies to get involved. The League runs several auction houses and souks in the outer systems, as well as a few on both Kua and Coriolis.</p><p>The current goal for the League is to keep its control of the outer markets, and to improve the living conditions of its members. No other faction is as open about its membership as the League – counting official members, the Free League is the Horizon’s largest faction.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>MEMBERSHIP</h5><p>The faction is based on paid membership. Every member must pay a license fee of 100 birr per CC, and in return, she is protected by the League through legal counsel, insurance and, perhaps most importantly, the right to bid on auctions. Through better working conditions, higher salaries and better insurance policies, the League makes life better for its members every day. They also run a school in Coriolis, free for members since they still have to work while they study. A new academy for captains and astrogators has just been opened on Coriolis, something the Foundation has protested loudly as they claim the sole rights to all portal stations and the crewing of them.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/Fria_ligan_fraktion.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LEAGUE’S DIRTY LAUNDRY</h5><p>The League’s biggest problem is the alleged connection between itself and the Syndicate – something widely proclaimed by the Consortium. The League’s council member, Jesibel Niales, has time and again repudiated the accusations in very vivid language. To quiet the rumors, the League has begun hiring bounty hunters to go after corsairs, smugglers and even the Algolan slavers.</p><p>Another fly in the ointment is that the League’s own so-called Night Hands, the paramilitary wing of the organization previously reserved for dealing with scabs and disloyal members, seems to have become more autonomous. The leader of the Night Hands, the stevedore Zahria, is often seen around the dodgy parts of the Ozone Plaza and is rumored to have dealings with the Syndicate.</p><p>It is not all bad for the League of course – living astrogator legend Ehina Kuma still joins a new crew before every trip, bringing the Icons’ benevolent grace with her. Other celebrity members include Baris Khan, head pilot on the Net, and shipless captain Fatma Boroudi who takes jobs wherever a captain is needed. Some regard it as a bad omen when she comes walking through a port looking to ship out.<br />The League is actively recruiting among the plebeians in the Conglomerate, something the local elite, the factory owners and the Consortium are less than happy with.</p><p>Some even say that the League supports some of the uprisings in the Conglomerate. The Slum Queen Yjala Baktou has previously been a League member, but now fights against the Zenithians in the Ara-Ara borough close to the Monolith.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE LEAGUE BOROUGHS</h5><p>In the last few cycles, The League has begun organizing itself in different neighborhoods in the larger cities of the Horizon. In metropolitan areas, such as Akhandar, Cimoran and Daharab, new boroughs with their own militias, hospitals, schools and even sanitation, water and energy plants have formed. The League seems to be on a quest for urban colonization across the Third Horizon, something that the other factions will likely not accept in the long run.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"gPS1ysOhttxeu0Jy","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266504,"modifiedTime":1680376266504,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"heThYJ17oqtnvvBq"}

La sécurité intérieure ne leur est cependant pas confiée, car elle relève de la compétence du service de renseignement, les ultrasecrets Renseignements Généraux.</p><h1>LE BULLETIN</h1><p>Le Bulletin, un conglomérat de médias basé sur Coriolis, est l’agence de presse la plus importante de l’Horizon. Leur devise, « Digne d’intérêt médiatique et accessible », donne le ton de leur couverture de l’actualité et des autres émissions qu’ils diffusent.</p><p>Comme leur siège se trouve sur Coriolis, les nouvelles et les autres programmes proviennent principalement de la station elle-même, ou des stations portails,où ils maintiennent un certain degré de présence. Ils envoient bien évidemment des correspondants aux confins de l’Horizon s’il y survient un événement suffisamment sensationnel, ainsi que sur les sites et les planètes les plus visités par les pèlerins.</p><p>Ils engagent généralement des indépendants pour les missions les plus éloignées, ce qui réduit au minimum les coûts et les risques.</p><p>Outre les nouvelles et les divertissements, le Bulletin propose également un service de coursier et de messagerie appelé la Messagerie Ermès. Les navires Ermès transportent principalement les nouvelles du Bulletin, mais également d’autres messages et informations, et, en de plus rares occasions, du courrier postal.</p><h1>LA FONDATION</h1><p>La Fondation est la partie laïque du Consortium qui s’occupe principalement de la recherche et du développement. Ils sont connus pour leur vision extrêmement rationnelle et scientifique, en un mot zénithienne, du monde. Comme son nom l’indique, l’entreprise fonctionne comme une fondation, elle vend et loue ses découvertes à des tierces parties.</p><p>Outre les recherches sur les champs de portails et l’astronomie, dans des instituts répartis à travers tout l’Horizon, les principaux domaines de recherche de la Fondation sont la socio-arithmétique, la recherche sur l’intelligence, l’archéologie portale et la bionique.</p><h1>L’AGENCE COLONIALE</h1><p>À l’époque où l’Horizon était encore nouveau et méconnu des Zénithiens, la famille Yriedes créa une agence chargée de financer, d'organiser et d'établir de nouvelles colonies. De nos jours, il est rare qu’elle trouve elle-même de nouvelles colonies et l’Agence coloniale, à travers son extension, la Banque Coloniale, se concentre désormais sur le financement, l’éducation et la location d’équipement technologique à des entrepreneurs indépendants désireux de démarrer des opérations minières, des colonies et des usines.</p><p>Elle gère également une école sur Coriolis, le Centre d’Enseignement Supérieur de l’Agence Coloniale, dans laquelle sont formés les meilleurs éclaireurs, explorateurs et colons de l’Horizon.</p><p>Grâce à des investissements dans l’industrie lourde du Consortium, l’Agence a accès à des chalutiers à poussière, des drones miniers, des fonderies mobiles et d’autres machines lourdes qu’un entrepreneur pourrait avoir besoin de louer. Des navettes Hypérion et des transporteurs lourds s’occupent de la partie transport.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"La légion","type":"text","_id":"vkOzG2GPxmUzMIBJ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/legion.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /><p>« Les meilleurs doivent périr pour que le reste puisse vivre. »</p><p></p><p>La Légion se compose d’un ensemble hétéroclite de mercenaires et de patrouilleurs armés, rassemblés autour des vestiges d’un escadron de la flotte datant de la Guerre des Portails.</p><p>La Légion est la plus récente des factions Premières, à tel point qu’elle est généralement considérée comme faisant partie des Zénithiens, bien que cela soit principalement dû aux liens étroits qu’elle entretient avec le Consortium.</p><p>La Légion fut fondée par les deux vaisseaux amiraux, le <strong>Shahrazad</strong> et le <strong>Dunyazad</strong> et leur escorte, seuls survivants de la Seconde Flotte Shadussar à l’issue des Guerres des Portails.</p><p>Les survivants, devenus chefs de guerre et pirates, parcoururent tout l’Horizon au cours des années chaotiques qui suivirent la fin du conflit. La plupart des atrocités perpétrées à cette époque peuvent d’ailleurs être imputées à la Légion... ce qu’à présent elle refuse catégoriquement de reconnaître.</p><p>Puis le Zénith arriva, et le Consortium fut fondé. Cela signifiait un nouvel employeur potentiel très puissant, et par conséquent de nombreuses nouvelles possibilités. La Légion actuelle était née.</p><h1>ORGANISATION DE LA LÉGION</h1><p>La Légion d’aujourd’hui s’organise toujours autour de ses deux vaisseaux amiraux, mais s’articule par ailleurs en trois branches distinctes : la flotte, les compagnies et la Garde.</p><h2>La flotte</h2><p>Pour beaucoup, la flotte représente la véritable Légion. Même si l’un des vaisseaux amiraux a disparu (à moins qu'il ne soit parti en mission secrète), l’armada continue de se développer.</p><p>Personne ne connaît sa taille exacte. Selon les rumeurs, la Légion a toujours accès à des bases secrètes datant des années chaotiques d’après-guerre dans tout l’Horizon, mais personne ne le sait avec certitude. Le Consortium est la seule faction qui utilise la flotte de nos jours.</p><h2>Les compagnies</h2><p>Les compagnies sont l'aspect le plus commun de la Légion. Bien des factions emploient cette branche pour toutes sortes de missions. Les compagnies ne sont pas tant une armée uniforme qu’un agglomérat de groupes de mercenaires qui, grâce à leur affiliation à la Légion, ont l’opportunité de décrocher des missions lucratives.</p><p>La faction a mis en place des règles très strictes qui détaillent la manière dont une mission doit être exécutée, et toutes les compagnies membres doivent s’y conformer. Si elles désobéissent à ces instructions d’une manière ou d’une autre, elles risquent l’expulsion, et leurs meneurs seront pourchassés puis exécutés.</p><h2>La garde</h2><p>Des trois branches de la Légion, la Garde de Coriolis a la plus mauvaise réputation. Elle répond directement au gouverneur de la station et a pour mission d’y maintenir la paix et l’ordre.</p><p>Les autres Légionnaires les considèrent comme de faux mercenaires ou comme des Légionnaires fantoches.

Mais, à ses débuts, elle n’avait aucun moyen de rivaliser avec lui. Elle a bien essayé pendant un temps d’exercer les mêmes fonctions, mais a fini par changer de tactique, et tend plutôt, à présent, à entretenir des relations plus symbiotiques.</p><p>Le fait est que sans les matelots, les pilotes et les ingénieurs de la Ligue, tous les navires et les transporteurs du Consortium resteraient bloqués à quai, à attendre que leur cargaison soit déchargée.</p><p>La Ligue gère de nombreux hôtels des ventes et autant de souks dans les systèmes extérieurs, ainsi que quelques-uns sur Kua et Coriolis.</p><h1>LE LINGE SALE DE LA LIGUE</h1><p>Le plus gros problème auquel la Ligue doit faire face est sa prétendue connexion avec le Syndicat, du moins si l’on en croit les allégations du Consortium. La représentante de la Ligue au conseil, Jésibel Nialès, a récusé ces accusations à maintes reprises et dans un langage très coloré.

De plus, elles investissent massivement dans des projets zénithiens, qu’ils soient de nature industrielle ou scientifique.</p><p>Les deux groupes contrôlent chacun quelques institutions-clés au sein de la faction. Les Hégémonistes dirigent la tristement célèbre police secrète, l’Astûrban, tandis que les Néo-Zénithiens sont à l’origine des Judicateurs et dominent la puissante flotte de la faction.

La classe dirigeante n’a qu’une obsession : préserver l’unité génétique des survivants du Zénith.

C’est la plus jeune faction de l’Horizon, et elle s’est développée en collectant, canonisant et institutionnalisant la foi vaste et tentaculaire qui existe dans l’Horizon depuis des siècles.</p><p>Les neuf rites sacrés furent consignés par écrit à Iconopolis sur Mira  au cours d’une émission du Bulletin diffusée en direct en CC 49.</p><p>À la tête de cette nouvelle faction, on trouve une matriarche et un patriarche, eux-mêmes assistés par une assemblée de ministres du culte.  De nos jours, les Questeurs, qui maintenaient également une forte présence sur Mira, se retrouvent marginalisés, considérés comme des ascètes et des prophètes d’une grande sagesse, plutôt que comme de véritables figures de pouvoir au sein de l’organisation.</p><p>La principale différence entre la doctrine de l’Église et le folklore iconique réside dans le fait que la faction nie la dualité des tempéraments et le caractère vindicatif des Icônes. Au lieu de cela, l’Église prêche que le mal existe en chacun, et qu’il est libéré lorsque l’Ombre entre les Étoiles entre dans la vie de quelqu’un.</p><h1>LE CERCLE DES QUESTEURS</h1><p>Quiconque veut obtenir le titre de Questeur doit d’abord suivre une initiation dans l’un des monastères de l’organisation, toujours construits en forme de cercle. Selon les rumeurs, les Questeurs possède des pouvoirs mystiques et en ont le contrôle absolu.</p><p>Les Questeurs ont la réputation d’être d’habiles négociateurs. Ils ont souvent été appelés pour mettre fin à d’âpres conflits. En dehors de cela, le Cercle a plutôt tendance à faire profil bas.

Des expéditions partent régulièrement des systèmes centraux en direction des étoiles, et à leur bord on retrouve souvent des missionnaires et des Questeurs. </p><p>Contrairement à ce que l’on pourrait penser, le membre le plus célèbre de l’Église n’est ni la matriarche ni le patriarche, mais le membre du conseil <strong>Wasimah Umm</strong>, ancien Questeur devenue Arch Herat.

Il gère un hôpital, un sanatorium pour les personnes gravement malades, une maison pour les pauvres, plusieurs soupes populaires et une école de médecine renommée. </p><p>Les étudiants en médecine deviennent des néophytes de l’Ordre et leur éducation est fortement influencée par ses opinions religieuses, mais ils reçoivent tous des bourses généreuses pour la durée de leur formation. Toutefois, lorsqu’ils obtiennent leur diplôme, ils se voient souvent offrir un emploi par des groupes qui ne sont pas très amicaux envers l’Ordre, ce qui est en soi une bonne indication de la qualité de l’école. </p><p>Les Samaritains sont en apparence de parfaits croyants, qui viennent en aide à leurs semblables par pure bonté d’âme. C’est grâce à leur travail sur Coriolis que l’Ordre conserve sa réputation, car la population principalement zénithienne de la station n’a pas vraiment à cœur de se souvenir de son implication dans les atrocités de la Guerre des Portails.</p><p>L’Ordre des Parias est d’ascendance Première, et vénère le Martyr (l’Icône plus communément appelée Juge).

Pour le Temple, les Icônes représentent les différentes attitudes de l’âme humaine, à la fois spirituelles et physiques.</p><p>Les enseignements d’Ahlam peuvent s’appliquer à tout, de la danse et l’art à la théorie judiciaire et la politique. Les méthodes d’interrogatoire des Judicateurs, qui n’utilisent pas la torture, sont basées sur une théorie Ahlamite.</p><h1>LES COURTISANS</h1><p>Le Temple est surtout célèbre pour les académies de courtisans qu'il dirige sur Coriolis et Mira. L'éducation y est entièrement axée sur les huit arts du plaisir. </p><p>Outre les courtisans, de nombreux rhétoriciens, prophètes, animateurs et officiers influents ont fréquenté ces académies. L’Hégémonie zénithienne et le Bulletin y envoient régulièrement des employés et des aristocrates pour y apprendre les mystères de la subjectivité et de la contribution sensorielle.</p><p>Que ce soit sur Coriolis ou dans d’autres métropoles, la demande est forte pour les véritables courtisans. Dans certains endroits, il serait impensable d’entrer dans l’arène politique sans un courtisan à ses côtés. </p><p>Il existe également une section du Temple dont on parle moins, ce sont les Lotus noirs, des courtisans entraînées au neuvième art : le plaisir de la mort. Ces assassins ont joué un rôle crucial par le passé, mais il est impossible, pour des personnes extérieures à la faction, de savoir s’ils sont encore en activité à l'heure actuelle. </p><p>Le Temple dispose d’une technologie ancienne, la technologie proxy. Elle a été conçue à des fins thérapeutiques et éducatives et vous permet de partager les expériences et les connaissances d’une autre personne.  Malheureusement, le Syndicat a volé cette technologie et l’utilise pour fabriquer ce qu’il appelle des trips proxy. Le Temple se bat pour récupérer sa technologie, mais jusqu’ici n’y est pas parvenu.</p><h1>LA MÉMATHURGIE D’AHLAM</h1><p>Indépendamment de la technologie proxy, des rumeurs laissent entendre que les philosophes du Temple sont capables de créer leurs propres mèmes. En manipulant des signaux lumineux, sonores et biologiques, ceux que l’on surnomme mémathurges peuvent faire croire ou faire faire aux gens des choses non conformes à leur nature.

Quand ils rejoignirent de nouveau la lumière de la civilisation, ils se présentèrent comme une faction disciplinée de philosophes guerriers, porteurs de vérités secrètes dont les autres factions ne pouvaient que rêver.</p><h1>LES SECRETS DES DRACONITES</h1><p>Les Draconites utilisent une technologie avancée basée sur des éléments clairement hérités de la sagesse perdue des anciens Horizons.</p><p>La manière dont l’Ordre s’organise reste secrète, cependant il semble opérer sur le modèle de cellules centrées sur des dirigeants forts, chacune évitant les contacts avec les autres. Une autre possibilité serait que quelqu’un (ou quelque chose) tire les ficelles dans l’ombre et guide la faction vers un objectif inconnu.</p><p>La seule chose que l’on sait avec certitude est qu’ils fonctionnent avec un système d’apprentis : un membre plus âgé guide et initie un jeune novice aux mystères de l’Ordre. Certains pensent que l’Ordre se compose d’une série de cercles et que ses membres cherchent tous à accéder au cercle suivant et ainsi de suite, afin de progresser vers le sanctuaire intérieur au centre.</p><p>La philosophie de l’Ordre est l’objet de nombre de débats et de théories toutes plus extravagantes les unes que les autres. Il est clair pour tout un chacun qu’ils mettent l’accent sur le conflit en tant que concept métaphysique. Ils le considèrent comme une forme de développement personnel et collectif.</p><p>Même si la plupart des gens pensent que c’est une approche très violente du monde, certains avancent que cette philosophie englobe également les conflits intérieurs, ces luttes perpétuelles contre les parties impures du soi, et que les Draconites cherchent à affronter et à vaincre leurs démons intérieurs, quoi qu’il leur en coûte.</p><p>Cela se reflète à bien des égards dans le culte que l’Ordre voue à la Dame des Larmes sous son incarnation la plus froide et stricte, le Bourreau.</p><h1>NI MAISON NI FOYER</h1><p>Personne ne connaît l’emplacement du quartier général des Draconites. L’Ordre maintient sa présence un peu partout dans l’Horizon, mais elle se réduit généralement à un unique membre, parfois une poignée tout au plus.

Dans l’assemblée populaire sur Coriolis, les itinérants soutenaient depuis un moment qu’il était grand temps que les Zénithiens se mettent à respecter les lois et les décrets d’antan.</p><p>Jusqu’à récemment, les factions zénithiennes n’avaient jamais prêté une oreille attentive à ces exigences, et elles commencent à le regretter amèrement. Leurs menaces incluent l’interruption du commerce du Consortium dans le Quadrant du Pilier et des activités de la Ligue Franche dans le système Nharmada, et une grève collective contre les prospecteurs dans la Bordure extérieure. Comme les nomades sont capables de rassembler une armada impressionnante au besoin, ces menaces ne sont pas prises à la légère.</p><h1>UNE FÉDÉRATION PRÉOCCUPÉE</h1><p>L’immense Fédération fait face à un énorme problème interne. Non seulement il lui est très difficile de pouvoir présenter un front uni (il reste encore trop de vieilles rancœurs transmises de génération en génération entre certaines tribus rivales pour cela), mais en plus elle soutient des us et coutumes antiques qui diviseraient l’organisation elle-même en plusieurs classes sociales, chacune avec des intérêts contradictoires.</p><p>Les nomades du Quadrant du Pilier, représentés par <strong>Osman Naqsh-i-Jahan</strong>, se montrent finalement assez peu préoccupés par toute politique qui n’affecte pas directement la route de Mira. Ils sont toutefois parfaitement disposés à fermer les portails entre Kua et Altaï au Consortium si leur souveraineté n’est pas reconnue.</p><p>Les nuées de la Bordure extérieure, représentées par <strong>Urcia Kabu</strong>, ont une expérience de première main de la manière dont les Zénithiens du Consortium peuvent perturber des systèmes entiers avec leurs plans sournois.</p><p>L’envoyé de la lignée Housyan, <strong>Qur Farabi l’Aveugle</strong>, sollicite l’aide de la Ligue Franche pour établir des accords commerciaux avec le Consortium. De plus, ils préconisent que les nomades abordent les autres cultures de l’Horizon par l’éducation et la compassion.</p><p>Pour un extérieur, il peut être très difficile de discerner le groupe qui se fait le plus entendre. Une certaine confusion linguistique perturbe également les nomades au sein de la faction.</p><h1>SOUTIEN AU CONSEIL</h1><p>Le Temple d’Ahlam et les Draconites soutiennent ses revendications. Ces deux factions ont d’excellents rapports commerciaux avec les errants depuis bien longtemps. Cependant, toutes les factions Premières ne partagent pas le même avis. Officiellement, l’Ordre des Parias et la Fédération ont coupé toutes les communications après l’attaque que le clan nomade Tanziamat a subie sur Zalos-B.</p><p>Les factions zénithiennes ne sont pas satisfaites des nouvelles exigences de la Fédération. Le Consortium et, dans une certaine mesure, la Ligue Franche, deux organisations centrées autour du commerce, se méfient de ces concurrents potentiels, et la Légion est anxieuse face à la force navale de la Fédération. L’Hégémonie zénithienne n’a pas encore émis d’opinion sur ces itinérants. La politique est un jeu de shah, après tout.</p><h1>UNE FLOTTE REDOUTABLE</h1><p>La Fédération nomade contrôle ce qui constitue de loin la plus large flotte de l’Horizon, bien qu’une grande partie soit composée de vaisseaux civils et qu’elle soit répartie sur de nombreux systèmes. Des rapports récents suggèrent toutefois que les itinérants ont commencé à former de plus grands convois armés.</p><p>Suhaima Taslim s’est exprimée fermement à ce sujet lors d’une émission du Bulletin, disant que si la militarisation de la flotte nomade se poursuit, la Légion devra réagir. Goharshûd a rétorqué que le nombre de pirates à l'affut le long des routes nomades est plus important que jamais, parce que les transporteurs lourds du Consortium ont commencé à atteindre les systèmes les plus pauvres où ils chassent les commerçants locaux, ce qui force les gens ordinaires à se tourner vers la piraterie.</p><p>Dès lors, le moins que l’on puisse dire est que les relations entre la Fédération et la Légion sont glaciales.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1100000,"name":"Les acteurs secondaires","type":"text","_id":"OX63LMjVjup9rNvi","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Les acteurs secondaires sont des groupes et des organisations qui opèrent un niveau en-dessous des factions. Les factions sont peut-être les véritables dirigeants de l'Horizon, mais elles ne peuvent pas tout gérer par elles-mêmes et certains domaines d’activité sont, du moins officiellement, abandonnés à des organisations à la réputation plus discutable. </p><h1>HALLES DE FRANCS-MARCHANDS</h1><p>Il existe partout dans l’Horizon des marchés où les francs-marchands et les revendeurs se rencontrent pour faire des affaires. Généralement, les halles de francs-marchands se ressemblent toutes. Les négociants et les francs-marchands se retrouvent sur une place ou dans un autre espace ouvert, regroupés autour des khabaras, des courtiers sous contrats souvent bruyants et charismatiques. </p><p>Le khabara met ensuite aux enchères les différentes missions commerciales. Le tonnage, les prix, les destinations et les délais de livraison sont discutés à haute voix, et les capitaines offrent leurs vaisseaux aux négociants. Le khabara reçoit une petite commission de courtage pour chaque transaction conclue. </p><p>Le tarif des missions est fixé publiquement sur le marché afin qu’aucune des parties ne puisse changer l’accord par la suite sans ruiner sa réputation.</p><h1>MARCHÉS DE « LA DERNIÈRE CHANCE »</h1><p>Plus loin sur les bras stellaires, dans les systèmes extérieurs ou autour des lointaines étoiles sœurs où les routes commerciales aboutissent, vous trouverez les marchés dits de « la dernière chance ». Personne ne met les pieds là-bas sans porter un Vulcain ou se faire accompagner d’un garde du corps.</p><p>Les missions commerciales vers et à partir des frontières de la civilisation peuvent rapporter d’énormes profits, mais malheureusement, les francs-marchands désespérés ne sont pas les seuls à fréquenter ces endroits : les pirates, seigneurs de guerre, tyrans locaux et autres personnages peu recommandables affluent vers ces marchés pour s’approvisionner en nouvelles technologies originaires des systèmes centraux, ce qui conduit parfois à l’enlèvement de capitaines ou d’équipages entiers.</p><h1>AGENCES D’INDÉPENDANTS</h1><p>Pour les groupes d’indépendants ou d’agents, les missions ne sont pas aussi faciles à trouver que pour les francs-marchands ou les mercenaires. Les emplois bien rémunérés sont très probablement assurés par les agences de renseignement, et elles acceptent rarement une aide extérieure.</p><p>Le travail d’enquête quel qu’il soit, des personnes disparues à l’espionnage industriel, se gère généralement en privé et en toute discrétion, et il est très facile de trouver de nombreuses agences de détectives grâce à l’Infonet. Certaines grandes agences indépendantes sur Coriolis embauchent parfois des experts pour différentes tâches.</p><h1>NIDS D’ESPIONS</h1><p>Certains endroits du Troisième Horizon sont plus empreints de mensonges et d’intrigues que d’autres. C’est dans ce genre de lieux que les services de renseignement convergent lorsqu’ils sont à la recherche d’informations et de secrets. </p><p>Le monde des secrets est bien entendu toujours en mouvement, mais compte tenu des luttes intestines au sein du Conseil des factions et des tensions politiques croissantes dans tout l’Horizon, certains endroits, comme la Cité des Étrangers sur la lune de Karrmerruk, dans les système Zalos par exemple, sont des valeurs sûres.</p><p>Des espions, des mercenaires à la botte de corporations, des correspondants et des indépendants affluent vers la ville dans l’espoir d’y dénicher des secrets, des marchandises précieuses ou des contrats de valeur.</p><h1>LES AGENCES DE RENSEIGNEMENT</h1><p>Les grandes factions disposent de leurs propres agences de renseignement, internes et externes, et la plupart des corporations ont des départements de contre-espionnage. La plupart des factions et des régimes emploient également des polices secrètes, comme Sadaal et Zalos par exemple, et l’Hégémonie zénithienne dispose du redoutable Astûrban. Ils ne sont pas enclins à embaucher des indépendants, mais cela peut arriver, du moins de manière totalement officieuse.</p><p>Les grandes entreprises, telles que l’Agence coloniale, le Bulletin, Nestera, Nyala et Céler-Délekta par exemple, embauchent des indépendants pour toutes sortes de missions d’enquête.</p><h1>MISSIONS DE MESSAGERS</h1><p>Envoyer des messages et des informations à travers l’Horizon requiert un vaisseau, car aucun signal ne peut passer à travers les portails.  Les personnes aux fortes exigences en matière de discrétion choisissent souvent des entreprises de moindre envergure, ce qui crée de fait un marché conséquent pour les équipages de messagers indépendants. Ces missions sont courantes dans les souks des francs-marchands, et un équipage peut réaliser un bon profit en effectuant une mission de messagerie en parallèle de cargaisons régulières.</p><h1>AGENCES DE MERCENAIRES</h1><p>Le marché des mercenaires fonctionne de la même manière que le marché des messagers. Bien que la Légion y conserve un quasi-monopole, il reste cependant des missions dont elle ne peut s’acquitter.  Sur les plaques tournantes telles que Coriolis, Akhandar-O-Sharif et Tirgonum, on retrouve de grandes agences de mercenaires gérées par des acteurs privés mais dont les contrats sont fournis par la Légion.</p><p>Dans des bureaux de ce genre, les groupes de mercenaires peuvent s’inscrire et répertorier leurs vaisseaux, leurs ressources et leurs domaines d’expertise, que ce soit le tir de précision, les explosifs, le DATA DJINN, l’infiltration ou autre. Le client potentiel peut donc choisir anonymement la compagnie qui conviendra le mieux pour la mission. Des réunions sont ensuite organisées par l’agence pour régler les questions contractuelles et les négociations.</p><h1>VOYAGEURS ET CARAVANES SPATIALES</h1><p>Depuis que les Zénithiens ont ouvert l’Horizon, et surtout depuis que l’Église des Icônes a déclaré que le pèlerinage était un rite sacré, les voyages se sont multipliés de manière exponentielle.</p><p>Les riches se déplacent à bord des luxueux vaisseaux de ligne Exeter ou sur leurs propres yachts privés. Les pauvres peuvent parcourir l’Horizon en trouvant un emploi sur les vaisseaux, ou embarquer à bord des cargos de stase bon marché que certaines des plus grandes compagnies de transport affrètent. Il existe un autre moyen, qui est de se faire prendre en stop par des nomades, des expéditions ou des caravanes. </p><p>Plusieurs groupes de divertissement ont commencé à parcourir l’Horizon au cours des derniers cycles. Ce sont des vaisseaux de courtisans, des cirques, des troupes de théâtre ou des artistes et ils se partagent les routes entre les systèmes centraux, atterrissant dans les ports, les marchés et les bazars, en particulier pendant les festivals.</p><h1>INSTITUTS DE RECHERCHE</h1><p>Les scientifiques et les explorateurs rejoignent souvent une académie ou un corps enseignant plus vaste afin d’obtenir des financements pour leur travail. Les portails et la xénoarchéologie sont des domaines très à la mode.</p><p>Les instituts plus modestes en sont réduits à demander des fonds à de riches mécènes ou à des seigneurs locaux. Ces expéditions embauchent généralement des capitaines indépendants et leur petit navire, plus quelques mercenaires si le travail comporte des risques. </p><p>Dans l’Hégémonie et les tribunaux de Dabaran, le financement des expéditions est très apprécié, et considéré comme un acte très noble.</p><h1>EXPÉDITIONS D’ENTREPRISE</h1><p>Certaines des plus grandes entreprises sont toujours à l’affût des technologies oubliées. Cela peut prendre plusieurs formes. Des recherches historiques sur d’anciens volumes et bases de données peuvent révéler des rumeurs à propos d’installations cachées.</p><p>Un autre moyen consiste également à envoyer des expéditions d’indépendants et de mercenaires vers les systèmes extérieurs. Dans le but de minimiser les risques pour l’entreprise, ce sont des indépendants qui dirigent ces expéditions, cependant un employé ou un scientifique appartenant à la société les accompagne toujours afin de protéger les découvertes.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":0,"name":"Le Conseil","type":"image","_id":"8MvdBREgGU5OYF77","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"worlds/coriolis/img/guide/conseil-membres.jpg","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1681222043070,"modifiedTime":1681739962912,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"_id":"htBsd9p8TAYecmJN"}

In the Core below you will find Administrative Services, the Coriolis Guard, and the Judicators. The Cellar, the largest part of the station, has no government.</h3><h4>THE GOVERNOR</h4><p>The Governor is the ruler of Coriolis and the one who is ultimately responsible for its operations and security. The Governor has personal control of the Coriolis Guard who patrol the station and the nearby space. In the end, the Governor answers to the Council of Factions, but gets a vote on the Council in return. The Governor is elected by the Popular Assembly to serve for a term of four years. “Anyone can become Governor” is a popular idea on Coriolis, but in reality, it is only the faction-sponsored candidates that stand a chance. The Consortium’s candidate is always the one who is most likely to win. Formally, the Governor is independent from the factions – if one is to believe such things.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GOVERNOR KEMAL DARGOSIAN</h5><p>The current Governor of Coriolis, Kemal Dargosian, is a man everyone seems to have an opinion on. Some say that he is a drunk who does nothing but throw parties in the Seraglio, but he has actually done a pretty good job of keeping the Council together through the turbulent times just after the arrival of the Emissary. Everyone is in agreement that he does the Consortium’s biddings, however.</p><h4>THE COUNCIL OF FACTIONS</h4><p>The legally acknowledged factions in the Horizon gather in the Council of Factions on Coriolis. The purpose of the Council is, according to its by-laws, to “prevent and resolve conflict, and to develop the Horizon”. Each faction has one vote, as has the Governor. The Emissary from Xene has an observer status and cannot vote. After a vote in the Council, the outcome is made public, but not how the individual factions voted. It is usually pretty easy to deduce this anyway from listening to the factions’ council members’ statements before and after the vote, but not always. The example of the vote on whether the Emissary should be granted observer status or not illustrates this: at least seven of the thirteen votes were needed for the motion to pass, but afterwards, eight factions spoke out in disappointment over the results. The Council usually presents a unified front however, with a smiling Governor who speaks of peace and understanding on the Bulletin shows. The Council can leave a decision to the Popular Assembly, but if they do, they have to follow the voice of the Assembly. This means that the Assembly is a tool mainly used to threaten or manipulate other factions on a specific issue, but a few insignificant matters are passed along to the Assembly each cycle so they won’t feel left out.</p><h4>THE POPULAR ASSEMBLY</h4><p>When the Council of Factions is in doubt about the will of the people, they can ask the help of the Popular Assembly – although in reality, this rarely happens on any important issues. The Assembly always gets a say in legislative matters, however. This makes the Assembly a double-edged sword that on the one hand can be used to legitimize the decisions of the Council, but on the other hand could have the complete opposite effect. The members of the Assembly have not been elected – they are Coriolis’ 2001 taxpayers. 732 of them are wealthy individuals and the rest represent different companies or lobby groups.</p><h4>THE BUREAUCRACY</h4><p>The massive bureaucracy that executes the decisions made higher up and which handles the daily affairs is a department of the government called Administrative Services. “Admin”, as it is often called, is located in the center pillar of the Core and it consists of a staff of bureaucrats divided into tiers. The three at the top are the chief bureaucrats sometimes called before the Council or the Assembly to defend their department or to write new memos regarding the station’s operations. Admin handles all the myriad of different licenses that exist on the station.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.11 THE COUNCIL OF FACTIONS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>REPRESENTATIVE</th><th>FACTION</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kemal Dargosian</td><td>Governor, formally independent</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Terminos Lete</td><td>Ahlam’s Temple</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mandragor Ho</td><td>The Draconites</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jesibel Niales</td><td>The Free League</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wasimah Umm</td><td>The Church of the Icons</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tiera Yriedes</td><td>The Consortium</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Harnek Mara</td><td>The Consortium (The Bulletin)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Desaron Kai</td><td>The Consortium (The Colonial Agency)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Morwan Pasa</td><td>The Consortium (The Foundation)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Suhaima Taslim</td><td>The Legion</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sister Almas</td><td>The Order of the Pariah</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Johar Quassar</td><td>The Zenithian Hegemony</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Emissary</td><td>Xene, observer</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>THE CORIOLIS GUARD</h4><p>The police force on the station is the Legion-affiliated Coriolis Guard which is responsible for both internal and external security, as well as firefighting and emergency medical transport. The Guard’s most important job is to keep the streets peaceful and to sentence criminals with the proper fines and corporal punishment. Arrests are rarely made, and only when someone is to be handed over to the Judicators. The Guard despises the Judicators who they think are arrogant and authoritarian, a view shared by much of the station’s general population. The situation is not made better by the fact that the Judicators can order the Guard around, but the Guard can only ask the Judicators for help.</p><h4>THE JUDICATORS</h4><p>The Judicators are the criminal courts’ own detectives used to investigate serious crime. All judicators are recruited from the officers’ and pilots’ ranks in the Monolith and then given special training in the Judicators’ Forensics Institute in the Core. Judicators have far-reaching mandates: they can sentence criminals at the scene of the crime just like the Guard, but can also issue orders to both the Guard and to civilians. They are free to sentence a criminal to whatever punishment they see fit – even death, as long as they can explain themselves to the courts afterwards. They can detain, arrest, and interrogate freely, and in theory use torture. A new paradigm in interrogation techniques, based on the teachings of Ahlam, has limited the use of torture however, as the truthfulness of the confessions they produce has been questioned.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/rättskipare_coriolis.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">Judicator Ninhe Xavor</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.12 GUARDS AND JUDICATORS</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.12 Guards and Judicators]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Lefner</td><td>Guard</td><td>Moustache, scarred</td><td>Looking menacing</td><td>Power</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Menjah</td><td>Guard</td><td>Gang tattoo</td><td>Making friendly small talk</td><td>Duty</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Kander</td><td>Inspector</td><td>Hollow-eyed</td><td>Eating</td><td>Retirement</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jour</td><td>Guard</td><td>Medals on the uniform</td><td>Accepting a bribe</td><td>Birr</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Ninhe</td><td>Judicator</td><td>Tall</td><td>On the lookout</td><td>The law</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Alexis</td><td>Judicator</td><td>Red cape</td><td>Making an arrest</td><td>The people</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>THE COURTS</h4><p>The criminal courts of Coriolis are separate from the Governor and the government. They enforce the laws created by the Council and the Assembly. In reality however, the courts are accommodating when it comes to sensitive cases, involving factionaries for example. The courts oversee the Judicators according to the idea that it is the preservation of law and order on the station that is important, not necessarily the methods.</p><h4>CRIME</h4><p>Despite the efforts of the Guard and the Judicators, crime is widespread on the station. It is most noticeable around the four plazas on the Ring and in the Mulukhad, all places where the gangs of the Syndicate operate. The Guard and the Judicators try to keep a low profile here so as not to provoke confrontation unless innocents are in danger, although they have a rather wide definition of “innocent”. The Cellar has no police presence whatsoever, but then again, civilized people never go down there.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>PRISONS</h5><p>There are no actual prisons on Coriolis, only a central jail in the headquarters of the Coriolis Guard and smaller detention centers in the Guard stations of “hot” areas. Violent maniacs are given to the Samaritan Sanatorium where they are supposedly locked up in tiny cells on the lower levels.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRIME IN THE MULUKHAD</h5><p>The Adibal family, which is a member of the Syndicate, runs the gambling district on Coriolis. They cooperate with the Guard to maintain some level of order. Too much chaos would damage their lucrative betting and gambling operations. The judicators here are mainly concerned with tracking down corrupt bureaucrats and members of the Guard.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRIME ON THE SPICE PLAZA</h5><p>The Afyana family runs this plaza through their gang Ganiyas with the Guard’s silent blessing. The Judicators are in turn very active here as this is where much of the drug running on the station starts.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  CRIME ON THE SPRING PLAZA</h5><p>The Spring Plaza is always nice and quiet; this is something the Syndicate family Intisaar has their gang, Izza, work very hard to achieve. The Guard is almost completely absent here, but the Judicators keep an eye on the Izza to make sure they don’t get too cocky and demand too much protection money from the merchants on the plaza.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRIME ON THE MARKET PLAZA</h5><p>The Market Plaza is far from safe, as the gang in control, the Wark, is under constant attack from the two Promenade gangs, the Arhama and the Goro. The Rafa family is trying to mediate in the conflict, but to no avail. Shootings, store fires, and other acts of retaliation are common here. The Guard has many patrols in the area, but if they cannot get the situation under control soon, the Judicators will make a move and start to clean up the mess.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRIME ON THE OZONE PLAZA</h5><p>The Legion runs the Ozone Plaza. The Birbasil family keeps a presence here through the black-lipped Lama gang, sure, but they cooperate with the Legionnaires and demand no protection fees from the merchants, instead focusing on weapons and technology smuggling. The Judicators stay away as well unless asked for by the Legion.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRIME IN THE CELLAR</h5><p>The Cellar is only visited by the Guard when they are on one of their purges, rounding up slummers and semi-intelligences for deportation to labor camps of Kua. Many avoid this fate by hiding in the deep part of the station however. The Legion made a proposition to the Council to nerve gas the entire Cellar now and then to be rid of the problem, but the suggestion was leaked to the Assembly and caused an outrage. It was likely the Syndicate who leaked the documents as they use the Cellar for smuggling and secret storage. Every now and then, honest people also need the docks and hangars of the Cellar when the traffic is too heavy out on the Net.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>GUARD STATIONS</h4><p>The Guard stations are the small, local police offices commonly called “karkolu” kept by the Guard in the Core and Ring of the station. They are often run-down, with cracked facades, and ill kept by the tired members of the Guard. One officer with a handful of grunts to do the paperwork normally runs a station. The stations usually have a weapons cabinet and a small drunk tank.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"w8S8Rqe4pxYwRn9s","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3,"6Di8yMnm3jtdNeRI":2},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.3.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265447,"modifiedTime":1684524663320,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"wz390mVwR1sEKuel","sort":0,"_id":"iJRupJavyY9sfpYG"}

Pendant ce temps, vous pouvez tenter un tir normal (au prix de 2 PA) quand vous le voulez, avant que toutes les autres actions ne soient effectuées, même après qu’elles aient été déclarées.</p><p>Si vous et votre adversaire êtes tous deux installés en position d’affût et vous trouvez à l’intérieur de l’arc de tir de l’autre, un test en opposition de TIR (en action libre pour tous les deux) décidera de qui agit en premier.</p><p><strong>Affût compromis</strong> : dès que vous effectuez une action autre que faire feu sur une cible située à l’intérieur de votre arc de tir, vous perdez votre concentration, et par conséquent votre position d’affût.

Thanks to this, many see cybernetic or bionic modification as something bad, or even blasphemous. Extremists on the matter include the Zenithian Hegemony, whose members are obsessed with blood purity, and certain Icon cults such as the Face of Truth on Sadaal.</p><p>To many colonists and mercenaries, however, cybernetic prostheses and mods or bionic sculpts could be the difference between life and death. To the Legionnaires, it is even a status symbol to have prosthetic limbs, cybernetic modifications and scars from wound staples. It also makes them look more menacing – an important trait in their line of work.<br />Specific cybernetic implants and bionic sculpts are handled as both equipment and as talents, and they are described in detail in Chapter 4.</p><h4>BIO SCULPTING</h4><p>Just like cybernetics has its place within certain groups in the Horizon, so does bionic sculpting – although bigots and the narrow-minded strongly disagree. Tattoo Alley next to the Ozone Plaza on Coriolis houses several bio sculptors’ shops. Most customers come for small cosmetic sculpts such as eye shadows, longer eye lashes or more accentuated cheek bones, but sometimes also for more controversial things like longer legs, micro hearts or other exotic mods.</p><p>Bio-sculpting thrives more openly on the independent station Ahalimm and among the nomads, and even sculpts as absurd as wings, tails and gills can be found out in the fringes of the Kua system – things that would cause riots or even lynchings in the core.</p><h4>CYBERNETICS</h4><p>Cybernetic implants are treated as both talents and gear. They will cost you both XP and birr, and require healing after the procedure. During the healing process, the painful wounds give the PC a -2 to all skill tests. All cybernetics are Ordinary technology.</p><p>PCs with cybernetic implants will likely look heavier and larger than others, move somewhat mechanically or stand out in some other way. Cybernetics are hard to hide. If the PCs encounter an NPC with cybernetics, it will probably be fairly obvious to them that the person is modified in some way. Some people, such as legionnaires, choose to make their implants extra visible.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 6.15  CYBERNETIC IMPLANTS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>TALENT</th><th>EXAMPLE OF COMMERCIAL NAME</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Accelerated Reflexes</td><td>Celer-Delekta Flexplant</td></tr><tr><td>Active Sensors</td><td>Nyala Sonar Implant Exxis</td></tr><tr><td>Body Armor</td><td>Nestera Bio Armor MK II</td></tr><tr><td>Endo Skeleton</td><td>Tilides EndoX</td></tr><tr><td>Built-In Weapon</td><td>Xoar Thermal Wrist Indigo</td></tr><tr><td>Weatherproof</td><td>Celer-Delekta Endothermic Capsule</td></tr><tr><td>Skin Electrodes</td><td>Xoar Shockhand</td></tr><tr><td>Com Link</td><td>Hyperion Head Link MK I</td></tr><tr><td>Lie Detector</td><td>Hyperion Linguistic &amp; Socio-Arithmetic Unit</td></tr><tr><td>Cybernetic muscles</td><td>Celer-Delekta Sprintplant</td></tr><tr><td>Targeting Scope</td><td>Nestera AccVision</td></tr><tr><td>Passive Sensors</td><td>Nyala Thermo Sensors</td></tr><tr><td>Voice Amplifier</td><td>Hyperion Larynx Implant MK II</td></tr><tr><td>Servo Locks</td><td>Tilides ServoX</td></tr><tr><td>Language Modulator</td><td>The Foundation’s Linguist Base</td></tr><tr><td>Water Breathing</td><td>Nestra Aqualung Dipridon</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>BIONICS</h4><p>Bionic sculpts are treated as both talents and gear.

On one of Uharu’s forest moons, Tacharuk himself was stricken with a mysterious illness that started as black, bleeding lesions on the skin and ended with him bleeding from every orifice. A person who comes in contact with the disease must pass a force test or become infected. The first lesions show up a few days after the exposure, after which the diseased will suffer 1 point of damage per day until she becomes broken and dies. Only medicurgy with access to the best trauma labs can stop the process.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">HYPER SICKNESS</div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\">Culture Test: <strong>+2</strong></div><p>People who are exposed to the portal fields for too long or without being in stasis will suffer hyper sickness, or “bad stasis” as it is also called. The condition is permanent and comes in many forms, from madness to having one’s mind or limbs twisted by the darkness. The latter can at least be remedied with prostheses. A person traveling through a portal field without stasis rolls D6, a result of 1-2 indicating he has been affected of hyper sickness.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">OASIS DISEASE</div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\">Culture Test: <strong>-1</strong></div><p>A dangerous meme that often strikes in dry environments and deserts is the mind meme called the oasis disease. People who contract the meme will try to keep alleviate their thirst away by drinking water wherever they can find it. They cannot stop drinking. After a few days, their brains swell up and they die unless they are forcefully kept from drinking. Medicurgs alone cannot treat the patient as it takes proxy technology to combat the meme. Exorcisms have supposedly worked in some cases.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">THE DARS’ CURSE</div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\">Culture Test: <strong>-2</strong></div><p>On Dabaran and in the upper classes on Coriolis, an affliction called the Dars’ Curse is beginning to spread. The effect of the meme is that its victim becomes extremely haughty and arrogant. The victim gets a -2 to manipulation. The meme is curable, but the victim is generally not interested in being cured. The origins of the curse are debated, though some scholars believe that it mainly affects people that have visited the Wound and looked down into its vast emptiness.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Xgw9bNwMCR8Gev40","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265802,"modifiedTime":1680376265802,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A3nQWxGXvH8Aj35T","sort":0,"_id":"kuZmpgZWzaeAxnB9"}

Finally, a few possible endings are described together with suggestions for the jump to Act 2.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>The PCs have made their way to the largest spaceport on Coriolis after receiving a mysterious message from a close friend or relative studying at one of the station’s academies asking for help. While waiting for the meeting, Iconic intervention leads to an encounter with a mystic on the run who informs the PCs that their friend has gone missing and that she herself is being hunted by armed men. The PCs realize that their friend’s disappearance and the fleeing mystic are connected, and clues found at the university point toward an unemployed deckhand, Aram Yafa, whom they eventually track down. Just as they find out that Aram has helped an unknown group to kidnap mystics on the station, the news breaks about the Emissary having disappeared from its Spire residence. Riots break out in the Core. If the PCs encountered the mystic Khomina during The Last Voyage of the Ghazali, they might try to contact her – only to find that she too has gone missing.</p><h4>KEY INSIGHTS</h4><p>There are a few key insights and clues that the PCs must have acquired before they can move on to Act 2:</p><ul><li>A large number of mystics have either been murdered or have gone missing during the last segment on the station.</li><li>The perpetrators have been impersonating members of the Guard, but their motives or where they are taking the mystics are unknown.</li><li>The Samaritan Sanatorium in the Core keeps coming up in the investigation, and would be a good place to continue the search.</li></ul><p>If you can, try to make the PCs feel as though time is running out – many innocent lives are in the balance and only their actions can save them. You can use the timeline of the nine days leading up to the Cyclade to gradually escalate the conflict and the number of disappearing mystics. Keep the tempo high, and try to take the PCs through the first scenario in a few days, so that a majority of the time is instead spent on Kua.</p><h4>IMPORTANT CHARACTERS</h4><p>Act 1 will see the PCs try to grasp the scope of the conspiracy. They will interact with a few key NPCs, and might encounter some of the independent actors.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Althea] – Hunted stevedore and mystic (page 19)</li><li>@Actor[Aram Yafa] – Deckhand and bait for the martyr strike team (page 31)</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INDEPENDENT ACTORS</h5><ul><li>@Actor[Merk Ahuro] – Corrupt inspector of the Guard (page 21)</li><li>@Actor[Jeyla Kuhari] – Nosy journalist (page 32)</li></ul><h4>DARKNESS POINTS</h4><p>In this act, DP can be used to make key situations tougher, but you should go easy on the PCs until they have found their direction in the story.

The final installation in quadrant 4 is the last one to visit. Its readouts obscured by the electromagnetic storm, going there in person is the only way to get a complete readout.</p><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>In the final Act, the events all move things toward the arrival of the Emissaries. These beings are the Santulans – leaders of the Second Horizon’s ruling body, the Symmetry. They are looking for a way to transfer their minds into new bodies. To traverse the dark void without the use of physical portals, and position themselves for the ongoing war with the First Horizon’s agents. The most important event in this Act is the last one: the Emissaries (see page 226 @JournalEntry[01 - Descent to Xene]). The other events are only ways to get to that point, hopefully by defusing an ongoing conflict.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LAST QUADRANT</h5><p>The final installation is below Xene’s belt of debris. Quadrant 4 has been blocked out by the electromagnetic disturbances, but is unharmed in other regards. On their way in, the shuttle rocks back and forth from the turbulence. Its hull is being battered by the particles bombarding it. Systems are barely holding together. For 1 DP, the GM can force a pilot roll where failure means 2 points of Hull damage and a potential emergency landing.</p><ul><li><strong>The Platform</strong>: Once they land on the platform, they realize the rig is floating right in the eye of the storm. A calm oasis surrounded by swirling walls of solid, yellow clouds, crackling with lightning. The chance of getting out again looks bleak, unless the storm dissipates.</li><li><strong>The Pattern</strong>: Checking the sensor data and the pattern brings good news. The pattern in Xene’s current magnetic field is almost the same as the Jarouma Pattern detected from the Web of Izar in the Erequ system nearly two Coriolis Cycles ago.</li><li><strong>Bad News</strong>: However, looking at the weather station readouts (data djinn or science), the team realizes that there is a problem. Leaving through the storm will be almost impossible, and the weather prognosis indicates that the storm will not dissipate for many segments, maybe even a whole cycle. The atmosphere on Xene has somehow permanently been changed by the experiment.</li><li><strong>Panic</strong>: As this news spreads among the team, everyone risks taking 3 Mind Points of damage unless they succeed with a Wits roll. Each success removes one MP of the damage. If anyone becomes broken by this, the GM can use 1 DP to add an additional Mind Point of damage to all team members. Dread and panic arise!<br />The purpose here is to put the team in a position of doubt, anger, blame, and fear of death.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0, 1–2 DP (Mandatory if team hasn’t panicked yet)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RISE FROM THE DEAD</h5><p>Mid-argument, or on their way to the next installation, a person believed to be dead or dying suddenly comes to life. With a spasmodic jerk and a terrifying scream, the team member tumbles onto the floor. Then, equally suddenly, they stop spasming, and stand up slowly. Looking around, they nod and blink, confused. They look like they are uncertain of their whereabouts (the person has been taken over by an Emissary.)</p><ul><li><strong>Dread</strong>: As this happens, everyone risks taking 1 Mind Point of damage unless they succeed with a Wits roll. If anyone becomes broken by this, the GM can use 1 DP to add an additional Mind Point of damage to all team members.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE EMISSARIES</h5><p>When the time is right, in conflict, mid-drama, one by one the team members are taken over by the Symmetry. The mystics’ minds travel across the void and enter the bodies of the Xene expedition. Performing any action, once the process has started, requires a successful EMPATHY roll. Failure results in the victim taking 1 Mind Point of stress. Being taken over is a terrifying process, and once the Mind Points of a victim reach 0, their body and mind are completely taken over. Rolls for EMPATHY can only prolong the process, buying time to talk, or act. Let the Emissaries arrive one by one. Take over characters who are the most threatening, either to themselves or to others. Break up conflicts.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (mandatory)</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/05-song/EMISSARIERNA.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>MORE ABOUT THE SYMMETRY</h5><p>The Santulans are the Symmetry’s most knowledgable mystics. They have let their minds wander between the stars across the great expanse – from the Second Horizon to new host bodies among the expedition members at Xene – thus turning them into the Emissaries. Read more about them on page 185 @JournalEntry[05 - Ending Act III], 191 and 193 @JournalEntry[02 - Mission Generator], as well as in the Atlas Compendium, page 24 @JournalEntry[07 - History of the Horizon].</p></div><p></p><div class=\"blueheader\">THE TAKEN</div><br />Following the lore of the Mercy of the Icons campaign, these are the Symmetry mystics who take over the expedition’s team members:<p></p><ul><li><strong>Faisal Kham, Icon</strong>: The Merchant, Symmetry mystic: Hiam en-Lamra</li><li><strong>Leila Hatami, Icon</strong>: The Faceless, Symmetry mystic: Chera en-Megrina</li><li><strong>Yorûg om-Khalit, Icon</strong>: The Judge, Symmetry mystic: Tam en-Daneer</li><li><strong>Alam Dania, Icon</strong>: The Messenger, Symmetry mystic: Urni en-Argonnas</li><li><strong>Harish Verma, Icon</strong>: The Dancer, Symmetry mystic: Aisha en-Barka</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>MERCY OF THE ICONS</h4><p>These are the prominent steps of the mind intrusion:</p><ol><li>Enter: Suddenly a sharp pain is felt as the mystic’s presence enters the victim’s mind.

Take 1 MP of damage.</li><li>Adjust: Senses begin fading, and become unfocused, as a bright light and high-pitched sounds take over. The victim takes 2 MP of damage.</li><li>Control: The body can no longer be controlled. It behaves of its own accord. Someone else has it standing up, speaking calming words to the rest of the party. Take 1 MP of damage. As long as the character isn’t broken she can still hear and see what is going on.</li><li>Broken: After this, the victim takes 1 MP per minute, until they are broken.

Before they have time to recover from the crash and search for clues, smugglers from Ramses' Jackals arrive turning the situation into a deadly threat.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs have crashlanded in the Kuan jungles close to two other drop pods containing nine occupied stasis pods (see Events). After briefly examining the pods, the Jackals arrive. The smugglers will immediately attack the PCs if they spot them. Close to the crashsite, two Shaukar scouts are watching from the shadows. Their role in this scene is limited, but their being there will be important later in the scenario as they will tell their superiors about the PCs.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>In this scene, it is important that the PCs figure out that the Jackals have collected prisoners from the earlier drop pods (including the Emissary and Noor) for further transport:</p><ul><li>The cargo is brought to Baybasin, the closest outpost beyond Verkâna Ridge.</li></ul><p>The PCs can find this out in several ways, for example through one of these three methods:</p><ul><li><strong>Interrogation</strong>: The PCs can capture and interrogate a Jackal member who can tell them that the group operates out of Baybasin and also describe how to get there.</li><li><strong>Conversation</strong>: Directions to Baybasin can be aquired from the guerilla scouts or from Verkâna locals (see the Eyes and Ears scene on page 108 @JournalEntry[02 - Eyes and Ears]). If the PCs are unsure of how to proceed, introduce the Shaukar scouts and have them tell the group about spotting the Jackals moving stasis pods to Baybasin.</li><li><strong>Tracking</strong>: If the PCs are skilled in either observation or survival, they can track the smugglers through the jungles themselves. Alternatively, they can plant a tracker on one of the pods using technology and wait for the smugglers to lead the way to their hideout.</li></ul><h4>THE DROP PODS</h4><p>The PCs will be bruised and sore from the crash. The pods are described in the last chapter of the previous scenario (page 87 @JournalEntry[04 - The Martyr's Embrace]). As they climb out of the wreckage, the first thing they spot is that the pods pulse with a red light. The flashing red beacon also contains an encrypted message from Salamah to Artyr Gholâm. The message can be decrypted by passIng a demanding (–1) <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">technology</strong> test (see the handout below).</p><h4>THE CRASH SITE</h4><p>The crash site is located in a valley below a steep slope. The surrounding hills are covered in thick undergrowth, interwoven layers of roots and thick vines. Thick trees with wide crowns grow in the valley, providing a perfect cover for the drop pods.</p>@JournalEntry[The Crash Site Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FOREST</h5><p>The trees here have massive, pyramid-shaped root systems supporting huge, dark trunks. Walking or climbing through the valley is difficult – the undergrowth is tough, deep holes and sharp rocks are hidden under it, and the roots are wet and slippery. The valley has been used for quite some time however, and the combination of earlier landings and the Jackals' crawlers has created paths between the trees. The area is littered with debris and mangled trees and plants.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DITCHES</h5><p>Two shallow, overgrown ditches near the crash site are filled with mud and moss. The Jackals have hidden older pods here that they haven’t been able to haul away, planning to sell them at a later time.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DROP PODS</h5><p>There are currently two unopened pods at the crash site. One sits in a clearing in the middle of the valley, but the other has slid down the slope toward one of the ditches and become entangled in a thick net of branches and vines, making it harder to reach. Passing a demanding (–1) <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">survival</strong> or <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong> test allows the PCs to clear a path down the slope to the drop pod, and two people may then test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong> to unload one stasis pod at a time. The Jackals use portable cranes and winches on their crawlers to unload the pods.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HEIGHTS</h5><p>The crash site is being watched by the two Shaukar scouts, Haquim and Aqueda, sent there by officer Dali Osman. Their orders are to observe only, but they may become involved in the scene anyway.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>This scene introduces Ramses’ Jackals.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Ramses' Jackals - Algolan]</li><li>@Actor[Ramses' Jackals - Sogio]</li><li>@Actor[Ramses' Warhounds]</li><li>@Actor[Ramses]</li><li>@Actor[Haquim]</li><li>@Actor[Aqueda]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>As the GM, make sure that the PCs have a chance to find clues and information about the pods, but keep the tempo rapid. For further drama, you could decide not to give them enough time to search all the stasis pods. They might catch a glimpse of someone they believe tp be the Emissary just as they are interrupted by the arrival of the Jackals. Below is a list of events to use in the scene.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DROP PODS</h5><p>The PCs get to search the area around the crash site briefly before the Jackals arrive (see the crash site map).</p><ul><li><strong>The Beacons</strong>: The pods have built-in beacons that flash red and transmit coordinates and a message. An effortless (+2) data djinn test is required to extract the coordinates and read the message on a computer, communicator, or pod monitor. Shutting off the beacon is also very easy (technology +2). Apart from getting the coordinates, the PCs can also read Salamah ach-Abaud’s last message to Artyr Gholâm (see the description of the crash site above).</li><li><strong>Loading Area</strong>: The area around the crashed pods has been used by the smugglers on several occasions, and is covered in tracks from vehicles, animals, and people. Tracks lead from here to the two ditches. Hidden in the ditches are scraps and remains of broken pods, covered in fast-growing vines and bushes.</li><li><strong>The Stasis Pods</strong>: Both drop pods contain stasis units. The pod in the clearing is occupied by five people on ice – three mystics and two non-mystics (destined for the slave markets). The pod in the ditch was the last one out and its coordinates were somewhat hastily calculated, which explains the unlucky landing. It contains four beds, three of which contain mystics and one with a non-mystic occupant.</li><li><strong>Marked Cargo</strong>: The stasis units in the pods are marked with black and white numbers. Most of them (six pods) have black numbers – denoting mystic cargo – and three have white numbers (non-mystics). The markings are there to guide the stevedores in Baybasin and Little Algol.</li><li><strong>Stasis Profiles</strong>: The beds have their own batteries with rather unique energy signatures. If the PCs have some form of sensor equipment, they can detect the energy signatures with a successful technolgy test (see box below).</li></ul>@JournalEntry[Message to Artyr]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  BEFORE THE AMBUSH</h5><p>Shutting off one or more of the pod beacons will delay the arrival of Ramses' Jackals, giving the PCs more time to examine the crash site, but the smugglers will then be more cautious when they arrive. Give the PCs a chance to notice the incoming warband:</p><ul><li>The low whining sound of quickly approaching energy turbines can be heard (successful observation test) as well as the rumbling of some form of crawler vehicle (critical success).</li></ul><p>Depending on how the PCs choose to handle the situation, they will either be ambushed (see the Ambush! Event below) or have a chance to plan an ambush of their own. They can of course choose to avoid combat altogether and shadow the Jackals back to their camp instead (see Tailing the Smugglers below). The smuggler group consists of:</p><ul><li>Three Algolan smugglers with five warhounds (kept in a cage in the crawler).</li><li>Two Sogoi.</li><li>Two hover scooters (see @Item[Grav bike], Coriolis core rulebook page 118).</li><li>One jungle crawler (see sand @Item[Crawler], Coriolis core rulebook page 117) equipped with a crane and a gravcraft for loading.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SENSOR TRACKING</h4><p>If the PCs have a personal sensor, it can be programmed to track the energy signature of one of the stasis beds with a successful DATA DJINN test. The sensor must be set to active mode, which will make the group easier to detect in return (+2 to OBSERVATION for opponents trying to spot the PCs using sensors). It is also possible to modify an environment scanner or a communicator (class III or above) for the task, but this requires a hard (–2) TECHNOLOGY test to accomplish, and failure risks damaging the device. If the PCs manage to track the stasis beds, they can follow the trail all the way to Baybasin and through the river delta. If the group is slow, you can tell them how the signal becomes fainter and have them test DATA DJINN to recalibrate.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PREMATURE THAWING</h5><p>A prisoner in one of the stasis beds wakes up, but the lid won’t open. She starts to panic and pounds the glass, screaming, but the sounds are muffled and barely audible. Will the PCs save the person? Will the frightened prisoner activate her mystical powers? At the cost of 1 DP, you can decide to have the freshly thawed abductee attack the PCs with a mystic power, or wander off, possibly alerting the smugglers that something has gone wrong.</p><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TAILING THE SMUGGLERS</h5><p>The smugglers arrive oblivious to the presence of the PCs. The PCs should have a little time to examine the pods before this. It is when the vehicles roll into the clearing and the smugglers jump out to carry out their task, which by now has become very much a routine affair, that they might spot the unwelcome guests. The situation will escalate quickly and turn into a firefight unless the PCs can come up with some brilliant lie to fool the smugglers. An insane (–3) manipulation test is required to dupe Ramses and his soldiers. The Jackals have come to collect the stasis units and then hide the drop pods in the ditches.

He instructs the Algolans to closely surround the PCs and cover the clearing with a Vulcan crossfire while he delivers the killshots with his acc rifle from Long range (shots from farther away are impossible due to the topography of the area). He will climb the ridge opposite to the Shaukar scouts.</p><p>Cost: 3 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><p>THE ICON’S LAMENT<br />A herald born of flames, dreaming of life.<br />By lightning smote and bound, in shackles cold as ice.</p><p>– Nabi-mu-Qad, the Messenger Emissary</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SHAUKAR SCOUTS</h5><p>The Shaukar scouts are hiding nearby but the PCs just might spot them anyhow, which should tell them that the smugglers aren’t the only active group in the area.

The prisoners come from all corners of the Horizon, and traveled to Kua with dreams of a better life on Coriolis, only to be drugged and abducted when they got there. If they are questioned, three of the prisoners marked with black crosses will reluctantly admit to having experienced symptoms of the so-called mystic’s disease. If the PCs are fair to the prisoners and treat them with respect, it is possible that the Shaukar scouts reveal themselves and offer their assistance, for example by showing them the way to Baybasin or by offering to take the prisoners to a secret guerilla camp on the ridge to enable the PCs to continue their hunt.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"AC50LiDvHcVbn0D5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296243,"modifiedTime":1682695296243,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"rCD14X1CtExeUz12","sort":0,"_id":"mYDGItUYQoQJlrlL"}

The palaces of the Monolith, the gleaming spires of the factory complexes, and the moldy river barges are all locations full of intrigue and conflict, but also possibilities, which only strengthen Kua’s role as one of the leading planets in the Horizon.</h3><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/kua_2.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>FACTS ABOUT KUA</h4><ul><li><strong>DIAMETER</strong>: 12,578 km</li><li><strong>EQUATORIAL CIRCUMFERENCE</strong>: 39,495 km</li><li><strong>SURFACE AREA</strong>: 510 million square kilometers</li><li><strong>GRAVITY</strong>: 1 standard gravity</li><li><strong>DAY LENGTH</strong>: 26 hours</li><li><strong>SIDEREAL YEAR</strong>: 336 days</li><li><strong>AXIAL TILT</strong>: 3 degrees</li></ul></div><p><strong>Before the arrival</strong> of the Zenithian arkship, Kua was a backwater planet. None of the groups that later would become factions had their bases here. The native Sogoi and other Firstcome peoples were the only inhabitants of the green jungle world. A few expeditions from Dabaran and Algol had attempted to examine the gigantic stone pillar that stretched all the way up through the clouds and had founded some smaller settlements, but overall, the dangers of the dark jungles were too great for the planet to be of any interest for large-scale investments.</p><h4>THE FIRSTCOME</h4><p>The Firstcome on Kua are almost exclusively different nomadic peoples that live in the jungles around the equator. The most well-known group is the Sogoi, a proud tribe of warriors and trackers. The Sogoi are the group that the Zenithians and their allies exploit the hardest on the plantations, and they are the majority group in the Conglomerate slums.</p><h4>THE ZENITHIANS</h4><p>The arrival of the Zenith changed the fate of Kua forever. The “empty” planet was deemed a possible home for the sleeping colonists. What happened next is history. A quick and well-planned mutiny, led by what would later become the Draconites, divided the crew. The different groups that formed in the chaos were all given reasonable materials and technology to found colonies of their own, but the Quassars, the captain’s family, made sure the best ships and resources stayed with them. The Quassars led the group known today as the Zenithian Hegemony down to the planet below the Zenith, to a place on the equator where a curious black monolith rose from the jungle. Through silver-tongued negotiation and superior firepower, they quickly subdued the Algolan trade colony Sheva that was constructed around the base of the column. The Algolan colonists were hired as agents for the Zenithians. The city that began to grow around the black obelisk attracted fortune seekers and colonists from all across the Horizon, and eventually evolved into a giant amalgamation of new and old buildings, quickly losing its original name and becoming known only as “the Conglomerate”.</p><h4>THE JUNGLE</h4><p>“The jungle is Kua, and Kua is the jungle” is a Sogoi saying that sums up the general view of Kua in the Horizon: heat, damp, rain, and gigantic trees are what make up the jungles that cover most of the planet. The jungles are inhabited by wild beasts, crazed Firstcome tribes and, if the holodramas are to be believed, mighty Portal Builder relics. The immensely popular Bulletin series, The Plantation Owner’s Daughter, is set on Kua, and this is usually where most people’s knowledge of the planet ends. Life deep in the jungles is a completely different world from the city life in the Conglomerate or elsewhere. Every day is a struggle against the wild forces of nature in the form of heavy rains, monsoon storms, and flash floods, as well as more slowly eroding effects such as damp, rust, mold, and the diseases that thrive in the humid climate. But the jungles can also be benevolent, with their rich supply of fruits, lumber, and other raw materials.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE SOGOI</h4><p>The Sogoi are a proud people who view themselves as the true heirs to Kua. Their stories describe how they turned their back on the stars to lead a simple life in the jungles, and they regard their way of life as the opposite of the hubris of the arrogant Zenithians.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>REBELS AND MERCENARIES</h5><p>Nature is not the only danger in the jungles. Many of society’s outcasts have banded together and live as raiders or rebels here. They can be freedom fighters from the slummers’ movement in the Conglomerate or Syndicate mercenaries guarding opor factories. Either way, running into them will most likely end in death or imprisonment. The exceptions are some of the rebel groups that fight for the rights of the plebeians who live around the Monolith. The 3rd Popular Brigade under general Zasra Namoul targets only the corporations, mainly their enemies in the Nestera defense forces led by Colonel Jamina Abram.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EKILIBRI</h5><p>Ekilibri are small, lemur-like semi-intelligences that can be trained to work on plantations. They are indigenous to the planet and roamed wild in the jungles before the Sogoi began training them. Some zoologists say that the ekilibri are much smarter than they let on, but the slummers who have seen the little creatures rummage through the Conglomerate’s garbage piles know that scientists can’t be trusted. A rare variant is the silver furred ekilibri who are popular pets because of their beauty and docility. Silver furred ekilibri are considered a status symbol both on Coriolis and in the Monolith.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"qzdTgszrp7Axqj25","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266016,"modifiedTime":1680376266016,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"mzbN6SF5SK0UWjxD"}

You are individuals, each with your own roles and tasks, unique attributes and traits, relationships and dreams. In Coriolis – The Third Horizon, you create your PC and write everything about him or her down on a character sheet. A character sheet can be found at the back of this book for you to make copies of, and on the Free League website. The website also provides free downloads of character sheets. The next chapter will help you create your PC. But your PCs are not everything; in Coriolis, your spaceship is your most prized possession. Use the ship sheet, also at the back of the book and available for free download to keep track of what happens to your craft.</p><h5>Dice</h5><p>You decide what your PC does, but if your actions are especially risky, the GM will ask you for a dice roll to determine if you are successful or not. Treat your dice well, because out there in the darkness, whether you live or die will sometimes come down to chance.</p><h5>Maps and plans</h5><p>Inside the front cover of the book you will find a map of the Third Horizon, to use when you plan your space travel. Several detailed ship plans are also provided in Chapter 7. Use these to get an overview of your, or someone else’s, spaceship. Both maps and ship plans are free to download from our website.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"uYwVVzK085WzwxSZ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266966,"modifiedTime":1680592687070,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hLmLEmsMKNBiOsUN","sort":0,"_id":"n0jdmCrdEAaMPBn4"}

To the public, the faction is best known for their inimitable courtesans.</h3><p><strong>Like the Seekers</strong>, Ahlam’s Temple is an old cult, but instead of the religious traditions of the Seekers or the Church, the Temple’s foundation is the eternal importance of the present. To the Temple, the Icons represent the human soul’s different positions, both spiritual and physical. Just like the Church of the Icons, the Temple seeks to spread their philosophies. The knowledge of the purity of the present will help the people of the Horizon lead better lives. The teachings of Ahlam are applied to everything from dance and art, to judiciary theory and politics. The Judicators’ interrogation methods, which don’t use torture, are based on an Ahlamite theory. The origins of the teachings stem from Miran temple dances and poems from before the Portal Wars. Esteemed philosophers like Haraman Hassam and poets like Jasmine Sidat developed the heritage into the Temple of Ahlam of today.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE COURTESANS</h5><p>The Temple is mainly famous for the courtesan academies they run on Coriolis and Mira. The education there is completely focused on the eight arts of pleasure. Apart from the courtesans, many influential rhetoricians, prophets, entertainers and officers have attended the academies. Both the Zenithian Hegemony and the Bulletin regularly send employees and aristocrats to the academies to be taught the mysteries of subjectivity and sensory input.</p><p>True courtesans are only taught in the academies, and begin their education at an early age. Only the best students complete the program and get their titles. On Coriolis and in other metropolises, true courtesans are in high demand. In some places it would be unthinkable to enter the political arena without a courtesan by one’s side. Wealthy families and recently even the big corporations employ a personal aesthete to show off their status. A part of the Temple less spoken of is the Black Lotuses, courtesans who have been trained in the ninth art – the pleasure of death.<br />These assassins played a crucial role in the destruction of the Nazareem’s Sacrifice, but how active they really are today is uncertain to outsiders.</p><p>Aside from Terminos Lete, the faction’s council member, the Temple is home to famous people like Hija Goua, the bi-gender courtesan from Menele, the war dancer Palmira Ferex from Mira, and Darkes Lamann, the slum poet who in his wall poems mocks rulers and plebeians alike. The Temple possesses an ancient technology – the proxy technology. It was designed for therapeutic and educational purposes and lets you share another person’s experiences and knowledge. Unfortunately, the Syndicate has stolen the technology and uses it to manufacture so-called proxy trips. These are usually of an erotic nature, but rumors are going around about “moru trips” that let you experience someone else’s death. The Temple is fighting to get their technology back, but have had no success so far.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/AhlamsTempel_fraktion.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AHLAM’S MEMATURGY</h5><p>Aside from the proxy technology, rumors say that the philosophers of the Temple can create memes of their own. By manipulating light, sound and bio signals the so-called mematurgs can make people believe or do things that are not true to their nature.</p><p>For the philosophers and teachers of the Temple, the use of memes is just a means to an end, a way to achieve enlightenment, although the same memes could be used to control people. It is not without reason that the saying goes “a courtesan’s whisper is a bond for any man or woman.” Rumors say that the Black Lotuses of the faction are trained to use simple verbal memes. Other examples exist of mematurgs, such as the famous tyrant Dziban, who controls parts of the Dziban system with his followers. Tales of the Djinni also say that they can sow thoughts into the minds of people.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE LOTUS DEAL</h5><p>A “lotus deal” is a common idiom in the Horizon and describes secret problem-solving or underhanded negotiations. It can also be used to insinuate that someone has gone to bed with someone to get a position or a favor.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"ijnp16hRECoYU6qx","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265106,"modifiedTime":1680376265106,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"ntz5XWY29N1IzdLu"}

Where are you from? How did you grow up? Are you a normal human or a humanite? The answers will be the foundation on which to build your PC.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Origin</h5><p>Origin means both which star system you come from, and whether you’re of the Firstcome or a Zenithian. An important part of the Third Horizon’s history is the two waves of colonization that have swept across the systems. The Firstcome have been living in the Horizon for hundreds of years, but have been isolated from each other for a long time. The Zenithians are newcomers who have opened up the trade routes and furthered contact between the systems once again. Roll to determine your home planet on table 2.1 on the next page. Your origin has no mechanical effect; it merely tells you something about who your PC is.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Zenithians And The Firstcome</h5><p>Zenithians often have a pragmatic view of the world, and place their trust in science as much as in the whims of the Icons. They regard themselves as being more modern than the superstitious Firstcome, and claim to be the champions of success, progress and leadership. The Firstcome, on the other hand, view themselves as more spiritual and with a deeper connection to the Icons than the Zenithians. For the Firstcome, both close and extended family matters greatly, and old myths from many generations back take precedence over modern history. Read more about Zenithians and Firstcome in Chapter 10.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 2.1 HOME SYSTEM</h4><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>System</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>ALGOL</strong> – a planet of rebels, ruined by heavy industry and under draconian Consortium rule.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>MIRA</strong> – the cradle of Firstcome culture, filled with temples, churches and cloister palaces.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><strong>KUA</strong> – the center of the Horizon, home to the space station Coriolis.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><strong>DABARAN</strong> – a barren desert with ravine seraglios, oasis gardens, and domed palaces.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><strong>ZALOS</strong> – deeply devoted to the Icon the Martyr (an incarnation of the Judge), locked in constant civil war with the heathens.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><strong>CHOOSE</strong> – check the map of the Third Horizon and read Chapter 13 for inspiration.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Upbringing</h5><p>Are you from a remote colony in the jungle that now covers a ruined metropolis from the first wave of colonization? Or did you grow up among the traveling nomads, going from station to station, living off odd jobs or selling handicrafts? Perhaps you were born into one of the old Zenithian bloodlines, brought up according to the old traditions?</p><p>You can choose between the upbringings Plebeian, Stationary or Privileged (see table 2.2). The Plebeians are the lower class of the Horizon, workers as well as planetside colonists and nomads. People raised on major space stations or asteroids are called Stationary. The Privileged are the highest of the social strata – bureaucrats and factory owners in the Conglomerate, Dabaran pashas, and wealthy merchants on Coriolis,  pure-blooded Hegemonists in the Monolith.</p><p>Your environment growing up affects many aspects of your PC: your attributes, skills and Reputation score at the start of the game, as well as your starting capital.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 2.2 UPBRINGING</h4><table><thead><tr><th>UPBRINGING</th><th>PLEBEIAN</th><th>STATIONARY</th><th>PRIVILEGED</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ATTRIBUTE POINTS</td><td>15</td><td>14</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>SKILL POINTS</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>REPUTATION</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>STARTING CAPITAL</td><td>500 birr</td><td>1,000 birr</td><td>5,000 birr</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Jessica is creating the PC Sabah, Trailblazer and Prospector. Sabah is of a Firstcome origin with a Stationary background, born and raised on Kua. As a Stationary, her Reputation score is 4, and her chosen character concept Trailblazer will not modify this.</em></p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Humanites</h5><p>Not everyone in the Horizon is a normal human, or a “pure-blood” as the older Hegemonists would say. Some groups of people are biosculpted. These “humanites”, as they are called, are often found in primitive tribes on distant planets or abandoned space stations. Common folk view the humanites as sub-human and dirty, but they are usually superbly fitted to life in the environment they were designed for. You can only choose to play a humanite if you choose the upbringings Plebeian or Stationary. If you play a humanite PC, your starting Reputation is halved – it’s 1 for Plebeians and 2 for Stationaries. In return however, you get a talent connected to your biosculpting. Read more about humanites in Chapter 10. You can create your own humanites using inspiration from the ones in the book.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Humanites</h4><ul><li><strong>SIRB</strong> get the talent Pheromones.</li><li><strong>XINGHUR</strong> get the talent Resistant.</li><li><strong>NERID</strong> get the talent Water Breathing</li></ul></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>PLAYING A SEMI-INTELLIGENCE?</h5><p>You could create a PC from one of the semi-intelligent species nekatra, ekilbri or skavara. Make sure that the other players are fine with it, and then have the GM check the rules for semi-intelligent species in Chapter 14.</p></div><h4>CHARACTER CONCEPT</h4><p>When your background has been decided upon, it is time to figure out what you have done in your life up to this point – your concept. The concept tells you what you do for a living. Each concept contains several sub-concepts to give your PC more detail. Your concept affects your attributes, which skills and talents you can choose from at the start of the game, your gear, your relationships and your personal problem. All of the concepts are described at the end of this chapter.</p><p><strong>Contacts</strong>: Your sub-concept determines what network of contacts you will have access to. If you’re in a place where the GM decides that you might find former colleagues, you can roll for Manipulation to find a useful contact.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Concepts and sub-concepts</div><ul><li><strong>ARTIST</strong> – Courtesan, Musician, Poet</li><li><strong>DATA SPIDER</strong> – Analyst, Correspondent, Data Djinn</li><li><strong>FUGITIVE</strong> – Criminal, Mystic, Revolutionary</li><li><strong>NEGOTIATOR</strong> – Agitator, Diplomat, Peddler</li><li><strong>OPERATIVE</strong> – Assassin, Guardsman/-woman, Spy</li><li><strong>PILOT</strong> – Driver, Fighter Pilot, Freighter Pilot</li><li><strong>TRAILBLAZER</strong> – Colonist, Prospector, Scout</li><li><strong>PREACHER</strong> – Ascetic, Missionary, Prophet</li><li><strong>SCIENTIST</strong> – Archaeologist, Medicurg, Technician</li><li><strong>SHIP WORKER</strong> – Deckhand, Dock Worker, Engineer</li><li><strong>SOLDIER</strong> – Legionnaire, Mercenary, Officer</li></ul><h4>NAME &amp; APPEARANCE</h4><p>When you know your concept, it is time to pick a name and decide how you look. Each concept has a list of suggested names, facial features and clothing – choose from the list or come up with something of your own. Note choices down on your character sheet. Name and appearance will not affect the game in any mechanical sense, but are of course important to bring your PC to life.</p><h4>REPUTATION</h4><p>Your Reputation is a rating that decides your social position and standing in the Horizon. Your Reputation is determined by your upbringing and modified by your concept. If you play a humanite, your Reputation is lowered (page 22 @JournalEntry[The Player Character]). Your Reputation can change over the course of the game (page 28). Your Reputation score determines how easily you can manipulate people (page 62 @JournalEntry[General Skills]), and how others generally treat you.</p><h4>ATTRIBUTES</h4><p>Your four attributes determine your basic composition, what natural characteristics you were born with. Attributes range from 1 to 5 for normal humans, and a higher number is better. The attribute scores are used when you roll dice for important actions in the game. When you create your PC, you get a pool of points to spend on your attributes – how many depends on your upbringing. You must assign at least 2 and at most 4 points to each attribute, with an exception of the key attribute for your concept, in which you can place 5 points.</p><ul><li><strong>STRENGTH</strong> – Raw, physical strength and physique.</li><li><strong>AGILITY</strong> – Your overall body control and motor skills.</li><li><strong>WITS</strong> – Intelligence, alertness and sharpness of mind.</li><li><strong>EMPATHY</strong> – Your charisma, empathy and ability to manipulate others.</li></ul><h4>HIT POINTS AND MIND POINTS</h4><p>Life in the Third Horizon will no doubt be tough on both your body and your mind – read more in Chapter 5. To measure how much trauma you can take, the game uses two numeric ratings: Hit Points (HP) and Mind Points (MP).</p><ul><li>You have a number of HP equal to your Strength + Agility scores. HP are degraded by damage.</li><li>You have a number of MP equal to your Wits + Empathy scores. MP are degraded by stress.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>As Sabah comes from a Stationary background, Jessica gets 14 points to spend on attributes. She gives Sabah Strength 2, Agility 3, Wits 5 and Empathy 4. She gets 5 Hit Points and 9 Mind Points.</em></p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch2/rollperson_soldat.webp\" /></div><h4>SKILLS</h4><p>The next step is picking skills. These are important, as they, along with your attributes, determine how effectively you can act in the game. There are 16 skills in the game, and they’re all described in detail in the next chapter. Your mastery of a certain skill is called your skill level and is a number from 0 to 5 – the higher, the better. Skills and their use are described in detail in Chapter 3.</p><p><strong>General and Advanced</strong>: The skills are divided into two groups: general and advanced. See the adjacent lists. Each skill is also connected to one of your attributes. You can always roll dice for a general skill even if your skill level is zero – just roll dice for the corresponding attribute. To use an advanced skill, you need at least a skill level of 1.</p><p><strong>Starting Levels</strong>: When you create your PC, you get a number of skill points to distribute across your skills – how many depends on your upbringing (see table 2.4). You can set your concept skills to a maximum of level 3, and other skills to a maximum of 1. You can increase your skill levels during play (see page 28 @JournalEntry[The Player Character]).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 2.3 SKILL LEVELS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>SKILL LEVEL</th><th>ABILITY</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Novice</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Capable</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Competent</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Experienced</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Master</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>GENERAL SKILLS</h5><ul><li><strong>DEXTERITY</strong> (Agility)</li><li><strong>FORCE</strong> (Strength)</li><li><strong>INFILTRATION</strong> (Agility)</li><li><strong>MANIPULATION</strong> (Empathy)</li><li><strong>MELEE COMBAT</strong> (Strength)</li><li><strong>OBSERVATION</strong> (Wits)</li><li><strong>RANGED COMBAT</strong> (Agility)</li><li><strong>SURVIVAL</strong> (Wits)</li></ul></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>ADVANCED SKILLS</h5><ul><li><strong>COMMAND</strong> (Empathy)</li><li><strong>CULTURE</strong> (Empathy)</li><li><strong>DATA DJINN</strong> (Wits)</li><li><strong>MEDICURGY</strong> (Wits)</li><li><strong>MYSTIC POWERS</strong> (Empathy)</li><li><strong>PILOT</strong> (Agility)</li><li><strong>SCIENCE</strong> (Wits)</li><li><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong> (Wits)</li></ul></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 2.3 SKILL LEVELS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>UPBRINGING</th><th>POINTS TO SPEND</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Plebeian</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Stationary</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Privileged</td><td>12</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Sabah, being Stationary, gives Jessica 10 points to spend on skills. She gives the Trailblazer Sabah Technology 3, Survival 2, Pilot 2, Dexterity 1, Ranged Combat 1, and Observation 1. Jessica picks the Nine Lives talent for Sabah.</em></p></div><h4>TALENTS</h4><p>Talents are tricks, cheats and abilities that give you an edge over others. They are more specialized than skills, and are a way to give further detail to your PC. Talents are described in Chapter 4.</p><p>You will have three talents at the start of the game – one each from your group concept, your character concept, and your Icon. You can acquire more talents during play. Mystical powers are a special category of talents – they are only available to a PC with at least skill level 1 in the Mystic Powers skill. If you begin play as a Mystic, you get to choose one free mystical power talent.</p><h4>YOUR ICON</h4><p>The nine Icons are ever-present in the Third Horizon. Almost all believe in their power, and the protection they offer from the Dark between the Stars. Prayers, giving alms and the burning of incense are common among most people at the start of a long journey, before signing a business contract or just to jump-start the old harvester in the shed.</p><p>You are born under the sign of one of the Icons. This Icon will have a tangible impact on your life, and might just lend you supernatural powers. You won’t get to choose your Icon – this is up to fate. If you have the Icon deck (sold separately), draw a card to see which Icon is yours – otherwise use table 2.5.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 2.5 YOUR ICON</h4><table><thead><tr><th>D66</th><th>ICON</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>11-14</td><td>The Lady of Tears</td></tr><tr><td>15-22</td><td>The Dancer</td></tr><tr><td>23-26</td><td>The Gambler</td></tr><tr><td>31-34</td><td>The Merchant</td></tr><tr><td>35-42</td><td>The Deckhand</td></tr><tr><td>43-46</td><td>The Traveler</td></tr><tr><td>51-54</td><td>The Messenger</td></tr><tr><td>55-62</td><td>The Judge</td></tr><tr><td>63-66</td><td>The Faceless</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ICON TALENTS</h5><p>The Icon under whose sign you are born will grant you a special Icon talent. Icon talents work like normal talents, but are generally more powerful. You can never learn additional Icon talents.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">The nine icons</div><p>The nine Icons worshipped in the Third Horizon are described briefly below, with their symbols in parentheses. Read more about the Icons in Chapter 10.</p><ul><li><strong>The Lady of Tears (a tear)</strong>: On their way towards the justice of the Judge, the dead are accompanied by the Lady of Tears. She also consoles the living. The Lady of Tears is a woman dressed in white, the color of mourning, with traces of tears still on her cheeks.</li><li><strong>The Dancer (a sweeping shawl)</strong>: The Dancer is the Icon of inspiration and perseverance. Sometimes a woman, sometimes a man, mostly androgynous. The Dancer represents the bond formed in the union between two lovers, but also unbridled lust when appearing as the Musician, playing a lyre or cirra.</li><li><strong>The Gambler (dice)</strong>: For the adventurous, the Gambler is a perfect fit. This Icon is often pictured as a little girl stretching her hand towards the beholder, her eyes urging you to take a risk, to roll the dice.</li><li><strong>The Merchant (a chalice)</strong>: The portly Merchant, an older man dressed in embroidered silk robes, is the Icon of growth, prosperity and success.</li><li><strong>The Deckhand (a key)</strong>: This Icon is usually portrayed as a tired boy holding a broom. The Deckhand can bless homes and ships, if they’re well-kept and the right offerings have been made.</li><li><strong>The Traveler (a ship)</strong>: For free traders, explorers and colonists, the Traveler offers protection. The Traveler is often portrayed as a man with his eyes on the horizon, holding a walking stick, a compass or an astrograph.</li><li><strong>The Messenger (a scroll)</strong>: The fleet-footed Messenger brings news, prayers and omens to wherever the faithful might be. The Messenger is portrayed as a pale boy with a stern face and flaming eyes.</li><li><strong>The Judge (a sword)</strong>: An old matriarch with a grave face and a sword at her side is the common way to picture the Judge. The Judge’s realm is that of justice and due punishment.</li><li><strong>The Faceless (no symbol)</strong>: The seeker among the Icons is never pictured. In temples and on Icon walls there is instead an empty place or alcove, or an asymmetry in the placement of the other Icons.</li></ul><h4>PERSONAL PROBLEM</h4><p>As a PC in Coriolis, you have a history. You have been through something before the beginning of the game that still haunts or threatens you – perhaps a mortal enemy, a dark secret or a strong addiction? Whatever it is, it’s called your personal problem. Each concept lists three suggested personal problems – choose one from the list or come up with one of your own. Your personal problem is mainly a tool for the GM to create stories and events that feel personal to you, but it also affects how many Experience Points you receive after a gaming session (page 28 @JournalEntry[The Player Character]).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Example</h4><p><em>Sabah is possessed by something from the Dark between the Stars. It sometimes takes over, causing seizures or memory loss.</em></p></div><h4>RELATIONSHIPS</h4><p>As you enter the game, you will already have relationships to the other PCs. These relationships will affect how you gain Experience Points (see below) and are useful tools for the GM to create suspense. When creating your PC, describe your relationship to each of the other PCs with a short sentence on your character sheet. Your concept lists a few suggestions to choose from, or to use as inspiration.</p><p><strong>PC Buddy</strong>: When you’ve chosen your relationships to the other PCs, you should pick one of them as your buddy – your best friend in the group. Check the box next to that person on your character sheet.</p><h4>CREW POSITION</h4><p>You’ve already chosen your spaceship – it is time to decide who does what onboard. There are five crew positions:</p><ul><li>Captain</li><li>Engineer</li><li>Pilot</li><li>Sensor Operator</li><li>Gunner</li></ul><p>Decide as a group who should have which position. The crew positions are mainly important during space combat, which you can read more about in Chapter 7. You are free to switch positions during play, so the choice is not permanent. The space combat chapter describes how to proceed if you have fewer than five PCs in the group. If you have more than five PCs, you can either share positions, or crew other stations onboard, like the medlab, the hangar etc..</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Crew Cards</h4><p>For each of the positions, there is a Crew Position Card supplied in the Icon Card Deck (sold separately), which includes a summary of the actions possible for each crew position. These cards are not needed for play, but are very handy.</p></div><h4>GEAR</h4><p>The last step in the PC creation process is for you to pick your starting gear. Your concept gives you a few choices. You can purchase extra gear during play (see the price lists for goods and services in Chapter 6).</p><p><strong>Starting Capital</strong>: The currency in the Third Horizon is called the birr. Your upbringing (see above) determines how many birr you start the game with, along with your starting gear. Transactions involving birr are mostly handled electronically, using so-called tags.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch2/Kapitel_1_rollpersonen.webp\" /></div><h4>ENCUMBRANCE</h4><p>Each of your possessions should be written down on a row under Gear on your character sheet. If an object is not on the list, you don’t have it anymore – you’ve dropped it or forgotten it somewhere. Generally, you can carry a number of items equal to your Strength doubled. Note down one object per row on your character sheet. Talents (Chapter 4) can increase your carrying capacity.</p><p><strong>Heavy and Light Objects</strong>: Extra heavy or cumbersome objects are harder to carry. An object deemed heavy will count double and thus take up two rows on your sheet instead of one. Some objects may even require three or more rows. There are also objects considered light – they require only half a row, meaning you can have two light items on one row.</p><p><strong>Tiny Objects</strong>: Even smaller objects than light ones are called tiny. They are small enough not to affect your encumbrance at all. A good rule of thumb is, if the item can be concealed in a closed fist, it is tiny. Tiny items must also be written down, even if they don’t weigh you down.</p><p><strong>Overencumbered</strong>: You can temporarily carry more than your normal load. If you do though, you must roll the Force skill each time you attempt to move any long distance. If you fail the roll you must either let go of what you are carrying, or stop where you are.</p><h4>IMPROVE YOUR CHARACTER</h4><p>Your PC will not stride unaffected through the Third Horizon. Your adventures will change you – this is the only certainty in an uncertain world. Your PC will improve her skills, learn new talents and change her Reputation score over the course of the game.</p><h4>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h4><p>How much you learn during the game is measured in Experience Points (XP). You get your XP after each session. Have a debriefing and let everyone discuss what happened. For each of these questions you can answer “yes” to, you get 1 XP:</p><ul><li>Did you participate in the session? You get 1 XP just for attendance.</li><li>Did you overcome a difficult challenge, to help your crew to reach its current goal?</li><li>Did you put yourself or your crew at risk because of your personal problem?</li><li>Did you learn something new about yourself or another PC?</li><li>Did you sacrifice or risk something for your PC buddy?</li><li>Did you act in accordance with your Icon?</li></ul><p>The GM will have the last say on how many XP each PC gets, but let everyone speak their mind. Mark your XP in the checkboxes on your character sheet. After XP have been handed out, you’re free to change relationships with the other PCs</p><h4>LEARNING SKILLS AND TALENTS</h4><p>When you’ve gathered 5 XP, you can take an advance. An advance is either increasing a skill level by 1, or learning a new talent. You can never raise a skill level above 5. You can learn any new talent, except for Icon talents. When you’ve taken your advance, erase 5 XP and start getting new ones. When you’ve got another 5 XP, you can take a new advance. You are free to save XP as long as you like, before using them.</p><h4>CHANGING YOUR REPUTATION</h4><p>Your Reputation in the Horizon can be changed by actions you take in the game. This is decided after the session, when XP are handed out. If you’ve done something generally considered good and heroic, your Reputation is increased by 1. If you’ve done something generally considered evil or destructive, your Reputation is decreased by 1. Your Reputation can never go below zero. Truly remarkable deeds may change your Reputation several steps. For an action to affect your Reputation, it must be publicly recognized somehow.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch2/nazareem_hemlighet_lang.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"DmRbiiOUl10MFwFV","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266762,"modifiedTime":1680592693614,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"z5IBYcYozlnsVh3c","sort":0,"_id":"oNnAw2JClobd8L7d"}

Some of them fell silent and were forgotten during the Long Night, but the Zenithian rebirth has opened them again, as the lifeblood of commerce is once again flowing in the Horizon. Below are descriptions of the most important routes and the problems and dangers that affect them.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch13/dabaran_landning.webp\" /></div><h4>THE ALGOL ROUTE</h4><p>Many free traders work the route to Algol as the systems along the way are relatively safe from corsairs, and have yet to be exploited by the factions. The portals are stable and the stations are well manned, up until one reaches Algol and the surrounding systems. After Nharmada, things are much more quiet, and only the most stubborn or desperate crews push on all the way to Eanu.</p><h4>THE DABARAN CIRCLE</h4><p>The busiest route in the Horizon goes from Mira via Kua to Dabaran. The bulk haulers prefer the shorter route across Uharu, but since the rebellion there is pretty much constant traffic and the portal stations are often under-staffed, and this way has become increasingly unsafe. The longer Amedo route past Algebar and Rigel is used primarily by free traders, but has also become dangerous since Almida, the corsair queen, has expanded her operations in Caph and Marfik.</p><h4>THE MIRAN CHAIN</h4><p>The Miran chain is not the most traveled route in the Horizon, but perhaps the most important. The shorter route across Aiwaz and Zalos used to be the safest choice, as the portals in the Odacon system are still unreliable from damage they suffered during the Portal Wars. After a bulk hauler going the long way round disappeared when jumping from Odacon, the Consortium forced the Order of the Pariah to open their portal stations again. The Order’s tangled bureaucracy still makes the jump across Zalos difficult – expensive customs fees and arbitrary restrictions often create a queue of ships waiting to jump to and from the system. Desperate free traders still prefer the Odacon route despite the dangers, as trade is good along the way in the Quadrant of the Pillar.</p><h4>THE SADAAL ROUTE</h4><p>The Sadaal route has the least amount of traffic of all the routes, probably because the largest hub along the way, Sadaal, only recently allowed off-world trade. Since the Consortium started factories on Sadaal, the whole route has come alive. The Sadaal portals are easy to use and the high frequency of Portal Builder finds in Ghodar, Daybul and Menkar attracts many explorers and archaeologists. Menkar is also home to the empty portal – a portal no one has returned from, said to connect to an unknown, Fourth Horizon.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>NAMING STANDARD</h5><p>A system is usually named after the largest planet it contains. To avoid confusion, one says for example ”in Dabaran” when referring to the system, and ”on Dabaran” when talking about the planet. Binary and trinary star systems always have their portals by the primary star. The other stars have names of their own, but are usually referred to as ”B” and ”C”. Reaching these stars is done by jumping to the primary star and continuing on – there are no known inter-system portals. Stasis is sometimes used within such a system, as the distances between the stars can be enormous.</p><p>The risk of encountering corsairs makes this unwise in some systems, instead forcing the crew to sit through long, boring and sometimes maddening voyages through empty darkness.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Yrrilv2ra1szNuAY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266827,"modifiedTime":1680376266827,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"oPLdZAmj7NWDIcSp"}

The faction is based on Coriolis, but has no seat on the Council, much to their chagrin.</h3><p><strong>The Syndicate</strong> was founded at the same time as Coriolis, and is viewed by many as the illegal shadow of the Consortium. The faction is made up of a group of wealthy families from the crew of the Zenith who joined forces with Firstcome criminal groups on Algol, Sadaal and Zalos. Together, they took control over the street gangs that had started to form on Coriolis.</p><p>The Syndicate wants their operations to run smoothly, and this requires a certain level of law and order. They cooperate with the Guard to combat petty crime because it disturbs their more lucrative forms of business: protection rackets, gambling, pimping, drugs and smuggling. In the first decades after its birth, the Syndicate grew to own almost the entire Guard through threats and bribery.</p><p>The courts and the governor needed a drastic change, and asked the Zenithian Hegemony for help. The Hegemony created the Judicators. This new tool of law enforcement decimated the Syndicate’s lower levels, especially the street gangs. Soon, however, the crime families learned to adapt, and balance returned once again. Today, the Judicators are less involved with the Syndicate and focus their resources on other forms of crime.</p><p>The basis of the Syndicate is the gangs that run the different plazas on Coriolis. Things get violent from time to time, as the gangs’ methods include a certain level of territorial disputes and revenge. Outside of the station, the middle layers of the organization, the so-called charpurs, run the operations. They operate above the gangs, organizing things like smuggling and drug production. The only areas the Syndicate stays away from are slave trading and the smuggling of faction tech. Unfortunately, other players are less scrupulous.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE BLACK SHIPS</h5><p>Recently, stories have begun to surface about oddly shaped ships that sensors can hardly detect, and that suddenly vanish in a burst of static. Some crews claim to have spotted the ships near the smuggling routes, most frequently around the moons of Transsurha in the Kua system.</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/Syndikatet_fraktion.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FRONT</h5><p>The Syndicate’s contact with the legitimate economy is handled by front men in the Consortium companies, bureaucrats on Sadaal, drug cartels on Algol and supposedly even the rebels on Zalos-B. These contacts are used for smuggling, drug production, proxy trips and illegal research – sometimes with human subjects. The Syndicate is not considered to possess any faction technology of its own, with the possible exception of the rumored “black ships”.</p><p>The biggest concern for the Syndicate today is the rumors going around that they have begun to associate with the Algolan slavers, which has led to a renewed interest from the Judicators. Both the Church of the Icons and Ahlam’s Temple have, unsuccessfully, tried to fight the Syndicate’s power.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CHALLENGERS</h5><p>The Syndicate is the largest criminal organization in the Horizon, but not the only one. There are three rising threats to their power in the Horizon: The Serpent, the Slavers and Ferekam, criminal groups dealing in slave trade and gun running.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 9.2 FAMILIES AND GANGS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>FAMILY</th><th>ORIGIN</th><th>GANG</th><th>TURF</th><th>DISTRINGUISHING MARKS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adibal</td><td>Sadaal</td><td>Faris</td><td>Mulukhad</td><td>Dresses in garish colors</td></tr><tr><td>Afyana</td><td>Algol</td><td>Ganiya</td><td>Spice Plaza</td><td>Secret handshake</td></tr><tr><td>Birbasil</td><td>Zenith</td><td>Lama</td><td>Ozone Plaza</td><td>Lips tattooed black</td></tr><tr><td>Intisaar</td><td>Zalos</td><td>Izza</td><td>Spring Plaza</td><td>Scarification on their backs</td></tr><tr><td>Rafa</td><td>Algol</td><td>Wark</td><td>Market Plaza</td><td>Secret handshake</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"utkkAV4DkOiILuMd","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266937,"modifiedTime":1680376266937,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"pdjS5g1RFCO35Fx5"}

The emerald green sphere of Kua shines at you from the other side of the glass dome in the ceiling, but despite the splendor around you, your attention is immediately drawn to your dinner companion at the table: a large, imposing woman on a divan, a silent, stern-looking warrior in full combat dress behind her – one of the judicators by the looks of it – and a beautiful, well-dressed hijra – probably a courtesan – on a cushion on the floor.</em></p><p>The people at the table are judge Kurahan, judicator Akouba Kosha, and Apion, the judge’s courtesan for the evening. After a short introduction, the PCs are offered hot towels by Apion to rub their faces, hands and feet with, after which the dinner can begin. Judicator Akouba remains standing throughout the dinner until a deal has been struck between the PCs and judge Kurahan.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> JUDGE KURAHAN’S MISSION</h5><p>The PCs are offered comfortable divans across the table from the judge. Apion rises in one perfectly choreographed motion and supplies the PCs with hot towels and rose water. They offer to take care of any heavy clothing, shoes, or other gear. Gentle but precise hands move softly across tired limbs and tense shoulders. The stress of the last few days seems to melt away in the blink of an eye. Judge Kurahan smiles at the PCs and waits for Apion to sit back down before she starts to speak.</p><p>The authoritative, obviously Zenithian, woman is friendly and well-mannered and seems to know a lot about the PCs, but not in an unsettling way. She makes it clear that she has chosen the group precisely for their background. As the GM, you should prepare her speech and take into account both the unique skills of the group and their actions during Act 1, as well as any previous scenarios you have played. When everyone is sitting down comfortably, the judge begins to speak:</p><ul><li><strong>The PCs</strong>: She knows a lot about them and can describe their backgrounds in detail.</li><li><strong>The Investigation</strong>: She knows about their investigation, even things that haven’t become public knowledge.</li><li><strong>The Conspiracy</strong>: The last segments have been plagued by kidnappings, murders, and rioting, and she suspects that this is all part of a single conspiracy. The Coriolis Guard have tried to do something about it, but failed. Judge Kurahan sees the disappearance of the Emissary as an escalation that could carry catastrophical consequences as the Cyclade celebrations are just about a week away. The festivities coincide with the one-year anniversary of when the Emissary at the Xene station declared itself to be the Judge incarnate. The first day of the new year is also the anniversary of when the so-called Messenger Emissary arrived at Coriolis, which makes the timing of its disappearance unlikely to be coincidental. Judge Kurahan believes that all these events are linked and asks the PCs to investigate them both effectively and discreetly.</li></ul><p>During the conversation, the judge tries to get as much information from the PCs as she can without them noticing it. She doesn’t share her motivations for launching a private investigation alongside the official one unless she is pressed about it and the PCs somehow find out about her mystic son. She concludes by saying:</p><ul><li>She is interested in speeding up the investigation into the disappearance of the Emissary as much as she can, officially because she is worried about the potential societal consequences – but unofficially because she worries about the safety of her son Arlain.</li><li>Through judicator Akouba, she has arranged access for the PCs to the Emissary’s residence.</li><li>Judicator Akouba can be of assistance if the PCs need any help from the station’s law enforcement.</li><li>The PCs are expected to report their findings to the judge via Akouba (they are given a pulse com set to reach the judicator).</li><li>The group is also given a direct link to the judge’s private communicator, but it is only to be used in emergencies.</li></ul><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>In this scene, it is important to establish judge Kurahan as a reliable patron and cooperating with her could prove extremely beneficial. The scene should also introduce the mysterious judicator Akouba Kosha, although no details about her are presented yet.</p><ul><li><strong>The Emissary</strong>: At the end of the scene, it should be clear to the PCs that going to the Emissary’s residence by Lake Abhrra is the next step in their investigation.</li></ul><h4>ALKAMAAR’S RESTAURANT</h4><p>Food and drink are integral parts of most cultures in the Third Horizon – most evidently displayed by the different elites who use certain forms of eating and drinking as a way to distance themselves from the common people and – even more so – each other. Whether it is a craving for flower extracts from the Monolith or a ravaging hunger for the Sadaalian lugal mollusk, one place in the Horizon has it all, a treat for every imaginable appetite – Alkamaar’s, at the top of the Spire. You can find a short description of Alkamaar’s at page 265 in the Coriolis Core Rulebook @JournalEntry[The Spire].</p><p>One’s first visit to Alkamaar’s is an unforgettable experience. Before entering the circular main room, spanning 120 meters in diameter, one has to wait in the foyer, surrounded by the restaurant’s legendary gallery of stone statues. The foyer is full of sensors and discreet guards who make sure that no weapons or other forbidden gear is brought into the main hall.</p><p>The first thing that strikes a visitor as she strides through the doorway with a courtesan on her arm, is the awe-inspiring, all-encompassing sinister beauty of the nothingness as it is revealed through the transparent dome above the restaurant. The walls lean inward and meld seamlessly with the ceiling to form an enormous window toward space, and contrasted by the darkness outside, the light in the faces of one’s friends, in the food and drink, and in the song, the dance, and the laughter seems to burn that much brighter. When the visitor is reclining comfortably on the divan she has been shown to, waiters approach to describe tonight’s menu as they offer her a refreshing bowl of rose water to wash her hands in. After that, the hours rush by at the speed of light, the evening leaving the visitor profoundly moved – and wanting more.</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Handout #2: The Judge’s Invitation</h4><p>@JournalEntry[The Judge's Invitation]</p><p>I look forward to discussing our common concerns tonight at Alkamaar’s.

Each skill lists examples of what a failure, a limited success and a critical success could mean – but the exact details are up to the GM. The combat skills melee combat and ranged combat are exceptions to this – the effects of your level of success when testing these are detailed in Chapter 5.</p><h4>DEXTERITY (AGILITY)</h4><p>When you jump, climb, sprint, or perform an action that demands speed or coordination, you test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong>.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You fall or stumble and fail to reach your goal. Depending on the circumstances, you run a high risk of taking damage. See page 97 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat] in Chapter 5 for rules about damage resulting from falling.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You manage to pull off the maneuver, but just barely.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You succeed with flawless skill, and you achieve some unexpected, positive side effect, like helping a friend or creating an obstacle for an enemy. The GM decides the details.</p><h4>FORCE (STRENGTH)</h4><p>When you must lift something heavy, carry a wounded comrade or force shut an airlock by hand in a spaceship under explosive decompression, you test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong>. If you are trying to overpower another person, for example when arm wrestling, it is an opposed roll.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You give it your all, but you are not strong enough. Is there another way?</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You beat the challenge, but just barely.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You beat the challenge, and receive some unexpected, positive side effect – for example wounding an enemy, helping a friend or finding a new way ahead.</p><h4>INFILTRATION (AGILITY)</h4><p>Avoiding confrontation by sneaking around the enemy is often the wiser choice. Test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> when you want to move unnoticed, perform a sneak attack, or set up an ambush (see Chapter 5). <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> tests are opposed rolls with your <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> score against the observation score of your opponent.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>The enemy spots you or hears you. The element of surprise is lost.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You avoid detection, but are forced to take a detour to your destination. An enemy might also sense that something is up and start looking for you.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>Like a shadow in the night you approach your oblivious enemies. You get a +2 on a sneak attack if you perform it directly after the <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">infiltration</strong> test.</p><h4>MANIPULATE (EMPATHY)</h4><p>Lies, persuasion, threats, charm or seduction – there are many ways to make someone see things your way. You must beat the opponent in an opposed <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong> vs <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong> roll (see above). Your Leverage (below) and your Reputation modify the roll.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>Your opponent refuses to listen and won’t accept your demands. She may even attack you if you provoke her.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>Your opponent must make a choice – either do as you want, or attack you physically right now (with <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> or <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong>). Even if she agrees, she can demand something of you in return – the GM decides what. You can either accept the deal or back off.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>Your opponent is so moved by the strength of your personality that she accepts your demands without asking for anything in return. If you want to, you can also inflict stress points (page 92 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) equal to the number of sixes you rolled.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">LEVERAGE</div><p>When testing MANIPULATION, you get a +1 for each of the following factors:</p><ul><li>You have more people on your side than your opponent does.</li><li>What you are asking for doesn’t really cost your opponent anything.</li><li>Your opponent is injured.</li><li>You have helped your opponent in the past.</li><li>You present a strong case (GM’s judgement).</li></ul><p>You get a -1 for each of the following factors:</p><ul><li>Your opponent has more people on her side than you do.</li><li>What you are asking for is expensive or risky for your opponent.</li><li>Your opponent has nothing to gain from helping you.</li><li>You and your opponent have trouble understanding each other.</li><li>The distance between you and your opponent is Short or longer (page 84 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>REPUTATION</h5><p>Your Reputation score and that of your opponent will affect your MANIPULATION roll. If yours is higher, you get a +1 for each step you outrank your opponent. If your score is lower, you instead get a -1 for each step of difference. Reputation will, however, only affect your roll in situations where your social standing in the Third Horizon is relevant. The GM has the final call on this.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>MANIPULATING GROUPS</h4><p>When you use <strong>MANIPULATION</strong> on a group of people, you normally engage with the group’s leader or spokesperson. Remember that you get a -1 for being outnumbered by your opponent. If you reach an agreement with the leader, the group will usually accept this. If there is no clear leader, things will be harder – every one of your opponents will then act individually.</p></div><h4>MELEE COMBAT (STRENGTH)</h4><p>The Third Horizon is a violent place. At times you will have no choice but to fight for your life. Test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> when either attacking someone or defending yourself in close combat. Rules and details are found under <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">melee combat</strong> in Chapter 5.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: You can use weapons in close combat – anything from simple shivs and blunt instruments to advanced weapons like Dura knives and Mercurium swords. Weapons will give you a bonus and inflict more damage than an unarmed attack. Read more in Chapter 5.</p><h4>OBSERVATION (WITS)</h4><p>An adventurer in the Third Horizon must always be vigilant, or she won’t live long. You test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> to spot someone sneaking up on you (opposed roll, see above). You can also test the skill when you spot someone or something at a distance if you wish to know more.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You can’t make out what it is, or come to a faulty conclusion. The GM gives you false information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You can see what it is, but can’t tell much detail. The GM gives you correct but brief information.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You see in detail what it is, and also discover a weakness (if enemy/obstacle) or a new route ahead.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>DON’T ROLL TO SPOT HIDDEN OBJECTS</h4><p>In Coriolis, you don’t roll dice to find hidden objects, secret doors or clues. If you describe to the GM that you are searching in the correct spot, he should let you find it, if it can be found at all. Roll no dice.</p></div><h4>RANGED COMBAT (AGILITY)</h4><p>With a Vulcan pistol, an accelerator carbine or a common throwing knife, you can stop an enemy at a distance, keeping the bloodstains off your caftan. Test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> when firing a ranged weapon at an enemy. Read more about <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> in Chapter 5. <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong> is also tested when operating ship guns or launching torpedoes. Read more on this is in Chapter 7.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Firearms counts as gear, giving you a bonus to your roll, just like weapons in close combat. The difference is that a firearm is a direct necessity to even use the skill. Many different firearms are described in Chapter 5.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch3/spejare.webp\" /></div><h4>SURVIVAL (WITS)</h4><p>Surviving in the harsh landscapes of the Third Horizon is not easy. The Horizon contains everything from steaming jungles and frozen tundras, to titanic mountains and bottomless oceans. <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">survival</strong> includes the knowledge about constructing shelters, finding food and water, and how to orientate oneself using only the stars in the sky, as well as how to construct simple traps, how to fish and how to hunt. Test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">survival</strong> when you travel in uncharted terrain on a planet’s surface.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FAILURE</h5><p>You get lost, or are unable to find food or clean water.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LIMITED SUCCESS</h5><p>You find your way, find clean water, find food, or create a simple shelter for yourself.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> CRITICAL SUCCESS</h5><p>You find a shortcut to your destination, find clean water and food for yourself plus D6 others, or construct a sturdy shelter that can be used again later.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch3/algol_tanzim.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"6xFn0NSHptDD9CpF","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265867,"modifiedTime":1680592700556,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"kEBvNyzmJEcxPti6","sort":0,"_id":"qjFLVTQORjnX1GTw"}
{"name":"Culture in the Third Horizon","flags":{"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true},"coriolis-corerules":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/10 - The People of the Horizon","noteRef":""},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-corerules.journalentry.22a69f858b89b669"}},"pages":[{"name":"Culture in the Third Horizon","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>The Icons and nothing else are what keep the Horizon together, at least according to the old Firstcome proverbs, followed by culture and family. Yesef Megnolim, the famous agitator, summed it up well when he said “The Icons first, family second, and games for the people”. The different systems share some cultural references, but what counts as good or popular differs from system to system, or even from faction to faction. The blood operas are appreciated almost exclusively in the Zenithian Hegemony, while conservative factions such as the Order hold chant choirs in high regard.</p><h4>MUSIC AND SONG</h4><p>The cirra is a string instrument played all over the Horizon, its bright notes elevating baria ballads as well as Algolan round dance. Apart from the cirra, the Horizon contains a myriad of instruments with local variations beyond counting, from wooden flutes on Mira and Algol to mechanical music machines on Dabaran. The nine-string Charou lyre is a legendary instrument mastered almost only by Ahlam’s courtesans, who can bestow both ecstasy and torment on the listener. There are two major styles of singing: the baria, melancholy and portentous, and the kabbah, which is more dance oriented and backed by computer organs. The kabbah is all the rage in the clubs in the Core of Coriolis and in the dars of Dabaran where popular musicians such as the Gouri Brothers, the Cirras of Dartarlides and Hala-hal perform it. The stars of the baria include Honna Ibrim, Aicha, and modern legend Sani Sowal. A more obscure song style is the prophet songs popular on and around Mira and Zalos – six bar stanzas about the words of the Icons, visions of the future or passages from the holy scriptures. A Zalosian version of the prophet songs are the chant choirs, although they often end in revels of flagellation. The blood operas of the Zenithian Hegemony are the complete opposite – extravagant compositions with huge orchestras, elevating Zenithian order and reason over the Icons.</p><h4>LITERATURE AND STORYTELLING</h4><p>Storytelling is just as strong a tradition as singing in the Horizon. The champions of the craft are often the tarrab, people similar to traveling poets or bards. Literature is also popular and reading is considered a noble pursuit, a sign that one has time to spare. The privileged make sure to always keep books around their homes, and some even have special reading rooms, or balconies with special light reflecting fields around them. The very rich employ courtesans or readers to perform the stories for them. On Coriolis, the well-off often get together to “kawah read”, meaning that they listen to a storyteller while enjoying kawah, chai, dates, and sweet fruit. The most famous writer in the Horizon is without a doubt the secretive Mazelman, allegedly living somewhere in the Rimward Reach to research his next book. His earlier works The Siren’s Call, The Nightingale, and Stories From a Lost Age are must-reads among the upper classes. The so-called tag stories are very popular among the plebeians and the poor. They are short, adventurous stories, often about brave heroes and captains who defy evil factionaries, bureaucrats or the rich. The series about Captain Imsalima of the Lotus Leaf is a best seller, and comprises about twenty parts to date with many shadow writers working on the project.</p><h4>HOLO, PROXY AND PICTORIAL MEDIA</h4><p>The technology used to spread news across the Horizon is also used by the entertainment industry. The Bulletin is a market leader here as well, through their Seven Stars studio, and people everywhere follow their popular holo dramas The Plantation Owner’s Daughter, Guesthouse Brahima, and the comedy show The Avant-Kuarde, centered on the mischief and escapades of the students living in the Mulukhad district. Other players also produce and market holo films – the Iconocrats on Sadaal and a few Algolan trade houses for example – but they are rarely up to Bulletin standards. The theater is very popular throughout the Horizon, from the street corner puppet shows on Algol to the acrobatic Miran theater. The proxy media has spread to the public thanks to the Syndicate’s illegal erotic proxy trips, but more and more proxy novellas are beginning to circulate. They are often of impressive quality, which hints at a big corp or faction sponsored production.</p><h4>HOLIDAYS AND CELEBRATIONS</h4><p>Most holidays in the Third Horizon are of a religious nature and celebrate the glory of the Icons in one way or another. Since the founding of Coriolis and the Church of the Icon’s Declaration of the Sacred Rites, the dominant Icon holidays have spread to almost the entire Horizon. Local traditions are still upheld of course, such as the Elephant festival on Algol and the Day of Flowers on Mira. The three big holidays in the Horizon are the Cyclade, the Founding, and the Pilgrimaria. The Cyclade takes place on the last day of the current year or cycle. Big parties are organized and resolutions for the future are made. Many choose to enter their life bonds on this day, or sign important trade agreements. To be born during the Cyclade is considered a sign of good fortune in life. The Founding is a day the faithful spend in prayer, praising friends and benefactors but also passing judgment on liars and traitors. Feuds between families, clans, or business competitors should be settled on this day. After sundown, processions carrying statues of the Judge and the Gambler parade through the cities, villages, and stations. The faithful end the day in quiet reflection.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>MIRAN ACROBATICS</h5><p>For as long as anyone can remember, acrobatics, dancing, and martial arts have been a part of Miran culture. The flying theaters – acrobatic performances traditionally using advanced systems of ropes and pulleys – tell the stories of King Macaque, Sah Mahib, the Dancer’s incarnate, and many other often-humorous adventures. The theaters use grav belts instead of ropes nowadays and this has propelled the art form to new aesthetic heights. The scene where the Dancer comes flying across the stage in a red kharonicle with flowing veils in “Jasmine Mourning” has been described as magical by theater critics, and it gave Nestera, who manufactures the grav belts, massive publicity on</p></div><p>The Pilgrimaria is the proper day to start one’s pilgrimage. For those who have already completed theirs, or who are unable to travel, the day is devoted to remembering the dead. In recent years, the Algolan tradition to sculpt skulls out of fruit, sugar, or colored clay has spread to the rest of the Horizon and what used to be a very solemn celebration is now more festive. Dancers with skulls painted on their bodies dance in the Core to the sounds and flashes of firecrackers. Big fireworks shows are common in planetside cities.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/mira_lihdra.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Ia5g5JYVJ2XV2ybG","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265719,"modifiedTime":1680376265719,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"qknttXgEck6cK9YW"}

The route between the portals and both the planet Kua and Coriolis pass by Jina, but few ships ever stop here. The planet’s industry is not big enough to attract traders or transports. There are no spaceships permanently stationed in the settlement of Aram’s Ravine either. The Colonial Agency keeps a few ground vehicles, but nothing that can leave the planet. To contact the outside world, the inhabitants have to rely on free traders or other ships which come to the planet to visit the Cala Duriha, a luxury space station on Jina’s moon.</h3><p><strong>Jina has few</strong> qualities that make it worth a visit and many qualities that make you want to avoid it – acidified wastelands, frozen poles, and pounding heat over eroded highlands and dried up oceans. There is water below the planet’s surface and a few lakes and rivers just north and south of the equator. The poisonous air means that primarily only fungi, bacteria, and a few species of lichen can live here. There is some limited insect life underground and in deep crevices, of which the sturdiest example is a butterfly that in its larval form is well adapted to the climate, but dies shortly after transforming. Apart from the colony Aram’s Ravine, intelligent life on the planet is limited to a few tribes of odd acid-resistant barbarians. They could possibly be humanites, but this has not been thoroughly researched. Evidence against the humanite theory includes the fact that no traces of early Firstcome ruins that could have belonged to their masters have been found on Jina, which is common in other places with a humanite population.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/jina_ny.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>FACTS ABOUT JINA</h4><ul><li><strong>DIAMETER</strong>: 6,790 km (roughly 50% that of Kua)</li><li><strong>EQUATORIAL CIRCUMFERENCE</strong>: 21,321 km (roughly 50% that of Kua)</li><li><strong>SURFACE AREA</strong>: 145 million square kilometers (roughly 28% that of Kua)</li><li><strong>GRAVITY</strong>: 0.37 standard gravity</li><li><strong>DAY LENGTH</strong>: 20 hours</li></ul></div><h4>ARAM’S RAVINE</h4><p>Aram’s Ravine is the only colony on Jina, located near the Lamka plateau north of the equator, where a natural body of water is present. The colony is the hub for everyone working the claims along the plateau’s fault line or the salt pits in the Desera delta. Aram’s Ravine started out as just one of the hundreds of prospecting endeavors that the Colonial Agency started in the Kua system. Like the majority of those projects, Aram’s Ravine turned out to be a disappointment – the bauxite findings were bigger on other planets and Jina’s toxic air made even small-scale mining expensive. The colonists that remained in Aram’s did so against their better judgment, clinging to a desperate hope that the place would somehow deliver what they had been promised.</p><p>The ravine is steadily growing, and the rapid erosion has turned the colony into a pillar city full of columns formed of layers of tougher rock upon which the remaining buildings sit. Many houses have been lost over the years, having slid off the pillars and into the darkness below. Some people live down in the actual ravine itself, the bulk of them miners, but rumors say that some among these slummers seem remarkably unharmed by the acidic atmosphere, something attributed to supposed dealings with the wild barbarians that live on the other side of the plateau. The ravine dwellers are growing in numbers, mainly because the ore and salt mining operations work their people until they break, after which the unlucky survivors have nowhere else to go but down below. “Sooner or later, you’ll end up in the ravine” as the saying goes, which is doubly true as the ravine also functions as the colony’s only burial site.</p><h4>ACID STORMS</h4><p>The acid storms that appear so colorful and majestic from the halls of the Cala Duriha are a lethal threat down on the planet’s surface. They are caused by unique weather phenomena that concentrate the acids in the air to dangerous levels. In extreme cases, the acidity can be so strong that it immediately causes chemical burns to unprotected skin. An unfiltered breath during one such storm could be fatal, as the sensitivity of the membranes in the lungs is much higher than that of the skin. How the storms are created is poorly understood. Hand-cranked sirens in Aram’s Ravine warn the inhabitants of the coming danger and the streets are quickly empty, even though everybody knows that very few storms are dangerous enough to wound or kill someone in protective gear. People outside of Aram’s are warned by crackling messages over the Agency’s communicators. When the warning comes, one should quickly take cover underground, inside vehicles or in survival tents.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>CALA DURIHA</h4><p>The moon Cala Duriha has blossomed thanks to its strategic location and the fact that Coriolis and the Council have become key players in the politics of the Horizon. The station’s wide domes and panoramic windows make it look like a water lily on the surface of the moon, with its heart burrowed deep inside the rock-like roots. The station started out as a dirty mining colony, and exactly how it has been able to transform itself into a luxury resort is debated both in the free trader cantinas out in the Rimward Reach and in the halls of power on Coriolis.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"sb9B8hIkGuC6zKa7","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265985,"modifiedTime":1680376265985,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"qwVQlBYIFDxTi7eI"}

The Core is also open and airy in comparison to the tight, crowded spaces of the rest of the station. The Core Plaza is located in the heart of the station, open all the way up to the lower levels of the Spire.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/kärnan_inuti_coriolis.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">The  Core</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE LAW OF THE LEGION</h5><p>Easy access to bio sculptors, prosthetisists, tattoo artists, and guns makes the Ozone Plaza and the nearby stretch of the Promenade attract Legionnaires like moths to a flame. Legion-affiliated bars usually feature skulls or bones in their names or on their signs. The three most infamous watering holes are Mokbaran’s, Igal’s, and the Cranium Bar, the latter also serving as the unofficial headquarters of the faction and the place one should seek out to join the ranks of the Legionnaires. Many other mercenary agencies can be found in close proximity to these three places. The heavy Legion presence makes the Ozone Plaza a relatively safe place. The so-called “Bone Law”, based on military laws and punishment, is enforced in the plaza. The Legion makes sure the peace is kept, and the Coriolis Guard never patrols here. Legally, the Bone Law actually only applies to members of the Legion, and contains some pretty archaic practices, such as the right to trial by combat, and public whipping as punishment. The harshest punishment in the Bone Law is the “promenade”, in which the guilty party is simply thrown out of an airlock, but it has never been carried out on Coriolis.</p></div><h4>THE CORE PLAZA</h4><p>The Core Plaza lies at the very center of Coriolis. It is dominated by a large building that contains many of the station’s administrative functions and a series of vertilanes and grav shafts that connect the Core to the Spire. The smaller businesses on the Core Plaza are cantinas, taverns, cafés, and courtesan houses, and the clientele is mainly bureaucrats and merchants. What empty space there is on the plaza is not covered with market stalls as in the other plazas, but kept clear for the slow-moving clutter of bodies on their way to or from work. There are many tailors and haberdasheries in the streets around the plaza. This is where to go for the latest fashion, even for members of the upper classes in the Spire, although the very rich deal only with the tailors that do house calls. The most famous haberdasheries here are Fermahat &amp; Sons, Yisimi’s fabrics, and the Pasha’s Flying Palace, which is the most expensive of them all, offering house calls at an extra fee. Many courier agencies also have their offices by the Core Plaza; both the Bulletin’s own Ermes and private firms like Kifri’s Courier Bureau can be found here.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.6 ENCOUNTERS ON THE CORE PLAZA</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.6 Encounters on the Core Plaza]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Dashani</td><td>Courtesan</td><td>Graceful</td><td>On a walk</td><td>Siblings</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Mweki</td><td>Diplomat</td><td>Golden</td><td>Going somewhere</td><td>Lust</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Aaryan</td><td>Bureaucrat</td><td>Sweaty</td><td>Is panicking</td><td>Lost tag</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Parishad</td><td>Speculator</td><td>Fiddles with hair</td><td>Reading</td><td>A better tomorrow</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Jahanara</td><td>Courier</td><td>Wiry</td><td>On a delivery</td><td>Family</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Markudh</td><td>Merchant</td><td>Tanned</td><td>Haggling</td><td>Wealth</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>MULUKHAD</h4><p>Coriolis’ entertainment district is called the Mulukhad – a potpourri of shady alleys and old buildings housing restaurants, cantinas, bars, and gambling dens. The Mulukhad has everything a thrill seeking resident or visitor could possibly desire. Gambling is clearly the dominant vice, taking place in bars, gambling dens, and in the big Stadium located just next to the district. Restaurants that stand out are the Al-Qadr with its all-red interior and the Mudejar, a classier establishment for refined – and expensive – excitement.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE MULUKHAD HORROR</h5><p>There is an abandoned block in the Mulukhad. Legend has it that it all started when a boy in one of the families who lived there became possessed by something from the Dark between the Stars, an evil efrite or maybe a dybbuk. The family of the boy tried to get help from preachers and prophets but nothing worked. One day, the whole family was gone and the module they had lived in was drenched in blood. The story was spread around the neighborhood and the other families moved out of the house. More mysterious things happened after that – food and drink spoiling, children suffering from strange diseases – and eventually the whole block was deserted. Residents of the surrounding houses leave offerings to the Icons by the entrance to the block, and no one dares to linger in the nearby alleys come evening.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE STADIUM</h5><p>The oval Stadium rises above the Mulukhad almost all the way up to the arced beams of the skeleton of the Core. The Stadium offers every type of zero-G entertainment there is: holographic obstacle courses, thermal duels, graviton ball, scooter racing, Algolan kickball, and much more. There is one main event every night during the evening watch, usually with professional contestants and intense betting. In the hangars underneath the Stadium, visitors can try out the different activities for themselves. There are a few restaurants and bars in the Stadium as well, Talah having the best reputation with its beautiful glass balconies above the scooter track.</p><p>More savage forms of entertainment are also offered at the Stadium in the form of modulation or gladiator matches. The violence is often very artistic, but still nothing for the squeamish. The crowds favorite is duels between nekatra and other wild beasts: dirhad, wildlings, azuks and other rare creatures. Humans are not allowed to fight under the same circumstances as beasts, only through modulation. Exceptions used to be made for Dabaran slave warriors pitted against the beasts, but this is not the case anymore. Slavery has also been officially banned on Dabaran.</p><h4>THE AMPHITHEATER</h4><p>The artists on Coriolis who don’t live and work in the Ring can be found in the district around the Amphitheater. The open, bowl-shaped theater is based on a Dabaran original and is partly made from yellow Algolan sandstone. Both modern art forms such as holo art, modulator sculptures, and proxy music and eternal classics such as dance, theater, mime, storytelling, and classical music are performed on the stage of the Amphi. The diva Chemara Kour is the artistic director and makes sure the ticket prices are kept reasonable. There are private boxes available for those with some extra birr to spend. The largest events are usually concerts with famous performers like Sani Sowal, The Lotus Flutes, or the dance troop Feather Steps.</p><h4>THE LITTLE HORIZON</h4><p>The Little Horizon blocks are located along one of the Core’s outer walls and are home to all new arrivals on the station, from all corners of the Horizon. The street vendors here offer exotic delicacies such as candied hysia bugs, moon fruit, or salted florineys. The architecture is also varied and foreign with Algolan pagodas and round nomad huts crammed in between angular Sadaalian houses and Miran balconies. The Little Horizon is home to the smuggling organization the Serpent, and the Syndicate gangs now and then attempt to claim the area, which often results in street fighting.</p><h4>THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CORIOLIS GUARD AND THE JUDICATORS</h4><p>The headquarters of the Coriolis Guard is located in a pillar that is the center beam of the frame of the station. This is not the only office of the Guard, but it is the largest, with its administration, garages, grav elevators that run through the whole Core, and their arsenal of a few light police vehicles. The offices of the Judicators are also located here, behind thick armor-plated walls and equipped with security gates since the gang war of CC 59. The front of the judicators’ section of the building is more imposing than that of the Guard’s, in polished marble rather than scratched hyper plastic.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>GUARD DRONES</h5><p>The latest addition to the Guards’ arsenal is three sensor drones on loan from the Palatena lab owned by the Foundation. They are really a sort of modified sensor buoy of the same model as those used in spaceship countermeasure dispensers, but with remote control via djinn units and holo glasses. They are armed with both Vulcan and stun weapons, and, according to rumors, the new and experimental vomit fields developed by the Foundation. The people of Coriolis hate the drones bitterly and the machines are often met with volleys of rotten fruit or garbage when they are out on patrol.</p></div><h4>THE BULLETIN COMPLEX</h4><p>A brand new complex close to the outer wall of the Core serves as headquarters for the Bulletin. The beautiful facade of the building is in old Miran bas-reliefs depicting famous reporters, courier vessels and the faction’s spherical portal probes, easy to recognize by their four antennas. The complex contains several broadcast studios, newsrooms, offices, make-up rooms, holo effect chambers, and everything else necessary for the making of a Bulletin show. The wing facing the Core is where you will find the infobase, the hub that connects all the terminals on the station to the infonet. The public is not allowed inside the complex other than as studio audience for a select few shows such as the Wheel of Fatima or News at Dawn.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>POPULAR BULLETIN SHOWS</h4><ul><li><strong>THE BULLETIN SHOW</strong> – The biggest morning and evening show, led by dawn hostess Nana Eliades.</li><li><strong>THE WHEEL OF FATIMA</strong> – A game show where contestants spin a prize wheel to win fancy prices such as an evening at Alkamarr’s or luxury cruises in the Hamura system.</li><li><strong>NEWS AT DAWN</strong> – A news show that reports on the latest happenings in the Kua system as well as the rest of the Horizon.</li><li><strong>STREET JUDGE</strong> – Holo show about the judicator Amon Hasra solving crimes on Coriolis. Best episode: “Chrysanthemum Red”.</li><li><strong>THE PLANTATION OWNER’S DAUGHTER</strong> – Drama about love and intrigue on a Kuan plantation. Best episode: “Under the Baobab”.</li><li><strong>STUDIO ZHANA</strong> – A news show with investigative reporters digging for scandals and injustice, mainly in the Kua system.</li><li><strong>THE VOICE OF THE ICONS</strong> – The Church’s own Icon show and debate program, hosted by the preacher Alima Souroz.</li></ul></div><h4>THE DOME OF THE ICONS</h4><p>The Dome of the Icons prides itself on being the largest temple in the Horizon, even if the veracity of this has been questioned. The Dome has a front made of glass from Akhandar sand from the volcanic beaches of Antmira and it is surely a breath-taking sight, stretching one hundred meters into the air. The dome itself is a towering sixty meters high, also made of glass, anchored in the twice-as-high central tower with thick steel cables. From the chamber at the top of the tower, the preachers lead the faithful in prayer between the watches. The Dome is always lit by huge spotlights in a representation of the Icons’ light in the dark night, and is the only exception in the otherwise perpetual semi-dusk of the Core. The open dome covers an exquisite mosaic floor where the actual shrine is located, a humble nine-sided temple in burned clay, only a few meters high, just below the central tower. The temple is covered in inscriptions and symbols, some hinting at an Iconic connection. A little to the side of the temple sits a small well called the Well of Tears, a quiet place of refuge for people in grief or bereavement. The tiled floor of the well is covered with talismans, handkerchiefs, hairpins, jewelry, and other offerings.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/03.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">The Dome of the Icons</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE CLAY TEMPLE FROM GHOASA</h5><p>The Clay Temple from Ghoasa is one of the Church of the Icons’ most important relics, found on Antmira during the bloodiest months of the Portal Wars. The preacher Adhar Bakuh was a member of the expedition that found the temple and was the one who realized its importance and value. He had a local humanite clan transport the temple to the Icon City where it was left until CC 48 when it was transported to Coriolis. Through generous donations, the Church of the Icons could buy a whole block in the Core, where they had famous artists design and build the mosaic square and the dome above the temple. Because of a mishap during the transportation and reconstruction of the temple, the inscribed text on the temple walls is no longer readable. The Foundation has asked the Church several times for permission to create a replica of the original temple to decipher the text but has been denied every time.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PREACHERS AND PROPHETS</h5><p>The temple grounds are full of preachers, prophets, and priests, but only five of them, including the faction’s local herat Wasimah Umm, has access to the temple itself, and only at morning and evening prayers and holiday mass. All other holy activity such as prayer, meditation, sacrifice, and the like takes place in the mosaic square under the dome, usually on one’s personal prayer rug or on a reed rug loaned from one of the novices. Many novices and priests wish to serve at the Dome on Coriolis as the story of “the Uplifted One” says that true believers can ascend directly to the Icons from the temple grounds.</p><h4>THE FOUNDATION’S INFOTHECA</h4><p>The black, glass front of the Infotheca is the bastion of the unbelievers on Coriolis. The halls inside cannot be accessed without sanctioned business in the building, and contain every possible form of data storage – from holograms, modulates, and proxy to Miran books bound in human skin, papyrus from Dabaran, magnetic memory cubes of meteorite iron from the frozen wastes of Odacon, and much, much more. One can gaze down at all this from the high galleries at the top of the building through volcano-proof sapphire glass, and elite Legionnaries and secret security systems developed by the Foundation guard the whole complex.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE MUSEUM OF HISTORY</h5><p>One of the wings of the Infotheca houses the Foundation’s museum of the Horizon’s modern – post-Portal Wars – history. The relics gathered here are divided into three categories: Primitive Era, Arrival, and New Era. The “Primitive Era” exhibition contains things such as scrap armors from the Sarma barbarians, an almost full suit of skin from an Uharan shaman – tattooed from head to toe with the ancient wisdom of a dying people – and a sizeable collection of long rifles and other primitive weapons. Visitors to the “Arrival” exhibition will see a detailed modulate of the Zenith’s transformation into Coriolis and the Net, and many other examples of Zenithian technological supremacy. The “New Era” shows pictures from all over the Horizon, but with a focus on Consortium-sponsored projects on the core worlds. The restricted sections of the museum are said to hold great riches such as a broken death clock from Hamura, a mummified Miran family, and taxidermied specimens of curious beasts and darkmorphs of unknown origin. Several failed burglary attempts have taken place here, since the museum’s security level is the same as the Infotheca’s.</p><h4>THE STUDENT DISTRICT</h4><p>If you are looking for wild parties and daring japes, the Student district is the place to go. The district is jammed in between the academies of the factions and the gambling dens of the Mulukhad, and its tiny apartments make even the living modules of the Ring feel spacious. Peace and quiet are non-existent concepts as the student parties here run around the clock in rolling waves of intoxication, music and laughter. The taverns Wurud’s and Azad’s are good places to visit if you need a reasonably priced place to recover from the nightlife. The roofside Quadim restaurant with its view of the Mulukhad is somewhat more expensive, but in return, they keep the noisier students away.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>SCHOOLS ON CORIOLIS</h4><ul><li>The Free League’s General College</li><li>The Legion’s War Academy</li><li>The Samaritan Medical Academy</li><li>The Foundation’s Biomedicurgical Institute</li><li>The Judicators’ Forensics Institute</li><li>Ahlam’s Courtesan Academy</li><li>The Bulletin’s Lyceum of Propaganda</li><li>The Colonial Agency’s School of Higher Education</li><li>The Consortium School of Economics</li><li>The Legion’s Cadet School</li><li>The Foundation’s College of Engineers</li></ul></div><h4>THE UNIVERSITY DISTRICT</h4><p>The massive university district contains all the faction-run schools and academies, the Bulletin’s gigantic Infotheca, and the rampant decadence of the Student district. The district has one of the larger tube stations on Coriolis – The Academy – where students crowd with ordinary people coming into the Core from the Spice Plaza located just a spoke away. The larger academies have their own student housing, usually in the form of long rows of modest buildings with many floors of student halls. A few parks are scattered across the university district.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/Kärnan_coriolis.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\">The tube station The Academy</p><p></p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.7 ENCOUNTERS IN THE UNIVERSITY DISTRICT</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.7 Encounters in the University District]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Jiwanna</td><td>Student</td><td>Dances sitting down</td><td>Studying</td><td>Party</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sarfan</td><td>Teacher</td><td>Absent-minded</td><td>Hurrying to class</td><td>Knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Moahala</td><td>Graduate student</td><td>Sweet tooth</td><td>On a snack break</td><td>To achieve</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Sammi</td><td>Day laborer</td><td>Smokes arrash</td><td>Relaxing</td><td>Taking it easy</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Trehore</td><td>Activist</td><td>Stubborn</td><td>Chanting</td><td>Change</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Feryaab</td><td>Professor</td><td>Portly</td><td>Reading</td><td>Power</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE MISSING STUDENTS</h5><p>Every year, students go missing from the universities and academies. Most of them either drop out, find new lives or seek their happiness somewhere else in the Horizon. Some families go looking for their lost ones, but this is the exception. When the elderly waba Corriha one day strolled past the little grove between her block and University Park, she spotted a hand sticking out of the ground. The Guard and eventually the Judicators were called to the scene. When the grove was dug out, the bodies of two missing students were found – both murdered, but the Judicators won’t say how. The nightlife is suddenly much quieter in the Student district. Everyone is scared and whispers to one another: Is there a killer among us?</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GARBAL’S CURIOSITIES</h5><p>In a small, anonymous square off one of the winding streets that zigzag away from the center of the Core, you just might stumble across the tiny antiques shop Garbal’s Curiosities. It is almost hidden behind a café where elderly men and women slurp sweet kawah, only advertised by a tiny brass sign. The shop looks much bigger on the inside and is a veritable maze of shelves, corridors and staircases full of old books, manuscripts, unreadable tags, strange art, mounted animals from all over the Horizon and the proprietor’s two huge collections of light globes and healing scarabs. Garbal is an expert on Horizon history and known in the academies and among the station’s would-be historians. Questions about rare artifacts or art are sometimes directed here.</p><h4>THE GARDEN OF SEEKERS</h4><p>The Garden of Seekers is an odd collection of many different miniature landscapes in a space smaller than one hectare. In the middle of the garden sits the Seeker cult’s strange temple, constructed in a weird blend of all the garden’s architectural styles. The landscapes of the garden are from all across the Horizon: a Dabaran oasis sits next to some steaming Kuan jungle, and a spindly marsh delta from Bahram on Sadaal shares a corner with a dry, Zalosian forest. Several places in the garden are built like small canyons, with rope bridges across seemingly bottomless ravines. There are small benches and tables for visitors to rest at scattered across the garden. All the Horizon’s flowers can be smelled here, from poppy to jasmine. The noise from the Core is softened by the lush greenery and mixed with the gentle babble of small brooks, giving the garden an almost meditative aura. The streets around the garden are far from safe however – the Guard, the gangs, and other violent types usually lie in wait for their victims here or in the surrounding blocks. Some shifty dealings take place inside the garden as well – spies and professional snitches often lurk about the shadowy green</p><h4>THE SAMARITAN SANATORIUM</h4><p>Just opposite the Infotheca’s black front lies the conglomerate of blocks and buildings that have melded together into the Samaritan Sanatorium. Inside the front gates, you come to a hallway where you are supposed to state your business before you are allowed to continue. The vast courtyard of the complex is a wonderland of flowing, green hills and mosaic paths of blue and white – a place of rest and refuge. Visitors to the Sanatorium usually remark that even the air smells better here.</p><p>Elevated walkways and balconies stretching high up into the air of the Core circle the courtyard. Patients, relatives, Samaritans, and even pets mingle on the balconies that are full of laundry lines, tables and patios – not unlike the alleys of the Ring. The Samaritans live in a row of low, whitewashed houses made from Kuan clay that also function as wards and chapels in honor of the Martyr. Stairs from the courtyard lead to the open wards above as well as to the rooms for treatment and storage that exist in the deep cellar of the sanatorium – an underbelly of unknown depths.</p><p>Anyone is welcome at the Samaritan Sanatorium, regardless of status or wealth, but it is mainly poor people who are patients here as the privileged employ private physicians. There are of course exceptions – rich people afflicted with grave and disgraceful illnesses that have lost them their social status or family support are often forced to visit the Samaritans as a last resort.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"amFtyna5m3DjxucB","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3,"6Di8yMnm3jtdNeRI":2},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.3.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266444,"modifiedTime":1684524686571,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"wz390mVwR1sEKuel","sort":0,"_id":"r2PppdD42TPpVXaO"}

Elmeda’s society can be found close to the middle neck of the central shaft.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>Queen Elmeda is the leader for a group of slummers and exiled artists who live in a make-shift village in one of the larger halls at the heart of the Cellar. The location is ideally chosen, close to the central shaft. The village is called The Third Sphere, and lives off of salvaging as well as plundering from smugglers, other slummers, and skavara. When the PCs arrive, they will be taken before the queen either by residents of the village or by a nekatra from Elmeda’s bodyguard. Let the PCs' arrival coincide with the afternoon ”market” (see The Third Sphere below).<br />The Slummer Queen is the key to the deepest parts of the Cellar and staying on her good side is necessary to continue the descent. The arrival of the PCs is well timed for Elmeda as several conflicts in the village are nearing the boiling point and she could use some help:</p><ul><li>A slummer in her inner circle, Danthë Farrah – who also happens to be her mistress – is conspiring to take over the leadership of the village and launch an exodus upwards. You should let Danthë be off on a mission when the PCs arrive, but the group can sense the tension at the court if they mingle with the residents.</li><li>Awl the skavara has a bigger market and threatens to steal the slummers away from Elmeda.</li><li>Frax, a nekatra in the queen’s guard, is not as loyal as Elmeda thinks and is making plans for the future.</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/elmeda_full.webp\" /></div><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs should leave the queen’s court with at least the following information:</p><ul><li>Elmeda can describe how to find the martyr strike team’s base.</li><li>Awl is the queen’s nemesis.</li><li>The strike team’s base is located beyond the Slum Cemetery and the part of the middle Cellar known as the Labyrinth.</li><li>The Labyrinth is guarded by a terrible monster that devours anyone who isn’t careful.</li></ul><p>The main piece of information is of course the description of how to pass through the Labyrinth to find the secret base. They can acquire this info by trading with one of the influential players in the village or by gaining access to Elmeda’s map.</p><ul><li>Awl or Goba can describe the way to the strike team’s base.</li><li>Awl can tell them of gaps in the sensor grid around the base.</li></ul><h4>THE THIRD SPHERE</h4><p>The ceiling in the hall is almost as high as on some of the floors in the Spire, but lacks the holo screens of its civilized counterpart – the ceiling here is black, and the glittering rivetheads form squares rather than star constellations. Cables with multi-colored lights criss-cross the room, supported by pillars rising like trees among the tents that cover the floor – tents made from cardboard, old blankets, plastic trash, and old dura plates. Marketplace noises can be heard from the center of the village. This is the home queen Elmeda – The Third Sphere.<br />The Third Sphere is the name of the halls ruled by Slummer Queen Elmeda – or by her cult, depending on how one sees it. The main hall is wide, with high ceilings, but without any original lighting left. The people of the village have arranged what illumination exists themselves, using whatever they can find: lamps, lanterns, light strips – all in different colors. The Third Sphere is both secluded and strategically convenient, located just above the second neck in the central shaft. The only way inside is through one of four security doors that have been restored to working condition (can only be opened using technology) by the gravely alcoholic former ship mechanic Danthë Farrah, counselor ,and on-again, off-again mistress of the queen. The location of the queen’s court makes it a junction for all traffic and smuggling between the upper and lower Cellar:</p><ul><li>One door leads to the central shaft.</li><li>One door leads to the semi-functional elevator (see The Free Falling Elevator above).</li><li>The third door leads to the Skavara market and the Slum Cemetery.</li><li>The last door is guarded, hidden behind Elmeda’s throne, and only those who have carried out a mission for the queen are allowed through. It leads directly to the Labyrinth, without passing the central shaft and the Slum Cemetery.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>RUMORS</h4><p>In The Third Sphere, the PCs can find the following rumors (some true, some not):</p><ul><li>The Slum Cemetery is the place where the slummers of old buried their dead.</li><li>At the heart of the Cellar lives a terrible ”beast” that devours both bodies and souls.</li><li>Smugglers use the Labyrinth for storing and transporting contraband.</li><li>A mad prophet wanders the Labyrinth. His prophecies always come true.</li><li>The skavara have a whole village in the Cellar where they grow crops in the light from the central reactor.</li><li>With the guidance of “The Savior” the people of The Third Sphere are about to march down into the darkness to seek a new life, without hardship and sickness.</li><li>Danthë has contacts within the the council of factions, and has promised that soon The Third Sphere will be recognized and its people shall rise from the abyss and take their rightful place in the Spire.</li></ul></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE COURT</h5><p>The queen’s residence consists of four tent pavilions. At some point, they were probably colorful and beautiful, but years of tabak, arrash, and opor smoke have turned them yellow, and countless tears in the fabric have been fixed with copper wire harvested from around the Cellar. The queen’s four tents are at the center of the village, and the surrounding tents are in much worse condition, built primarily from odds and ends scavenged in the surroundings. Elmeda’s subjects are mostly humans, but descendants of the Tehl humanites – incredibly strong unskilled laborers brought in from Errai when Coriolis was first constructed and then forgotten about when their services were no longer needed.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE VILLAGE</h5><p>The Third Sphere is made up of around two hundred people, a quarter of which are children. Four individuals stick out – Elmeda’s four bodyguard nekatra, escapees from the gladiator matches in the Mulukhad. All residents in The Third Sphere are malnourished, bordering on starving, and many suffer from crippling injuries and disabilities caused by their living conditions. Children and the elderly are the worst off as the queen has decreed that food is primarily reserved for those able to work. The survival of the village is dependent on long and dangerous scavenging trips through the Cellar.</p><p>The people living here are proud of their village however. Even if the name alludes to the vulnerable state of the colony, both geographically and socially, its residents view themselves as a natural part of the station in the same way as residents in the Core or the Spire do.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>The most important NPC in this scene is the Slummer Queen. The other NPCs described are her bionic cobra, the nekatra guard, and a typical villager.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Elmeda dol-Parnasso]</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/elmeda_full.webp\" /></div><ul><li>@Actor[Kahnara]</li><li>@Actor[Frax]</li><li>@Actor[Goba the Lame]</li><li>@Actor[Awl]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>Suggestion for events in The Third Sphere.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AUDIENCE WITH THE QUEEN</h5><p>The PCs reach the village and Elmeda’s court via one of the security doors. After climbing down through the central shaft or surviving the falling elevator, they finally find the hidden settlement. It is surrounded by lights in many colors, and the walls are fancifully decorated (testing culture can reveal that the art celebrates Zenithians, primarily hegemonistic ideals).<br />Knocking on the door will eventually lead to two slummers opening it. They are wiry but muscular women with pale, chapped skin, and their hair in tight, oiled knots. Both are armed with makeshift spears made from duralite plates and pipes. Their tone is stern, but the PCs are welcomed to The Third Sphere and the domains of queen Elmeda. What is their business here? Do they have something to trade with, or have they come to offer their services and loyalty to the queen?<br />The PCs are instructed to hand over their weapons. If they obey, or instead manage to threaten the guards, they are then taken through the colorful hall, down a few steps and shown to Elmeda’s tents. More armed slummers show up along the way, blocking the PCs' way back to the door as they are presented to the queen. She is wearing perfect makeup and her presence exudes cruelty and power. The audience takes place in her tent with her nekatra guard present, plus a few unwashed servants and Kahnara, her bionic cobra.<br />During the audience, the PCs will come to know the following:</p><ul><li>Elmeda claims to know everything about the Cellar and its roads, smugglers, and lunatics.</li><li>She knows the Labyrinth and the Slum Cemetery, and about the mad poet Bathos.</li><li>She confirms that a group of smugglers have transported sedated people downward through the Cellar (Goba the Lame has handled the details).</li><li>She knows where these smugglers have their base.</li><li>She can share the location with the PCs for something in return.</li></ul><p>Elmeda is not interested in birr, jewelry, or guns in return for giving up he location of the martyr strike team’s base. She wants the PCs to do her a favor: kill Awl the skavara, whom she describes as a feral beast, more nekatra than skavara. Awl can be found in the Skavara Market and Elmeda can provide the group with a guide to find their way, such as Frax the nekatra (see NPCs above).</p><ul><li>The Guide: The real reason for offering the PCs a guide is that the queen needs eyes and ears at the scene to see if they actually carry out her bidding. She suspects that Awl may try to persuade the PCs otherwise.</li><li>The Nekatra Guide: If Frax is sent along with the group, chances are good that the PCs might sway the loyalties of the bitter nekatra.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE QUEEN’S REWARD</h5><p>If the PCs make a deal with Elmeda, she will wait for confirmation of Awl’s death before helping them. If the PCs proved to be extra reliable, she will also tell them that the smugglers recently installed security systems in the corridors around the base (see the The Martyr’s Embrace scene below). Possible rewards for the murder of Awl include:</p><ul><li>Knowledge of the exit behind Elmeda’s throne, leading down straight into the Labyrinth.</li><li>Elmeda’s map showing the way through the Labyrinth, all the way down to the strike team’s secret base.</li><li>A locket with the dol-Parnasso seal (gives a +2 to manipulation against Algolan servants and Zenithians in the Monolith).</li><li>Frax as nekatra escort.</li><li>Information about the strike team’s security systems.</li><li>A holy talisman to ward of the Beast in the Labyrinth (gives a +2 to INFILTRATION when hiding from the Beast)<br />Awl is described in the The Skavara Market event below. As the GM, you could also choose to alter the target of the PCs' mission – they could be asked to kill Frax, or perhaps Goba (Elmeda knows that he has made a deal with the martyr warriors behind her back). Regardless of who they are sent to kill, their target will turn out to be far from the ”wicked beast” described by Elmeda and, on top of that, also capable of showing them the way through the Labyrinth.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/slummer_queens_map.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  REJECTING THE QUEEN’S OFFER</h5><p>If the PCs refuse to carry out Elmeda’s mission, she won’t tell them how to find the smuggler base and the audience ends. She chooses to keep their confiscated weapons and if they ask for them back, they will be removed from the village at knife-point. If the PCs linger too long in the village, the nekatra guard will come and take them to one of the three doors. They won’t be let back in and will have to find their way further down on their own. You could let the events in the Through the Labyrinth scene give the group clues as to where they can find the martyr warriors.<br />By spending 3 DP, you could have the queen’s slummer guards attack the PCs and throw their unconscious bodies into the Labyrinth as food for the Beast if they lose.</p><p>Cost: 0, 3 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE QUEEN’S MARKET</h5><p>The open area in front of the Queen’s pavilions act as the marketplace in The Third Sphere. Merchants and slummers gather each afternoon in what for outsiders may look like a pathetic parody of the markets held up in the Ring and at the Core. The slummers who have found or stolen something not worth keeping for themselves, or not already confiscated “for the glory of the third sphere,” place their wares on damp blankets, lined up along the cold metal floor. Eatable food is practically unheard of, and mostly the “goods” offered are random spare parts, trinkets and cigarette butts. Sometimes decent, or even fancy clothes can be on offer, taken from a murdered or diseased slummer colleague. A small group of artists, who’ve for some reason or other joined The Third Sphere, show off and sell their creations, most often built out of the scarce materials found here in the station’s belly – cables, metal debris, or packaging materials.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SKAVARA MARKET</h5><p>An old hangar near the hull contains a market where skavara and slummers meet and trade scavenged objects. It is close to The Third Sphere, above the Labyrinth. The following text can be used when describing the market:</p><p>Below the steps, you hear growls, yaps and whining – a group of skavara by the sound of it. The open hall, supported by duralite beams thick as shuttles, contains a group of tents reminding a learned traveler of the nomad camps on Amedo. Blankets, sheets of cardboard, and plastic bags are spread out everywhere, covered with junk. Skavara scuttlet back and forth between the market and the tents, and a few slummers can also be seen.<br />A meaningful conversation with a skavara requires a culture test. This scene can be used when the PCs need somewhere to rest, when they have gotten lost, or if they have accepted Elmeda’s mission to kill Awl. You could decide that the market contains something of value, stuff left behind by the Guard or the Syndicate during an expedition: half-empty cells or Vulcan clips, M-doses, bandages, or tools. Such things may not always be of use to slummers and could be traded away.<br />Awl will quickly notice the PCs' arrival, and will try to talk with them, trade with them, and perhaps even try to join them, trading passage upwards for loyal service. Awl can offer them much valuable information – depending on how well the PCs negotiate with her (manipulation), she will share more or less of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Trade</strong>: She has things to trade: 1 T-dose, 1 Vulcan clip, and a gyro driver (tool that gives a +1 technology).</li><li><strong>Guide</strong>: She knows the Cellar inside and out and can give the group various skill bonuses and make sure they don’t get lost. She has also stolen a small sensor from the strike team’s base (which looks like a glass orb) and can show them the way.</li><li><strong>Scout</strong>: She can keep a lookout and warn them of hostile slummers (such as in the Slummer Attack event) and knows how to scare them off (she demonstrates with a few bites and snarls).</li><li><strong>The Medallion</strong>: She can sell them a small medallion with the Foundation’s symbol – a stylized galaxy – on it, stolen from a warrior who has been at the martyr warriors' camp down on Kua.</li><li><strong>The Sensors</strong>: She knows about the security systems around the strike team’s base and can describe how to find them, as well as point out where the blindspots in the system are – two of the “eyes” are missing (she closes one eye to explain what she means).</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/zombie.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"hB2A8rYwJFdAIV8A","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296623,"modifiedTime":1682695296623,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"quWuXIuT6GpidPe2","sort":0,"_id":"rHTjJrXCk0gN2plp"}
{"name":"The Net","flags":{"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true},"coriolis-corerules":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/11 - Coriolis","noteRef":""},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-corerules.journalentry.da15c04d6bb2bf2e"}},"pages":[{"name":"The Net","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>The Net follows Coriolis like a shadow. Its spindly and seemingly fragile construction is actually the Zenith’s old skeleton, nowadays supporting commerce rather than an actual ship. From afar, the Net appears as a strange jumble of light and dark shapes against the starlight. A steady stream of spaceships come and goes, and as one comes closer, the enormity of the Net becomes clear. The old “ribs” of the Zenith, metal beams several kilometers long, act as an outer perimeter, but during the 50-odd cycles since the completion of Coriolis, the Net has been rebuilt, expanding, and breaking down in different sections at the same time, which makes the borders of it all far from clear. At the intersection of the beams are hubs of docks, loading ports, and service stations. Heavy freighters bearing the logo of the Consortium rest against the beams while their precious cargo is redistributed onto smaller vessels to be taken down to Kua. Banged up free trader ships glitter like tiny pearls in the dark as the welders mend the damages from their last trip. Stevedores in exos move across the ships and the beams in a never-ending dance.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch11/hamn2.webp\" /></div><h4>THE PILOTS OF THE NET</h4><p>To most people, the Net looks like a wild and unpredictable mess of tons of metal and explosive fuel, a disaster of epic proportions just waiting to happen. This is true, and such a disaster would surely have happened already if it weren’t for the pilots who work the Net. Pilotage is an invaluable cog in the gears of commerce, and working the Net means working at the very heart of trade. The pilots have their own guild independent from any external interference. Their code calls for them to always act impartially, and their priority is always to make sure everything runs smoothly and effectively. This is how it works in theory at least, but not always in reality, although the guild is very quick to suspend members who take bribes that favor one company’s traffic over others. This stern practice means that you will find plenty of ex-pilots in the shadier bars of the station, drowning their sorrows after losing what is actually one of the best-paid jobs a common worker can get.</p><h4>BARIS KHAN AND THE SHADOW TRADE</h4><p>The Net is no place for business, and no money changes hands here. Everything is settled beforehand, and the Net is only a place of logistics and service. Loading and unloading, repairs and modifications – those are the activities of the Net. It is a place of workers, not of merchants in fancy dress or arrogant captains. Hard work and a sense of duty are valued here, not wealth or clan.</p><p>This, at least, is the image spread by Baris Khan, head pilot and COO of the Net. Khan is a stern but just leader. He cannot be bought and is absolutely impartial with all the factions in the Horizon. He does have an adventurous side to him however, which he lets out by allowing shady free traders and others who desire anonymity for their business to use the Net as a meeting point. No one can of course stop one captain from sending a courier over to another ship while on the Net, but Khan takes it one step further by offering empty docks as rendezvous points for negotiations, social gatherings and sometimes even duels.</p><p>He never charges anyone for these extra services, instead being content as long as he gets to hear the story of how the meeting turned out afterwards. He operates through intermediaries, but this is actually not necessary as all the factions who use the Net also have need of such informal meetings from time to time. After Coriolis, the Net is the most important station in the Kua system. Without its efficiency, commerce in the Horizon would be significantly hampered. All the factions are very aware of this and there is a careful status quo on the Net just like on Coriolis. Even if the pilots’ guild is a powerful force here, they have never had to demonstrate their full potential as all the players who rely on the Net make sure both that their own affairs are in order and that their competitors won’t cause trouble.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>KHILARA 4</h5><p>The Net has many hubs. One of the smaller ones is Khilara 4, an annex for unloading and redistribution of goods from the sector of the Dancer on the Net. The person in charge is Gulzar, a Dabaran, who tries to keep the hub running with slim economic means of doing so. There are two service platforms that rotate around Khilara 4 in eccentric orbits, Ara 1 and Ara 2. Although Gulzar is the official boss, the supervisor Zobotka is really the person the stevedores and technicians look up to and treat as their leader. Zobotka is a member of the Free League and is a tough negotiator on behalf of the rights of her workers. Khilara 4 has a bad reputation and people say that the workers of the hub add to their meager salaries by dealing in contraband, either for transport to other systems or to Kua and Coriolis. Baris Khan has not sanctioned this, and if it is true, there will be consequences.</p></div><h4>HOTEL HANG-SHAWA</h4><p>The Hang-Shawa hotel is a block of living modules for low income earners on the Net. Via elevators and shuttles, most areas are within easy access of the hotel. The hotel is known for harboring several traveling peddlers who sell proxy tags. The hotel is in terrible condition and is run by slumlords assisted by the Kush mercenary group. The guests pay a small fee to rent a so-called coffin – a small, enclosed unit with a bed that extends from the wall, shelves, and enough space for one or two people, but it is well known that the coffins sometimes house whole families.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE SHUTTLES</h4><p>From the spaceports of Coriolis, several shuttles per day depart for the Net, the Monolith and the larger districts of the Conglomerate. The Popular Assembly and the Hegemony, who both wish to see blossoming trade between the station and the planet below, subsidize passenger tickets.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 11.10 ENCOUNTERS ON THE NET</h4><p>@RollTable[Table 11.10 Encounters on the Net]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>NAME</th><th>PROFESSION</th><th>CHARACTERISTICS</th><th>ACTIVITY</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Fumarra</td><td>Stevedore</td><td>Mocks everyone</td><td>On a break</td><td>Having fun</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Mouffat</td><td>Pilot</td><td>Grumpy, mumbles</td><td>Preparing for the next job</td><td>Getting a ship</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Lamsirala</td><td>Deckhand</td><td>Inquisitive</td><td>Looking for work</td><td>Adventure</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Yrseh</td><td>Pilot on a bender</td><td>Unwashed</td><td>Drinking</td><td>Revenge</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Bouwoq</td><td>Smuggler</td><td>Mean stare</td><td>Loading cargo</td><td>Birr</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Aeleni</td><td>Captain</td><td>Tall</td><td>Making repairs</td><td>The crew</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"rZVA8xCSLsMQlTOr","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3,"6Di8yMnm3jtdNeRI":2},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.3.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266677,"modifiedTime":1684524699074,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"wz390mVwR1sEKuel","sort":0,"_id":"rzgUUQR7z8gTk9y6"}

After leaving the Sul-Mahala, the PCs head for the Foundation’s Hospital for the Treatment and Study of Hyper Sickness, a place very much associated with the terrible flooding that laid the valley in ruins. The PCs must now confront the strike team’s Priot and find Nabi-mu-Qad, the lost Emissary.</p><h4>The Situation</h4><p>The group have finally arrived at their journey’s end. In the ruined hospital, they find the final pieces of information dealing with the kidnappings on Coriolis, they find the Emissary’s dead body and they confront the remaining martyr warriors. The final stretch of their trek takes them through another swamp. Lights in the distance lead their way toward the hospital. The leader of the strike team, Priot Chabaun, has been corrupted by the darkness that lives in the swamp, and when the PCs arrive, they find that the warriors go about their wicked work with a fanatic fervor. They torture and interrogate their mystic prisoners to figure out who they might break and manipulate to use as bait to catch other mystics. Prisoners who refuse to be broken are tortured to death. The strike team has recently changed direction, as Priot Chabaun has begun interpreting the holy scriptures much more literally. He believes that the final battle between darkness and light is close at hand, and has therefore increased the pace of the operation considerably. The PCs must somehow infiltrate or attack the strike team’s base, while staying clear of the traps and alarms set up around the area. If they make it inside, they meet the remaining strike team members and the Astûrban’s secret agent, the false prophet Gaddar-e-Abrar. Gaddar had been inserted into the strike team to fan the flames of their righteous wrath, and the Priot listened willingly – until the agents from the First Horizon arrived and used powerful dream powers to enslave him.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MARTYR’S SERAFS</h5><p>Under the leadership of executor Keziah-Ven, three of the stunningly beautiful imperial Vestals made their way to the Kua system when the news broke of the Emissary’s disappearance. They approached the martyr strike team purporting to be the Martyr’s Serafs, angels sent to aid the righteous in their struggle against evil, and proceeded to interrogate the Emissary to find out the location of its siblings scattered across the Horizon (see @JournalEntry[00 - Introduction - Epilogue], page 188). They employed torture and darkness powers, which eventually killed the Emissary. With their missions completed, the Vestals boarded their ship, White Butterfly, and left Kua.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FALSE PROPHET</h5><p>Although the strike team members have lost their way during their stay in the corrupted marshes, secret agent Gaddar-e-Abrar views his Astûrban mission as a success; the Emissary has been captured and the Order of the Pariah appear to be the guilty parties to a public living in fear and uncertainty. In all, the shah board is set up perfectly for a strong and unified force to appear and give the people a banner to flock to. When the vestals arrived however, Gaddar realized that the game had changed into something that neither he, the Astûrban, or the hegemonists had predicted, and he stopped preaching to the warriors. He hopes to keep his cover intact until he can return to the Monolith and spends his time in the temple in the northeast wing of the hospital.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE PALADIN</h5><p>Priot Chabaun Kheml supervises the operation, both planetside and on Coriolis. In the last few segments, he has often turned to prophet Gaddar-e-Abrar for guidance, but after the plans to kidnap the Emissary moved into their final phase, a new voice has been growing stronger inside him. In dreams and visions, the Martyr has spoken to him through divine messengers dressed in shining white, naming him the purest one, the chosen one. Through Chabaun, the Vestals infiltrated and took over the strike team. Since his recent exaltation, Chabaun has begun to grow suspicious of Gaddar-e-Abrar’s wisdom.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The PCs find the last pieces of information about the martyr strike team’s operation, but they will likely leave the scene with only a limited understanding of the underlying levels of the conspiracy. A final clue about the Emissary’s origins can be found in the last scene, The Messenger’s Whisper.</p><ul><li><strong>The Emissary</strong>: The body of the mythical Emissary appears perfectly ordinary at first sight – a middle-aged woman with traditional Miran tattoos. She has been horribly tortured and her body is a lifeless husk, stiff and bruised. The eyes and mouth have been reduced to blackened holes. Contrary to first impressions however, the Emissary’s body was far from ordinary – the martyr warriors were unable to torture it as the wounds healed faster than they could inflict them.</li><li><strong>The White Butterfly</strong>: When the Serafs arrived, the warriors rejoiced. In the name of the Martyr, they were finally able to torture and eventually kill the Emissary (see the The Messenger’s Whisper scene below) The Serafs’ dark powers have left traces however – a tear in reality through which the dark between the stars can enter the Third Horizon in the shape of a bestial avenger.</li><li><strong>The Metal Bars</strong>: In the strike team’s base, the PCs find chests full of neodym bars – the rare metal used to pay Artyr Ghôlam and the other smugglers. The chests are branded with a logo; “Asteroid Exports”.</li><li><strong>An Unknown Enemy</strong>: If the airstrike is called in, or if Akouba Kosha is exposed as a traitor at some point during the scenario, the PCs will probably figure out that someone else is involved in the operation other than the Order. If the judicator’s cover remains intact, the PCs will still spot advanced weapons and faction tech at the strike team’s base and might get suspicious anyway.</li></ul><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>NO LOOSE ENDS</h4><p>Agent Gaddar is waiting for the right time to call for extraction from his Monolith masters, but since the Vestals’ visit, the Priot has been on alert and makes sure that someone is always watching the prophet. This is not Gaddar’s biggest problem however: unbeknownst to him, he has become a liability and a target for the Astûrban. If Akouba Kosha has accompanied the PCs all the way to the hospital, her orders include silencing him.</p><p>If Gaddar manages to send a message to the Astûrban, they respond by calling in an airstrike on his position. They have no intentions of extracting their agent, instead aiming to take him out while at the same time neutralizing the martyr strike team to make sure they hold all the cards when the day comes to present evidence against the Order to the Council. Black torpedo drones, painted with symbols from the Order’s holy scriptures are sent to the Sultra. Just as the PCs have secured the area and are about to call for backup, the drones strike (see the Death From Above event on page 179 @JournalEntry[03 - A Great Winged Shadow]).</p></div><h4>THE FOUNDATION’S HOSPITAL FOR THE TREATMENT AND STUDY OF HYPER SICKNESS</h4><p>An important hub on Kua in ages past, the Sultra was constructed by Firstcome colonists over many centuries, but it wasn’t until the Consortium’s construction of the enormous Cataract 27 that the valley’s potential truly blossomed. The golden age began during the office of mayor Tristan Dayal in CC 41, a man whose ambitions saw the Sultra grow into one of the area’s most lucrative districts. Conservation projects soon exposed ancient technology and artifacts from the earliest settlers, and excavations in Old Town gave the Sidonna family and the Foundation increasing power in the valley. Tristan was succeeded by Dahil Sidonna as governor and many new research institutes were founded, as well as a state-of-the-art explorator center. The construction of the Foundation’s Hospital for the Treatment and Study of Hyper Sickness in CC 50 marked the beginning of the end for the Sultra valley’s golden age.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HOSPITAL RUIN</h5><p>The hospital was constructed on one of the Sultra’s factory islands. Specialized research wings, gardens, and residential modules surrounded a hill upon which the main hospital complex was located. From the southern courtyard, two ornate marble stairs took visitors up to a terrace and the entrance to the enormous admission hall. North of the main building, a walled recreational area was constructed to give the patients a serene and shielded place to enjoy the long, hot Kuan evenings. The basement, currently underwater, contains a huge, three-story complex dedicated to the research of hyper sickness, mind memes, and the effects of portal jumping on the human psyche. The wings on either side of the main building contained patient and examination rooms. The most severe cases were kept isolated in a bunker separate from the main hospital.</p><ul><li><strong>Neodym Bars</strong>: There are three sturdy chests of neodym in the base. Two of the chests are half full and worth about 8,000 birr each. The are bulky and heavy, and require either a grav loader to move, or two people passing a demanding (–1) force test each. One is located in the temple and one in Chabaun’s chambers. The third, empty chest can be found in the admission hall.</li></ul>@JournalEntry[The Hospital Ruins Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE TEMPLE</h5><p>In the old hospital chapel, Chabaun and Gaddar-e-Abrar have set up a Martyr temple, complete with whips, haircaftans, and cilices. The temple reeks of death, swamp fever, and nightmares. The pillars in the room have long slices of human skin nailed to them – some dry, others still wet with fresh blood. A Martyr statue towers with pride of place in the back of the room. Below the statue, a parchment containing Urahuk’s Statutes is on display. The text is in old Zalosian which requires a successful culture test to read. The parchment looks to be at least a century old. medicurgy reveals that the text is written on human skin rather than paper. PCs who manage to decipher the text recognize the stanzas as those spoken by brother Ramas after his meeting with Noor during In the Wake of the Martyr:</p><p><em>”There will come a time when mankind turns to darkness once more</em><br /><em>When the unworthy speak without tongues</em><br /><em>When sister betrays sister</em><br /><em>When the light of peace nourishes the servants of darkness</em><br /><em>When brother kills brother</em><br /><em>Only they who live in the darkness will see the light”</em></p><p>The temple also contains twenty-something sugar globes and one of the chests of neodym bars. The logo on the chest says “Asteroid Exports” in Kuan.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LIVING QUARTERS</h5><p>Two rooms in the east wing have been sparsely furnished with washbowls, cots on the floor, and a few boxes of food and water. Chabaun’s room looks no different, except for a small Martyr statuette on a wooden stool in the middle. On a stained prayer rug next to the statuette sits a glass jar smeared with what looks like dried blood. In an alcove in the north wall, the floor is slippery from a semi-coagulated pool of blood. The glass jar was used to store the synthetic blood needed by Chabaun to power his animate armor, but as he ran out of the synthetic stuff, he began using real blood from the strike team’s prisoners.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CELLS</h5><p>The west wing contains three examination rooms used as prison cells by the strike team. The rooms are practically empty, with no furniture and without toilets. When the PCs arrive, there are three mystic prisoners still alive, sharing the cells with five dead bodies. One of the survivors is a middle-aged man, the second an elderly lady and the third is a young humanite girl with dry and chafed gills on her neck. The trio is in bad shape and will hardly react to the PCs’ arrival, but will obey if given a direct order that doesn’t require fortitude or willpower (use @Actor[The Frozen Prisoners] stats on page 110). Above the stairs in what used to be the wing’s waiting room, two workbenches have been set up, covered in the same tools and chemicals as those found at the outpost in the palace. The warriors use the workstations to make more of the interrogation drug they use to subdue their prisoners (see the The Interrogation Drug box on page 168 @JournalEntry[02 - Heart of Darkness]). The waiting room contains 2D6 doses of the regular kind, and three doses of the stronger batch made especially for the Emissary. Both variants are highly sought-after on the black market, fetching 500 and 1000 birr per dose, respectively. Trying to sell them will however attract attention, both from the Syndicate gangs and Zalosian agents.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>FINDING THE FRIEND</h4><p>The campaign began with the PCs going off to find their missing friend Noor, and you could consider giving them some good news as a reward at their journey’s end – Noor might still be alive. If you are a benevolent GM, replace one of the surviving prisoners above with Noor. Should you wish to give them a completely different sense of closure however, have them find their friend dead among the flayed bodies on the floor.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>OTHER WAYS OF GETTING INSIDE</h5><p>Since the flooding of the basement and the collapse in the east wing, the main entrance is no longer the only way in. Agile PCs could attempt to climb the rubble to get to the roof of the east wing and then attack the sentries from above. This approach requires that they first swim up to the wall without being seen (INFILTRATION –1) and then climb the unstable rubble (DEXTERITY, critical success or spotted by the guards).<br />Another way inside is to dive down and find a crack in the wall leading into the flooded basement. This requires diving gear, or some equivalent cybernetic or bionic sculpt, plus a successful DEXTERITY test at –1. Once inside, sneaking past guards is resolved with opposed INFILTRATION vs OBSERVATION tests.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> FACTION TECHNOLOGY</h5><p>The strike team cell set up its base in the abandoned hospital after being advised to do so by Gaddar-e-Abrar. The false prophet’s motivation for suggesting the location is that the Astûrban already knew the layout of the facility and had installed secret surveillance gear there to keep tabs on the warriors’ affairs. The faction tech that the strike team has been supplied with through the prophet’s “friends” comes directly from the Astûrban’s armory: hyper-modern ammunition, deadly defense systems, the laser communicator, advanced interrogation equipment – such as drugs and bio scanners – and the powerful radio jammer set up at the Sul-Mahala (which is secretly programmed to keep a certain frequency chosen by the Astûrban open, enabling the secret police to receive data from their spy gear at the hospital).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  ID TAGS</h5><p>The martyr warriors have electronic ID tags in their armor to be able to pass through the security perimeter without being shot at by their own defense systems. The tags also protect against friendly fire in combat, as their homing Vulcan rounds will avoid hitting anyone wearing them, giving them an additional +1 to their initiative rating each round. If the PCs get their hands on one of the ID tags, its frequency pattern can be copied by passing a difficult (–2) data djinn test. It requires access to a tabula or a computer, and the copy must be uploaded to a suitable com unit, such as a personal communicator. Having the right ID signature will get a person through the perimeter (see below), but not without prompting a log entry at the central computer set up in the main admission hall. If the PCs are in luck, the guard at the computer might be elsewhere when they pass the outer sensors.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> GUARDS</h5><p>There are ten martyr warriors at the base, not including Chabaun or Gaddar. Below are some suggested positions around the area, but if the PCs trip the alarms around the base, or if the scouts at the palace radioed ahead to tell their superiors that trouble is coming, the martyr warriors may instead attack the PCs before they make it inside the hospital.</p><ul><li><strong>South Courtyard</strong>: Two warriors, either busy adjusting the Firestorm system installed above the entrance, or keeping an eye on the two gravcraft they use to transport prisoners and gear from the palace.</li><li><strong>Admission Hall</strong>: Chabaun and two warriors, one of whom is keeping an eye on the computers and the laser communicator aimed at the Sul-Mahala through a crack near the ceiling in the south wall. The room is full of crates of ammunition, weapons, and all sorts of gear.</li><li><strong>West Wing</strong>: Two warriors, at the top of the stairs in what used to be a waiting room. They are alert, but at least one of them is either praying at the small altar in the north corner or making more of the interrogation drug at the workbenches by the south wall.</li><li><strong>East Wing</strong>: Three guards. Two act as sentries at either side of the collapsed main corridor where lookouts have been constructed from sheets of durasteel. The sentries have sensors and watch the northern and southern approaches, respectively. The lookouts are manned around the clock. The third warrior is keeping an eye on Gaddar-e-Abrar in the temple.</li><li><strong>Sleeping Warriors</strong>: At least one warrior can usually be found in the dormitory, but during the night, you could decide that the two guards in the courtyard as well as one from both the admission hall and the west wing are there as well, to sleep, cook, or eat. Chabaun only visits his private room five short times a day, to take off his armor and whip himself to honor the Martyr.</li></ul><p>Unless the PCs are especially clumsy, they should be able to infiltrate the base and attack a scattered and surprised enemy. If they trip the alarms however, the warriors quickly get ready for combat and set up an ambush (page 85 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]). How the strike team members do this is up to you as the GM to decide, but they likely stage one ambush in the admission hall and one in the west wing, close to the Emissary’s body.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DEFENSE SYSTEMS</h5><p>The entrance to the admission hall is guarded by a sensor-guided @Item[Firestorm system] (page 127 of the Coriolis core rulebook), and two motion-triggered flamethrowers are mounted on the outer north wall. The area of the swamp surrounding the hospital is booby-trapped with thermal grenades. Spotting the defenses requires observation tests for each of the three systems (with a –1 to spot the grenades). The grenades can be disarmed by passing a demanding (–1) technology test, or one can carefully avoid them by testing dexterity. Failure means setting off a grenade (see @Item[Thermal grenade], page 127 of the Coriolis core rulebook). Getting past the automated weapons by the main entrance is trickier. The weapons are connected to a whole series of sensors that measure things such as heat fluctuations and movement. If the PCs have acquired one of the warriors’ ID tags, they can get close enough to disconnect the weapons by testing data djinn or technology at –1. Failing the test means setting off a silent alarm, alerting the strike team to their intrusion.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>ALSIRSAH</h4><p>The Alsirsah is originally a Dabaran traditional feast where the families of the betrothed meet to finalize the terms of the wedding. The life bond concerns not only the happy couple but their families as well, and the Alsirsah marks the end of an often lengthy period of negotiations over the two sides’ respective duties toward one another. The party is usually thrown by the family who marries upward, to show that they are worthy of the coming union.</p><p>During the banquet, Leod makes a welcome speech praising both the Din Hramas and the other guests – they will act as witnesses when the final contract is signed, making their opinions of the host very important.</p><p><em>“Honored guests and friends, I welcome you with all my heart to the Alsirsah. Tonight, we celebrate the union of the dol-Quassars and the noble Din Hramas, paragons of Zenithian light and wisdom, whom we have to thank for opening our eyes to a new Horizon.</em></p><p><em>Marok dol-Quassar of the proud Dabaran blood – exalted Dabaran who stalwartly fought off the darkness during the Long Night! – seeks the hand of Theda Din Hrama, a child of Ardha, a bringer of light from humanity’s cradle.</em></p><p><em>Honored guests, today is a proud day. May the Icons hear us as we raise our glasses toward the Monolith and pray for their blessing of this blood bond. May they guide us to honor our history and welcome the future.</em></p><p><em>Dearest of friends, may your cups never run dry, your plates never be empty and your spirits lose themselves in music and dance – may this Alsirsah be a fond memory for all of us until She the most Merciful comes to grace us with her slumber. May this day mark the birth of a brighter tomorrow.”</em></p><p>– Leod dol-Quassar, Dabaran nobleman</p></div><h4>NPCS</h4><p>Priot Chabaun Kheml is head of the remaining cell of the strike team. After the death of the Emissary, they are preparing to pack up the operation and leave the Sultra. They have heard the news of the Order assassin in Little Algol, but Chabaun’s zeal blinds him to any political fallout that might come from his operation. The remaining warriors will fight to the death, except for Gaddar-e-Abrar, who very much wishes to survive his mission. He might be open to negotiations with the PCs if they promise him safe passage out of the marshes.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Chabaun Kheml]</li><li>@Actor[Gaddar-e-Abrar]</li><li>@Actor[Warriors of the Holy Light]</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> EVENTS</h5><p>In this scene, the PCs must infiltrate or assault the hospital. Information about layout and guards can be found above, as well as a map of the complex along with descriptions of the different rooms.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TREACHEROUS PATHS</h5><p>The PCs carefully walk through the razor-sharp cirta grass that dominates all solid ground in the Sultra valley. The ground looks steady enough, but might suddenly give way and trap an unlucky PC in the murky mud below. At the cost of 1 DP, a PC gets stuck in the mud or in some tangled roots. Getting up is a slow action and requires a force test. Failure means dropping one random possession into the water before making it to safer ground.</p><ul><li><strong>Mines</strong>: The event can be used to introduce the minefield as the PCs approach the hospital.</li><li><strong>Ambush</strong>: At the cost of 1 additional DP, the martyr strike team suddenly ambushes the group while one PC is stuck in the mud.</li></ul><p>Cost: 1–2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> MINES!</h5><p>The PCs wander into the area mined with thermal grenades by the martyr strike team (see the The Defensive Systems above for more information). If you allow the PCs a chance to spot the danger beforehand, the event will only cost you 1 DP. At the cost of 3 DP however, the first notice of the mines they get is a detonation when one of them walks through a tripwire obscured by the tall grass. After the explosion, they find themselves surrounded by mines on all sides.</p><p>Cost: 1, 3 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PRISONERS</h5><p>Even though the warriors are prepared to fight to the death, the PCs might be able to take prisoners. Gaddar is desperate for a way out of the marsh and will be easier to capture.</p><ul><li><strong>The Fallen Prophet</strong>: When fighting breaks out in the base, Gaddar tries to find a safe place to hide. If he believes that the PCs appear to be winning, he might surrender to them to save himself. He will continue to pose as the strike team’s prophet however, to make sure the Order looks like the ones responsible. If he is attacked by Akouba, or is saved by the PCs from the airstrike, he becomes more than willing to share certain parts of the truth however. He admits to being an undercover Astûrban agent tasked with spying on the strike team, but he won’t say anything about the secret police actually running the operation or about their plans to destabilize the Council and the Consortium. If he is questioned about the strange ship that departed the hospital earlier, his eyes become glassy with fear and he recounts with a trembling voice the arrival of the tall, white-clad Serafs. Chabaun seemed to know of their arrival and kissed the ground at their feet before welcoming them inside.</li><li><strong>Defeated Warriors</strong>: The martyr warriors know very little of the structure of the operation – they are here to rid the Horizon of darkness by dealing with its tainted spawn, the mystics. Their cause is blessed, and the Serafs’ visit is proof of that.</li><li><strong>Chabaun’s Madness</strong>: Chabaun is completely crazy and zealous like never before. Speaking to him at all requires passing an insane (–3) manipulation test, or the use of powerful mystic powers. He might then reveal that he has been chosen to serve as the Martyr’s right hand in the salvation of the Third Horizon by following the teachings of Iria Urahuk. As he wishes to boldly go where no one has gone before and research the nature of corruption, he began flaying his prisoners last week to find more answers. Iria’s spirit talks to him day and night, encouraging him to press on. The Serafs are the Martyr’s eternal love made flesh. If interrogated, he will just sing ancient hymns praising the Martyr, even if tortured. If captured and brought away from the Sultra, it will take months of treatment and interrogation to get anything useful out of him.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DEATH FROM ABOVE</h5><p>If the PCs shut off the jammer, or if you as the GM want to make it a little more obvious that someone else is interfering with the operation, you can play the drone attack while the PCs are inside the hospital, either during their attack on the strike team or later, after the final scene at the Emissary’s deathbed (see The Messenger’s Whisper below). An alert PC can hear whirring engines above the trees and may test observation to realize that a group of small aircraft is fast approaching. A critical success identifies the craft as drones or possibly torpedoes. The PCs have barely enough time to get to safety before the strike hits, with remarkable precision.</p><ul><li><strong>Cover</strong>: Finding cover in time requires a successful dexterity test (provides cover 6). Failure means that the cover is inadequate (cover 3) and a critical success means that the person finds something especially sturdy to get behind (cover 8). If the PCs are unaware of the drones, they may of course not try to find cover.</li><li><strong>Damage</strong>: A missile strike (weapon damage 6, CRIT 1, Extreme range).</li><li><strong>False leads</strong>: The drones are designed to look like they come from the Order of the Pariah, with Zalosian glyphs painted on them. A difficult (–2) culture test, or closer study of shrapnel in a laboratory, reveals that the glyphs appear to have been put on after the construction of the drone, which differs from the Order standards of inserting the glyphs into the cases as they are being molded. A demanding (–1) technology test of the electronics of the payload reveals them to be Zenithian. Examining the site after the strike shows that the drones were very precise, targeting the area where Gaddar was and the rooms mainly used by the strike team, such as the dormitory, the temple, the admission hall, the gravcraft, and Chabaun’s quarters.</li></ul><p>Cost: 3 DP (1 DP if the PCs turned the jammer off)</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"npdEr11ZgNO8Yyj5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296988,"modifiedTime":1682695296988,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"YOMfroAUYC191oYi","sort":0,"_id":"t72nibJepxW6bpXd"}

Your group can consist of all kinds of individuals – the group concept only outlines your most basic reason for sticking together in the Third Horizon. The group concept will also tell you what type of ship you will begin play with, what group talent you will have, and who your patron and nemesis will be. There are five group concepts to choose from: Agents, Mercenaries, Free Traders, Pilgrims and Explorers.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Create your group</div><ol><li>Pick a group concept.</li><li>Pick your spaceship.</li><li>Pick your group talent.</li><li>Pick your patron.</li><li>Pick your nemesis.</li></ol><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Free Traders</h5><p>Commerce is what greases the wheels of the Third Horizon, and the hub of trade in the region is the space station Coriolis. The free traders are the entrepreneurs and innovators of the Horizon, embracers of the new order – with a few exceptions. Tariffs, tolls, and bureaucrats looking to make a quick buck abusing the trade system are all things despised by any free trader. As Free Traders, you will portal jump between the different systems of the Third Horizon, hauling everything from goats on ice or farm machinery to candied Kabra bugs and illegal Vulcan carbines. In small freighters or enormous bulk haulers, you travel silent routes in an ocean of cold starlight. Slipping past corrupt toll collectors, blockade ships and corsairs is all part of your thrilling lives.</p><p>The Free Traders group concept can also be used for:</p><ul><li>Smugglers carrying illegal cargo to the highest bidder.</li><li>Bulk haulers on lonely routes with heavy loads.</li><li>Couriers delivering valuable information.</li></ul><p>Possible character concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Free Traders:</p><ul><li><strong>Negotiator (peddler)</strong>.  If it wasn’t for you, the crew would still be delivering livestock to the asteroid belt. You make sure those sweet birr end up in your bank account.</li><li><strong>Pilot (freighter pilot)</strong>. Someone needs to fly this thing.</li><li><strong>Scientist (technician)</strong>. A ship is only as good as its mechanic or technician. You make sure the group gets anywhere at all.</li><li><strong>Ship worker (deckhand)</strong>. There is always something that needs doing onboard. The others may think that you mainly scrub air filters, but there is no one who knows the ship like you do.</li><li><strong>Ship worker (dock worker)</strong>. You oversee the cargo – a crap job some would say, but this is far from true. Without you, the crew wouldn’t earn a single birr.</li><li><strong>Soldier (legionnaire)</strong>. Corsairs, mercenaries, smugglers. The list of cold-blooded fighters out there in the Dark is long. You and your Vulcan carbine protect the group when the going gets rough.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Mercenaries</h5><p>Not all can enjoy the peace and prosperity of the new era. Old wounds fester in the dark, and the absence of peace means plenty of job opportunities for people like you: Mercenaries. As such, you are often both feared and scorned, yet valuable pawns in the power plays of the factions. Mercenaries can be anything from Legionnaires to hired guns for the Consortium. Typical jobs for you would be crushing rebels on Uharu-9, hunting corsairs in the Border Space, or toppling Dabaran pashas.</p><p>The Mercenaries group concept can also be used for:</p><ul><li><strong>Corsairs</strong> plundering careless free traders on lonely routes.</li><li><strong>Rebels</strong> fighting to free their people from oppression.</li><li><strong>Tactical</strong> teams performing whatever military operations the factions might require.</li></ul><p>Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Mercenaries:</p><ul><li><strong>Soldier (officer)</strong>. Without you, the group would be without discipline. In a crisis, you are quick to take charge.</li><li><strong>Soldier (legionnaire)</strong>. The backbone of any mercenary group. You could be anything from a field medicurg, to a weapons expert or a marine. Regardless, you and your trusty carbine get the job done.</li><li><strong>Trailblazer (scout)</strong>. You make sure your surroundings are clear, be it in the hills of the Xifas ridge or the scrap belt around Qugassa. You could be a sniper, a scout, an ex-burglar or a sensor specialist.</li><li><strong>Pilot (fighter pilot)</strong>. Someone has to fly the iron fist you call your ship, or land your drop pod or armored hovercraft.</li><li><strong>Scientist (technician)</strong>. Tending to your death machines is a rigorous job. Without someone to look after the crew’s equipment, you’d soon be worth about as much as skavara droppings in a dung plant.</li><li><strong>Operative (spy)</strong>. You are the group’s expert on alarm systems and infiltration, and your network of contacts is vast. With your help, the jobs run smoother and require less Vulcan hails than they otherwise would.</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch2/gruppen.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Explorers</h5><p>The Horizon is full of mysteries to uncover. You are truth seekers who refuse to settle for the Bulletin’s oversimplified version of reality. It’s all there, if you just scratch the surface a little. Explorers not only delve into the past, they also push beyond the frontiers of the Horizon – as colonists, curious anthropologists or traveling journalists. As Explorers, you dig through the frozen ruins on Surha, the remnants of the Portal Builders in the jungles of Kua, or search for forgotten colonies along the Enau Arm.</p><p>The Explorers group concept can also be used for:</p><ul><li><strong>Prospectors</strong> seeking valuable minerals in dangerous asteroid belts.</li><li><strong>Colonists</strong> valiantly claiming new settlements for the peoples of the Horizon.</li><li><strong>Correspondents</strong> reporting the news no one else dares to.</li></ul><p>Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Explorers:</p><ul><li><strong>Scientist (archaeologist)</strong>. Whether it’s digging for ruins in the desert or mapping the mysterious gravitation pools, you are an explorer in the truest sense.</li><li><strong>Trailblazer (prospector)</strong>. You know how to find all the Horizon’s riches, from ice ore or Helium-3 to shipwrecks or the finest timber.</li><li><strong>Scientist (technician)</strong>. Whether it’s calibrating the macroscope and the deep space sensors, or repairing the colony’s old grav tractor, you are essential to the group.</li><li><strong>Pilot (freighter pilot)</strong>. The crew would get nowhere without you, especially if the destination is somewhere no one’s been in a while.</li><li><strong>Trailblazer (scout)</strong>. As a colonist or pathfinder, you are vital to discovering both valuables and threats during your travels.</li><li><strong>Data spider (correspondent)</strong>. You are the number one news hunter. No truths slip by your keen eyes and ears.</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch2/planet2.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Agents</h5><p>Birr and Legionnaires are not always the best tools for a faction – sometimes, more subtle means are required. This is where the Agent cells come in. Typical jobs for a group of Agents might be infiltrating Dabaran courts, assassinating dignitaries, tracking down lost relatives, or just keeping the scum on Coriolis in check.</p><p>The Agents group concept can also be used for:</p><ul><li><strong>Judicators</strong> keeping the Coriolis station free from criminals.</li><li><strong>Assassins</strong> making sure that troublemakers disappear.</li><li><strong>Detectives</strong> for hire.</li></ul><p>Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Agents:</p><ul><li><strong>Operative (spy)</strong>. You are the core of the cell with your skill set of infiltration, subtle cons, and surveillance.</li><li><strong>Trailblazer (scout)</strong>. If anyone can follow a trail – in a crowded bazaar or on the vast savannah – it’s you.</li><li><strong>Soldier (officer)</strong>. All groups need organization and contacts, things you possess as well as practical knowledge of combat and social interaction.</li><li><strong>Artist (courtesan)</strong>. You are the true manipulator. Your skill and reputation gets you in anywhere, and what you need doing done.</li><li><strong>Data spider (correspondent)</strong>. You dig through old archives, Bulletin logs and info terminals. No stored information is out of your reach.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> Pilgrims</h5><p>The Pilgrimage is an important rite for everyone in the Horizon, and for some it is their calling. Other pilgrims travel for different reasons than to visit the holy sites: looking for work, searching for wisdom, or spreading joy to the Horizon as traveling circuses. Lastly, there are the nomads of the Horizon. They usually remain in one system or one sector, but sometimes they also travel through the dangerous portal fields. Regardless of why you travel, your lives will be hard and painful. Getting to visit the Dome of the Icons on Coriolis, the Leaning Prayer Tower on Algol, Mira’s Icon City, or the temple city of Lotus on Dabaran is achieved only by the truly dedicated – as is experiencing the joy of the audience as Kassar the Nimble performs his triple salto mortale.</p><p>The Pilgrims group concept can also be used for:</p><ul><li><strong>“Hands”</strong> – traveling workers taking jobs where they are to be found.</li><li><strong>Traveling</strong> circuses made up of entertainers and performers.</li><li><strong>Space nomads</strong>, perpetually trudging the starry void.</li></ul><p>Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Pilgrims:</p><ul><li><strong>Preacher (missionary)</strong>. You preach, see visions, and strive to make the peoples of the Horizon understand the greatness of the Icons.</li><li><strong>Negotiator (diplomat)</strong>. You are the one who makes sure that your crew always gets to your destinations – acquiring new passports and papers with the correct stamps, as well as paying the occasional bribe.</li><li><strong>Ship worker (deckhand)</strong>. You can work just about anywhere, be it on a ship or in a bar – someone with a broad skill set is always needed, and that someone is you.</li><li><strong>Artist (courtesan)</strong>. As a master of the arts of pleasure, you can perform anything from a chai ceremony to intricate dances and the sacred Algolan incense prayers.</li><li><strong>Negotiator (peddler)</strong>. You are a traveling merchant, supplying whatever people are demanding.</li></ul><h4>Spaceship</h4><p>Your PCs will begin play with a spaceship. Decide together as a group which spaceship to pick using the rules and tables in Chapter 7. Your most logical choice would be a ship suited to your group concept, but nothing prevents you from picking one with entirely different qualities. You could also choose to design your ship from scratch using the ship construction rules in Chapter 7. Regardless of your choice, you will begin your adventures in debt.</p><h4>DEBT</h4><p>As you begin playing, you will not yet entirely own your spacecraft. Depending on the ship type you choose, a sizeable debt will lie between you and calling the ship your very own. As you begin playing, your collective debt will be 50% of the ship’s original value. Who you owe the money to is up to you to decide – it could be to your patron, some other NPC, or maybe your nemesis! Whomever you owe the money to will expect regular payments from you – estimate 5% of the total debt per year in monthly payments. In other words, already from the start you will have a very good reason to make sure you make enough birr to keep your ship flying. If you play your cards right you might even find yourselves the rightful owners of your very own spaceship, but it’s a long road getting there.</p><h4>Group Talents</h4><p>When creating your group, pick one of the talents connected to your group concept. Everyone in the group can use this talent. Talents are described in Chapter 4.</p><h4>PATRON AND NEMESIS</h4><p>The Third Horizon is a hard place, and getting anywhere without help is difficult. It has become something of tradition for smaller ship crews to ally themselves with a powerful benefactor. As a group, pick a patron from your group concept list below. If you’d rather come up with a patron of your own, you may, as long as the GM agrees. You will also begin play with an enemy, a nemesis who can suddenly turn up to spoil your plans, or stay in the shadows as a lurking threat. Just like the patron, the nemesis is described briefly below. Pick a nemesis from the list or come up with one of your own.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch2/nasare.webp\" width=\"671\" height=\"1920\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FREE TRADERS’ PATRON/NEMESIS</h5><ul><li><strong>Aldair Jubal (Jubal Imports &amp; Exports)</strong>.

It is a world where ice storms beat down on endless tundra, a poisonous atmosphere that makes living here a nightmare, and extreme cold that forces the few settlements that actually exist to retreat behind thermal shields and armanite walls. The conditions make it one of the few planets in the Kua system that has never been colonized as the costs have been too high and the rewards too little.</h3><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/surha.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>FACTS ABOUT SURHA</h4><ul><li><strong>DIAMETER</strong>: 49,764 km (roughly 3.9 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>EQUATORIAL CIRCUMFERENCE</strong>: 156,338 km (roughly 3.9 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>SURFACE AREA</strong>: 7.8 billion square kilometers (roughly 15 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>GRAVITY</strong>: 1.98 standard gravity</li><li><strong>DAY LENGTH</strong>: 13 hours</li><li><strong>SIDEREAL YEAR</strong>: 165 Kuan years</li><li><strong>AXIAL TILT</strong>:  28 degrees</li></ul></div><h4>ANIALAH’S PHILOSOPHER</h4><p>It hasn’t always been like this, however. During the golden age of the Firstcome, a huge colonization vessel, the Anialah, was constructed and sent to bring the fruits of civilization to Surha. Colonists, thinkers and believers left Kua to turn the ice planet into a promised land. They never did. Contact with the Anialah was lost just after the ship arrived at Surha and it soon became clear that disaster had struck. For a long time, it was believed that the ship had broken apart during its entry into the atmosphere and crashed, leaving no survivors, but then, many years later, a strange signal reached Kua. A person named Adjhani, philosopher and survivor of the Anialah, sent a series of transmissions describing the crash and the time that followed. The story eventually became the “Ramshadra”, one of the most important books of the Firstcome reign. Adjhani spoke of an unforgiving world, but also of the rare moments when the storms subsided and Surha rose from the mists in all its majestic splendor.</p><h4>THE PHILOSOPHER’S LANDS</h4><p>The Ramshadra eventually spawned a religious community that worshipped the words of Adjhani as if they were a message from the Icons themselves. The Ramsha cult is still active today and recruits most of its followers from the Firstcome people. They regard Surha as a holy planet, and the cult’s most important mission is to find what they call the “Philosopher’s Lands”: the place from where Adjhani transmitted the Ramshadra and managed to survive against all odds. But the clues to its location are few and Surha is big and hostile.</p><h4>THE SMUGGLERS’ HAVEN</h4><p>Many cycles passed before humans visited Surha again, and this time the visitors had far from noble intentions. As the fleets were purging the asteroid belt, the smugglers had to move their bases farther and farther towards the Oort cloud. The inhospitable world on the brink of the big black was suddenly the smugglers only choice. When the Rimward Reach was discovered and colonized, Surha’s location suddenly became very favorable, and more smuggler gangs sought shelter under the icy clouds. Small asteroid stations were constructed in the rings of the planet and surface bases were hidden in remote ice deserts. It is in one such base that Abdul Shey, the Horizon’s most notorious smuggler sultan, is said to rest in a magnificent mausoleum designed by the great architect Lovhain.</p><h4>THE FALLEN MOON</h4><p>Surha is mostly covered in ice and snow, enormous wastes of tundra pierced by jagged glacial fangs around which the winds reach hurricane strength. The Harballa massif is the only real mountain range on the planet and its peaks reach tens of kilometers into the sky. The massif, measuring several thousand kilometers in length and a few degrees in width, is actually the remains of what used to be Surha’s moon. The ore-rich moon fell to the planet below hundreds of thousands of years ago, today forming the planet’s most visible landmark. The Harballa is ever so slowly sinking through the ice, and in a couple of thousand years it will have disappeared completely. The moon ore is the planet’s only valuable natural resource and the reason for the existence of a small outpost on the Harballa’s southern slopes. In the last few cycles, the workers’ snow crawlers and mining drills have gone deeper and deeper into the mountain in search of the precious minerals and there are rumors going around about a few curious discoveries in the darkness that have caused the most superstitious of the miners to lay down their tools.</p><h4>THE LAST OUTPOST</h4><p>In the shadow of the mighty Harballa crouches Surha’s only real settlement, the Surhani outpost, called “Hope’s End” by the locals. Underground vaults and protective domes gather hardened miners and indentured freighter pilots as well as the Ramsha followers and one or two bitter entrepreneurs cursing their fate. The settlement is formally owned by the Colonial Agency and the faction’s local representative, Malva Sarhal, makes sure everything is running as it should. A few hundred souls call Surhani their home and manage to live here in peace and relative comfort.</p><h4>LIFE ON SURHA</h4><p>The extreme weather, the toxic atmosphere and the strong gravity make living on the frozen world hard and arduous, but with the right gear, knowledge, and protection, it is possible to lead a decent life. Settlements and bases are often dug into the ice or the rock around the Harballa, and powerful grav generators are installed, an absolute necessity to make the bases habitable. For transportation up on the surface, the inhabitants use snow crawlers, slow but reliable vehicles constructed to withstand everything but the worst storms. Reinforced exo shells are needed if one must be out in the open for a longer period of time, but a cheap air filter and warm clothes are enough for a short walk. Terrible ice storms, often thousands of kilometers wide, plague the planet regularly and anyone out in the open when they hit won’t live long in the extreme weather.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"D7JMSPqYOQ0kRkUn","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266298,"modifiedTime":1680376266298,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"u9EfM0LPMhYs1mpL"}

Xene is a gas giant ten times the size of the planet Kua. Its surface is ravaged by violent storms, many kilometers high and extremely dangerous to all kinds of human vehicles. For a long time, Xene was considered of little interest to anyone but the astronics of the Foundation. The events of the last few cycles have radically changed this, and instead made Xene famous all across the Horizon.</h3><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/xene_ny.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>FACTS ABOUT XENE</h4><ul><li><strong>DIAMETER</strong>: 143,200 km (roughly 11 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>EQUATORIAL CIRCUMFERENCE</strong>: 449,648 km (roughly 11 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>SURFACE AREA</strong>: 64 billion square kilometers (roughly 128 times larger than Kua)</li><li><strong>GRAVITY</strong>: 2.15 standard gravity</li><li><strong>DAY LENGTH</strong>: 9.5 hours</li><li><strong>SIDEREAL YEAR</strong>: 11 Kuan years</li><li><strong>AXIAL TILT</strong>: 86 degrees</li></ul></div><h4>THE GHOSTS FROM XENE</h4><p>They rose from the depths of the gas giant – the ghosts from Xene: the Emissaries. They claim to be messengers, but representing who is shrouded in secrecy. Some say they are the descendants of the Portal Builders, others that they are the restless ghosts of starfarers long since dead. There are even some radical theologists who say the Emissaries are the Icons made flesh. Regardless of the creatures’ origins – their arrival has changed the Horizon forever.</p><h4>MINERAL MINING</h4><p>When the Foundation’s probes discovered huge mineral deposits on Calest, Xene’s third largest moon, it stirred considerable discussion within the prospector community on Coriolis. More reports of promising findings on other moons came in, and suddenly, Xene was on everybody’s lips. The last ten cycles have seen several mining corporations and independent prospectors establishing themselves in the vicinity of the gas giant. It is a dangerous place – many prospectors have been lost in the shadows of Xene.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>INDEPENDENT MINING COLONY “KALDER’S DREAM”</h5><p>Xene’s sixth moon, Eod, houses the raggedy prospector base Kalder’s Dream. The far-from-dreamlike station has only three permanent residents: the worn-out old prospector Kalder, Lanna the cook and cantina owner, and Xoo, the thieving monkey. Miners and prospectors come here after a hard day’s work to drink, eat, and gossip about their finds.</p></div><h4>THE FOUNDATION’S STATION</h4><p>The largest human settlement around Xene is the Foundation’s research installation FS-7. The old station used to have only a small crew of astronics, planetologists, and geologists, but since the mineral discoveries – and especially since the arrival of the Emissaries – the inhabitants of FS-7 have increased manifold. Today, pilgrims from every corner of the Horizon travel to FS-7 to worship the Emissary that still remains on the station.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch12/Kapitel_6_ikonerna.webp\" /></div></div></div></div>"},"_id":"lEleuYJTrAUJDsAK","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376267004,"modifiedTime":1680376267004,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"uCn40bDYZzM6u7DG","sort":0,"_id":"uAxoSW7QlHKfzN61"}

How the ensuing confrontation ends will depend heavily on what help they have had along the way. The events described for this lead the PCs into a final battle and should set them up to find enough information in the base to complete their mission. They should have enough information to continue directly into the next part of the campaign, The Kuan Connection (page 96 @JournalEntry[Introduction - Kuan Connection]).</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs arrive at the base just as the strike team is preparing a group of drop pods for the journey to Kua. Some of the station’s few remaining mystics are forced into stasis beds and then loaded onto the pods. The Emissary is long since gone, sent to Kua and taken through the jungles to the strike team’s headquarters by the Monolith (see The Kuan Connection). The same goes for Noor, or whomever it is the PCs are trying to rescue. The PCs might have been given clues or tips by the residents of the Cellar on the way down that could make breaking into the strike team’s base easier (see below).</p><p>The scene is open and it is up to you as the GM to improvise depending on how the PCs plan their attack, how they move around (see the map below), and how the martyrs and their leader Salamah ach-Abaud act.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE Strike team’S ORDERS</h5><p>The martyr strike team has strict orders on how to act if their base is discovered. The first response should of course be to neutralize the attackers, while shipping out the remaining mystics, regardless of whether they have received unmonitored entry clearance to Kua from the Guard or not. If they are unable to defend the base, the hangar is to be blown. Explosives are already in place.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The most important information in this scene is that drop pods are sent to Kua from the ejection ramp in the hangar. Make sure that when the PCs get their first glimpse of the hangar from the inside (or the dock if they approach from the outside), a pod is just being launched and another one prepared. This can be seen when entering the hangar, from the outside, if the PCs are performing a spacewalk to reach the camp, or through the video feed of any hacked surveillance cameras:</p><ul><li><strong>Kua’s Pods</strong>: In the following scenario, The Kuan Connection, two pods have just been sent down, both containing a message to the strike team’s representatives on Kua that it is time to tie up loose ends and shut down the operation.</li></ul><p>During and after the fight with strike team, the PCs have their suspicions about the warriors' backgrounds confirmed:</p><ul><li><strong>The Order</strong>: Many items in the base as well as a few temporary altars are clearly Zalosian, confirming that it is the Order of the Pariah that are responsible for the kidnappings (see the Personal Effects event below).</li><li><strong>Kidnapped Victims</strong>: The prisoners in the hangar are marked with either a black or a white cross on their foreheads – black means mystic, white means non-mystic.</li></ul><p>You should let one of the drop pods remain in the hangar to give the PCs a chance to examine it for clues:</p><ul><li><strong>The Destination</strong>: The pods are all programmed with a specific course and crash vector. data djinn is required to extract the coordinates from the pod, and science is required to cross-reference it with Kua’s land mass to pinpoint the destination – a dense jungle canyon on the Verkâna ridge situated in Kua’s southern hemisphere.</li></ul><h4>THE MARTYR STRIKE TEAM’S BASE</h4><p>The strike team has set up camp in an abandoned freighter hangar. The docking mechanisms are broken, and the commandos have installed their own ejection ramp that they use when sending the drop pods to Kua. An old service airlock has been repaired to allow them to receive new pods manually. The rest of the base is sparsely furnished, containing only a row of cages, an open bed chamber, a Martyr chapel, and a small kitchen. The hangar is used for storage of mystics in stasis awaiting transportation. A “blink” – an unmonitored entry vector – is delivered via encrypted coms when it is time to make a delivery.</p>@JournalEntry[The Martyr Strike Team's Base Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SECURITY SYSTEMS AND GUARDS</h5><p>The base is surrounded by multiple sensors, placed in the corridor that runs outside the hangar. The sensors' coverage areas overlap and an alarm is triggered if they are disabled or disrupted. The only way for the PCs to pass them unnoticed is to hack them without interrupting the feed, and then program a sensor loop. This requires a successful technology test at –2 or a data djinn test at –3. Critical success, or prior knowledge from The Third Sphere, also gives them the knowledge of how to move past the cameras without being seen. Failure means that the guard in the guard room spots them and sounds a silent alarm, shortly after which a group of warriors storm the corridor. The strike team commandos don’t patrol the corridor, choosing to rely on their sensors. If the PCs manage to fool the security system, there will be between one and four warriors is the guard room depending on the time of day.</p><p><strong>The Security System</strong>: If the group chooses to hack the sensor grid and the computers they are linked to using data djinn, they will discover that there are cameras inside the hangar as well, and that one of them is online. Through the camera feed they can see some stasis beds and part of a drop pod on an ejection ramp. By passing another data djinn test (or scoring a critical success on the first roll), they can see a localized communication system in the hangar, which only appears to be able to receive, not send. The receivers are placed on two pillars near the main hangar door and the pod ejection ramp. This is the rigging set up by Salamah ach-Abaud to trigger, remotely by voice command, the two explosives mounted on the main supporting pillars (if things should turn ugly). The PCs cannot tamper with the com system from the outside as Salamah’s voice command is required to set off the charges. They won’t be able to blow the base up – deliberately or by accident.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>PERSONAL EFFECTS</h4><p>The PCs will find the warriors' personal effects if they search the base, or the bodies of the martyr warriors. Some examples of what they might find are described below:</p><ul><li><strong>Prayer Beads</strong>: A set of prayer beads in the shapes of tiny skulls, made from different kinds of wood, stone, and metal. The wearer counts the beads while praying. CULTURE can reveal that this particular necklace is a made as a reminder of death, keeping the devout aware that everything, no matter how solid and eternal it may appear, will one day crumble and disappear.</li><li><strong>A Holy Book</strong>: A Zalosian prayer book, honoring the Martyr and the prophecy of “The Return of Darkness” (a more complete version than the one recited by Bathos, the Mad poet):</li></ul><p><em>“There will come a time when mankind turns to darkness once more</em><br /><em>When the unworthy speak without tongues</em><br /><em>When sister betrays sister</em><br /><em>When the light of peace nourishes the servants of darkness</em><br /><em>When brother kills brother</em><br /><em>Only they who live in the darkness will see the light”</em></p><ul><li><strong>Talisman of the Martyr</strong>: A meteoric iron pendant, shaped like a serpent. CULTURE reveals it to be Ourbos, the eternity aspect of the Martyr, worn by soldiers for protection. The talisman is blessed and provides a +2 bonus when praying to reroll, but only when the act is to avoid direct, physical damage, or when performing a self-sacrificing test.</li><li><strong>Dagger</strong>: A dagger with Zalosian writing on it. A PC with CULTURE can read the inscription: “Righteous Leveller.”</li><li><strong>Prayer Rug</strong>: Personal prayer rug with stylized spaceships on it. Small ships and torpedoes (PILOT will reveal them to be injectors) approach a strange-looking craft with crenelated wings. A successful CULTURE test reveals that the patterns appear to be from Zalos-B, the system of the heretics.</li></ul></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MODIFIED HANGAR</h5><p>The map describes the different places of interest in the hangar but not the locations of the martyr warriors or any specific objects. The NPCs section describes the warriors and their gear, as well their potential posts throughout the base.</p><ul><li><strong>Transport Shaft</strong>: A deep transport shaft spanning several floors. There is no gravity in the shaft and the airlocks to each floor open inwards and upwards. Most airlocks are broken or, as on the strike team’s floor, welded shut. Ladders run the length of the shaft along the walls.</li><li><strong>Ladder and Access Tunnel</strong>: There is a small ledge on each floor connecting to a narrow corridor leading to the wider corridor. The doors between the corridors are not locked and look like they are used regularly.</li><li><strong>Wide Corridor</strong>: A corridor wide enough for two ground loaders to pass each other, connecting the different freighter hangars on this level. The martyr strike team has mounted multiple sensors along the walls. The two sensors outside the bed chamber are broken. Awl the skavara knows about the broken sensors (see the The Skavara Market scene on page 76 @JournalEntry[02 - In the Court of the Slummer Queen]).</li><li><strong>Guard Room</strong>: A large gateway toward the wide corridor, with sides of corrugated duralite. The door is suspended from rails in the ceiling. The wall on the other side of the room is one huge airlock, kept open. There are tables to the right in the room where a computer and a few old monitors are hooked up to ancient cables coming out of the wall. The guard is usually sitting by the screen but will approach the door if it is opened.</li><li><strong>Bunkroom and Kitchen</strong>: An old store room made into a bed chamber, containing military style bunkbeds. There is a small kitchen unit in the far corner, a small table, and a small refrigeration unit, hooked up to a portable reactor of foreign make. A difficult (–2) technology test will reveal that it is a portable thermal reactor made by the Order of the Pariah.</li><li><strong>Temple</strong>: A makeshift temple celebrating the Martyr containing half a dozen whips, haircaftans, and cilices – spiked ribbons worn inside out to inflict pain in honor of the Martyr. A single Icon figure looms above an altar in the back of the room, identifiable as the Martyr, the name given to the Judge Icon by the Order of the Pariah. There are simple prayer rugs on the floor (the patterns contain typical Order motifs, something which culture can reveal). Below the Icon statue, a parchment containing Urahuk’s Statutes has been affixed to the wall. The text is in old Zalosian which requires a successful culture test to read. The parchment looks to be at least a century old. medicurgy reveals that the text is written on human skin rather than paper – tattooed on a living martyr most likely, and cut from the body after her death. The text resembles the words Noor, the PCs’ friend, said to brother Ramas at the Sanatorium (see the prophecy under Personal Effects above.)</li><li><strong>Hangar</strong>: A large hangar, with an open airlock inwards at one end, and a closed gate toward space on the other. Large signs with writing in Zeni on the walls warn about decompression and arrows describe the direction of the movement of the airlock doors. Duralite beams support the ceiling. An old crane hangs from rails in the ceiling by the closed gate. There are three dark pods parked on loaders – also on rails – by the gate. Most of the hangar is open and tidy, but along the walls are piles or debris, a row of cages, the stasis beds, and one launch-ready drop pod.</li><li><strong>Cages</strong>: Tiny, rectangular cages, made from duralite plates and steel bars. There are no toilets in the cages, and the whole area around the cells reeks of excrement. When the PCs arrive, only six of the prisoners are still alive, three of which are mystics. Five corpses are spread out across the cages, some of them sharing a cell with a living prisoner:</li></ul><ol><li>Kiran – Arrash pusher from the Spice Plaza, middle-aged woman (mystic)</li><li>Saira – Student from Ahlam’s Courtesan Academy, young woman</li><li>Farrukh – Stevedore from the Saltaara spaceport, middle-aged man</li><li>Aisha – Apathetic child, girl (mystic)</li><li>Dipa – Terrified child, girl</li><li>Arif Shamoun – Heir to wealthy merchant, sad boy (mystic)</li></ol><p>The prisoners are very weak and hardly react when the PCs arrive. They will follow direct orders as long as it doesn’t require strength or willpower.</p><ul><li><strong>Stasis Beds</strong>: Empty stasis beds, stacked on top of each other, two by five along the wall. The crane railing runs just above.</li><li><strong>Drop Pods</strong>: Three oval pods of the Heirmat model on loaders. A successful pilot test reveals that they were made at the Hegemony’s dockyards. Using the crane (pilot test), one can move a pod to the ejection ramp. This takes a few minutes.</li><li><strong>Ejection Ramp</strong>: A ramp made by the martyr strike team. It contains a pod ready for launch. The ramp ends at a circular iris gate in the wall. The gate has ED technology and can be opened to let a pod through without having to go through an airlock cycle.</li><li><strong>Airlock</strong>: A regular airlock large enough for four people in exos. A cycle (to move through the airlock) takes a few minutes.</li><li><strong>Hangar Gate</strong>: A hangar gate for spacecraft, repaired but welded shut. It was originally designed to fit shuttles, small freighters, and scooters but the hangar was condemned by Station Maintenance after an accident, thus allowing the martyr strike team to claim it without any trouble from the Guard or the judicators.</li><li><strong>Salamah’s Ship</strong>: Salamah ach-Abaud’s injector is docked with magnet clamps outside the airlock. It is black and very hard to spot unless one knows where to search for it.</li></ul><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/salamah_full.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE INJECTOR</h4><p>The injector is an armored space scooter carrying one pilot and a passenger, or a metric ton of extra cargo. It’s almost impossible to open without the deacon’s permission and is fitted with a security mechanism that makes the ship explode if someone tries to break into it. This has the same effect as an antimatter torpedo. The self-destruct mechanism is linked to the injector’s kinetic intelligence and will warn any would-be burglars of their imminent death if they continue their attempts. Breaking into the ship is hard, but not impossible. It requires an insane (–3) DATA DJINN test, while another PC performs a hard (–2) TECHNOLOGY test at the same time. Success with both tests will disarm the security mechanism and antimatter bomb, while rebooting the kinetic intelligence to give access to the pilot’s seat.</p><table><thead><tr><th>CLASS: I (Karrmerruk shipyards, Zalos)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>EP: 3</td></tr><tr><td>HP: 2</td></tr><tr><td>MANEUVERABILITY: +2</td></tr><tr><td>SIGNATURE: -3</td></tr><tr><td>ARMOR: 2</td></tr><tr><td>SPEED: 4</td></tr><tr><td>MODULES: Cargo Hold (1 ton, or extra passenger), Torpedo System (1 Antimatter torpedo, 1 ion torpedo, 4 mines)</td></tr><tr><td>FEATURES: Atmospheric Entry, Stealth Technology, Precise Thrusters (+2 to PILOT when docking or taking evasive action in space combat), Ship Intelligence (attributes 1, skills 3)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Artifacts &amp; Faction Tech</h5><p>Several of the factions in the Third Horizon have performed specialized research and investigations of the remnant weapon systems and mystical artifacts left behind and forgotten after the devastation of the Portal Wars.

A few cycles ago, there was an accident in the hangar that tore up the hangar gate and vented the room. The unit was condemned and the doors inward were sealed. It still looks as if the hangar is sealed up, but a closer look reveals that the welding has been cut open with a plasma torch and that cables from the ceiling in the corridor has been diverted through the ventilation and into the hangar.<br />The martyr strike team has repaired the hangar using material brought to them by the smuggler Dara Hirsha, from Kua. This has allowed the commandos to repurpose it for their needs. As it only has one point of entry, it is easily defendable and the sensors outside warn of intruders.</p><ul><li><strong>The Martyr Warriors</strong>: There are seven warriors in the hangar when the PCs arrive, including deacon Salamah. More could show up if the GM spends DP (see Reinforcements, page 57 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 3 - Skills]), or if the PCs fail to pass through the Sanatorium without being detected by the Samaritans.</li><li><strong>Guards on Duty</strong>: The strike team observes Kuan time during the mission, and more of them will be awake during the morning, day, and evening watches than during the night watch.</li><li><strong>The Temple</strong>: Praying to the Martyr is traditionally done in the morning and at the beginning of the evening watch (culture or a Zalosian background will tell the PCs this). During the day, the warriors train in the hangar, interrogate and torture their prisoners, or prepare captured mystics for transportation to Kua.</li></ul><p>The obvious way in is through the door from the corridor, but the GM could reward enterprising players with alternative points of entry, to use to get in or to create a distraction:</p><ul><li><strong>The Corridor and the Door</strong>: The door is locked with a simple code lock that can be hacked using data djinn or disabled using technology. It is quickly taken care of (slow action), which makes the sensors the main thing to worry about. If the power to the hangar is cut, forcing the door open requires a successful force test at –1.</li><li><strong>The Sensors</strong>: See the description of the sensor grid under Security Systems and Guards above. If the power is cut, the sensors stop working.</li><li><strong>Spacewalk</strong>: The PCs could cut a hole in the hull on one of the floors above or below the base and then spacewalk the rest of the way. The main hangar gate is welded shut and cannot be opened. The iris gate by the ejection ramp requires a successful technolgy test at –2 to open from the outside. If the roll is successful and there were extra sixes, the PCs could also tamper with the ramp to make sure the last pods are stuck in the hangar. The security protocols on the regular airlock can be overridden with a data djinn test, forcing them to open without activating the cycle and thereby causing explosive decompression in the hangar (page 84 @JournalEntry[04 - The Martyr's Embrace]). The ED fields are no longer working and everyone in the hangar will be affected, including the prisoners. The cell bars will stop them from being sucked into space, but they will be subjected to the vacuum (test force, or choose who lives and who dies). Youths and adults have a Strength score of 2 and 5 HP, children have Strength 1 and 3 HP. None of the prisoners have a force score.</li><li><strong>The Cables</strong>: When the hangar was being repaired by the strike team, they hooked it up to the power grid in the Cellar. As they are so close to the reactor, the stability is rather decent despite the years of neglected service. The PCs can cut the power to the hangar by passing a technolgy test, but they must first pass an infiltration test at –1 to sneak up through the ventilation shaft in the ceiling without the guards inside hearing them.</li><li><strong>The Ventilation Shaft</strong>: The opened vent shaft leads to the strike team’s temple. Passing a dexterity test enables a small person – such as a child or an adult with a Strength score of no more than 2 – to crawl inside.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A LAST RESORT</h5><p>If deacon Salamah is cornered or captured, she can set off the explosives in the hangar remotely. Two medium size breach charges are fastened to the supporting beams closest to the hangar gate. At the cost of 2 DP, Salamah can activate the detonation sequence by speaking a code sentence into her throat link: ”For righteous victory, in the shadow of the Martyr!”</p><ul><li>If the PCs discover the charges before they blow (a test for observation in the hangar, or a critical success on the previous hacking of the security system), they can be disarmed by two separate technolgy tests (two slow actions) or one difficult (–2) data djinn test (one slow action). Failure means that the charges blow.</li><li>Each charge weighs about 10 kilos (blast effect 8, CRIT 2). When they blow, they will destroy the airlock and the hangar gate, but spare at least one of the remaining pods (so the PCs can use it for the next adventure).</li><li>As per the normal explosion damage rules, anyone standing within Close range of the support beams is hit by an eight dice explosion attack. Everyone else in the hangar each suffers a two dice explosion attack and the entire area is hit by an explosive decompression (page 57 @JournalEntry[03 - Connecting the Dots]). The broken hull can be repaired using a slow action and a demanding (–1) technology test.</li></ul><p>Cost: 2 DP</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/martry_embrace.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> RESONANCE – AN ICON’S SWAN SONG</h5><p>As the PCs approach the secret base, you could let mystic PCs receive a final message from the Emissary. You can use this event as an omen that they are on the right track and to build up tension before the final battle.<br />During the climb down the shaft, just a floor or two from the hangar, a flashing pain suddenly shoots through the mystic’s head. Everything goes dark and all sounds appear far away. The melody from the earlier visions come back as the PC’s heart starts racing.

They encounter the fleeing mystic Althea who is being hunted by the martyr strike team disguised as members of the Coriolis Guard.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The PCs are waiting for their friend at Madame Shari’s chai house when the scene begins. Choose one of the PCs for Althea to approach. Act or read out the following text:</p><p><em>You are waiting for your friend at Madame Shari’s chai house in the Neoptra. The chiming of the bells marking the beginning of the night watch is drowned out by the turmoil of the spaceport: shouting merchants, crying children, conversations in dozens of foreign languages, and the high pitched chatter of a group of Kuan monkeys on the roof above you. Cheap speakers blast this segment’s smash hit from the Bulletin. You can’t make out the words, but the throbbing rhythms can be heard over the chaos around you – pop music as an actual pulse in the heart of the Horizon.</em></p><p><em>Noor should have been here ages ago. In the brief recorded message sent to you, ne had sounded worried about something – which, these days, isn’t all that strange. The Bulletin reports almost daily about unrest on the station, about disappearances, arson, and violence. People blame Algolan rebels, scheming Draconites, and the increasingly powerful Syndicate akbars, but above all others, they blame the ghost from Xene. The mysterious Emissary has, since its arrival almost a cycle ago, been accused of foul play more and more whenever something goes wrong onboard the station.</em></p><p><em>You sit and watch the people in the waiting hall outside the chai house when suddenly a well-dressed woman pushes her way through the crowd, followed by angry curses. She spots you, looks around nervously, and starts running toward your table. A group of guards breaks out of the crowd behind her, shouting at her to stop. The woman lunges at [PC], grabbing hold of your clothes, overturning your bowl of sugared dates which shatters on the floor.</em></p><p><em>“You there! Are you friends of Noor?” She breathes heavily, panicking. “Your friend… I… Please, you have to help me!”</em></p><p>Just as you have finished reading the text above, the game is on and the fake guards rush up to the PCs to try and “arrest” Althea. The fake guards have bribed the real squad who normally patrol the Neoptra to stay away. How the confrontation plays out is up to the PCs. You can use the Events section below for inspiration.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>Below are the “keys” that the PCs must take away from the opening scene. Keep them in mind, but introduce them in a believable way.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ALTHEA</h5><ul><li><strong>The Survivor</strong>: Althea must either be rescued in the scene, or be allowed to escape so that the PCs can find her again when the dust settles. She possesses vital information for the scenario and must survive long enough for the PCs to have a conversation with her.</li><li><strong>The Disease</strong>: Althea has the mystic’s disease. She discovered it about a cycle ago, when her telekinetic powers started to manifest. She got to know Noor during the last Cyclade, and they have since helped each other live with the burden of their awakening mystic powers.</li><li><strong>The New Friend</strong>: About a week ago, Noor was contacted by another victim of the disease, the frightened deckhand Aram Yafa.</li><li><strong>The Guards</strong>: Althea was supposed to meet with Noor and Aram in the Ozone Plaza a few days ago, but instead, a group of guards showed up.</li><li><strong>The Player Characters</strong>: The guards have been after her since then, but earlier today, she managed to get to Noor’s apartment in the Core where she found the message to the PCs. En route to the meeting with the PCs, she was spotted by the guards again</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FAKE GUARDS</h5><p>You should supply the PCs with one or more of the following clues so that they realize that they are not dealing with real members of the Guard.</p><ul><li><strong>Appearance</strong>: The guards are clean shaven and speak Zeni with a faint accent. Passing an insane  (–3) <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">culture</strong> test allows a PC to recognize the accent as Zalosian. If one or more PCs are from Zalos, or if they have an actual conversation with the guards (when they try to arrest Althea for example), the difficulty is reduced to demanding (–1).</li><li><strong>Bribes</strong>: If the situation escalates to include violence, the guards at the post by the entrance to the waiting hall will not be able to stand idly by. The real (bribed) guards under inspector Ahuro’s command will arrive on the scene, and the fake guards will exit immediately. The PCs should notice that inspector Ahuro seems strangely disinclined to pursue the imposters.</li><li><strong>Behavior</strong>: If a fight breaks out, a strategically trained PC might spot certain patterns in the combat tactics of the guards. Passing a demanding (–1) <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> test allows a PC to determine that the guards seem to have military training, rather than the usual Coriolis Guard training.</li><li><strong>Weapons</strong>: The guards are more heavily armed that what is normal for a Ring patrol – Vulcan carbines and dura knives rather than Vulcan pistols and shock sticks – something which a successful <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> or <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">command</strong> test can tell the PCs.</li></ul><h4>THE NEOPTRA SPACEPORT</h4><p>The starting scene takes place in the Neoptra spaceport and possibly in the Stevedore Central underneath. Both locations are described in the Coriolis Core Rulebook on page 250 @JournalEntry[The Ring]. See also the map on the next page.</p>@JournalEntry[The Neoptra Spaceport Scene]<h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE HANGARS</h5><p>The Neoptra is the largest of Coriolis' four commercial spaceports, located adjacent to the Spice Plaza. It consists of an enormous hall with hangar doors on many levels along the hull of the Ring. Armanite pillars support three large, crescent-shaped balconies harboring docks and landing platforms. The lowest balcony and the floor of the hall house simpler docks where functionality trumps aesthetics, and a vast network of loading cranes and grav shafts connect to the vents, corridors, and hangars of the Stevedore Central below. These levels are reserved for freighters coming in from reloading on the Net or that are transporting cargo from the bulk haulers that pass through the system once every few weeks. The higher balconies are more adorned and used by tourists, traveling merchants, and pilgrims.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE WAITING HALL</h5><p>Before you get to the actual docks, you pass through the waiting hall. The pillars here are decorated with beautiful reliefs, the floors are white Kuan marble rather that steel and concrete, and mosaics surround subtly splashing fountains. Travelers, peddlers, and stacks of smaller crates share the space with travel agencies, exchange offices, and all sorts of shops. Many visitors choose to rest a bit in one of the many cantinas or in the courtesan salon to get away from the crowds. The main exit takes you past the customs station and the security checkpoint to the bustle of the Spice Plaza and the market streets of the Promenade.</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>In this scene, the PCs will encounter Althea, the martyr strike team, and possibly Merk Ahuro and his guards.</p>@Actor[Althea]<p>@Actor[Merk Ahuro]<br /></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/merk_full.webp\" /></div><p></p>@Actor[Martyr Warriors]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/02-wake/guards_full.webp\" /></div>@Actor[The Coriolis Guard]<h4>Events</h4><p>The tempo in the opening scene is high, and the events for the scene are therefore quite few.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FAKE GUARDS</h5><p>Immediately following Althea’s stormy introduction at the PCs' table, the angry, commanding voices of a group of guards are heard as the uniformed imposters make their way through the crowd toward the chai house. They are unusually rough, pushing people in their way into kawah trolleys and fountains. As the guards are approaching, Althea pleads with the PCs for help, promising to tell them all she knows if they get her to safety. The fake guards will try to arrest her, and if the PCs get in their way, a very heated argument will follow (that might turn into a gunfight if the martyr warriors feel threatened).</p><ul><li><strong>The Survivor</strong>: Althea must survive this encounter, and if the PCs cannot get the guards to back off, she will use her telekinetic powers to clear an escape route for herself and head for the spaceport and the underlying network of tunnels at the Stevedore Central.</li><li><strong>Commotion</strong>: If Althea escapes, the guards will take out their aggressions on the PCs. If the PCs back down, they will shove them violently aside anyway, and pursue the fleeing Althea. If a fight breaks out, or if the two groups get stuck in an angry discussion, the real guards will have to intervene. Inspector Ahuro will head for the chai house to resolve the conflict (see below).</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> INSPECTOR AHURO ARRIVES</h5><p>If the situation escalates – for example if a fight breaks out – the corrupt inspector Ahuro will feel forced to step in to sort out what is going on. He has accepted a rather substantial bribe to stay away from the martyr strike team’s business, and will be reluctant to intervene. He will be smart about balancing his split loyalties, however, ordering his squad to advance slowly and loudly toward the chai house. The fake guards will hear Ahuro’s squad coming, and everyone at the chai house will see the crowds outside slowly being parted by the shouting guardsmen. The martyr warriors will try to escape, either by going after Althea or by getting away from the spaceport to regroup and find the PCs again at a later time.</p><ul><li><strong>Surrounded</strong>: If the PCs have managed to surround or disarm the fake guards, Ahuro will order the PCs to drop their weapons and lay face down on the floor. In the commotion when Ahuro’s squadron secures the chai house, the martyr strike team will escape, and the real guards will let them, shooting a few carefully misdirected warning shots after them.</li><li><strong>Arrested</strong>: If the PCs cause a scene, Ahuro will arrest them and let them sweat in the cells at the nearby Guard point for a few hours, insinuating all sorts of unpleasentness unless they pay him a hefty bribe to release them and then stay out of trouble for good.</li></ul><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE STEVEDORE CENTRAL</h5><p>If the PCs don’t help Althea with the guards, she will escape from the waiting hall and disappear into the Stevedore Central’s maze of tunnels. After the incident at the chai house is resolved, the PCs could try to find her there. If they did help her, however, she will suggest that they head for a more discreet location. She will lead the group through the spaceport and down into the service shafts that run inside the skeleton of the station. This is a dark, strange place of dripping moisture and flickering lights. Big crates and containers are transported through the tunnels by stevedores in loader exos or on ground loaders, working in focused silence under the watchful gaze of grim-faced supervisors. Spirits are higher in the Free League’s cantina, however, located at the heart of the Stevedore Central. The establishment, which consists of one big room, is a mix between a coffin hotel, kawahnio (small café), cantina, and day room. There is a kitchen running along one of the sides of the room and tables, cots, and small sleeping modules have been mounted on the beams and pillars running from floor to ceiling. Cooking smells, tabak and arrash fumes, and the sweat of hundreds of stevedores fill the room. When the ventilation systems are down, the pungent smell travels all the way up to the spaceport. The corridors and recesses surrounding the central are full of secret, makeshift hideaways where stevedores sometimes sleep, or even live. Read more about the Stevedore central on page 250 @JournalEntry[The Ring] in the Coriolis Core Rulebook. This is where the PCs need to go for information about the area, such as where the fleeing Althea has disappeared to, or details about Aram Yafa later in the scenario. The PCs could, among others, encounter the following NPCs here:</p><ul><li><strong>Xiu Xichama (Stevedore Akbar)</strong>: An aging Xinghur from Lubau and one of the most respected and trustworthy akbars in the central. Xiu is a member of the Free League and has access to help from all League-affiliated stevedores and deckhands. She is also close friends with several pilot akbars on the Net, and can arrange transport there – secretly, if necessary. She has not been involved in refugee smuggling, but has noticed the increased demand, especially in the last segment. Unless the PCs have working class backgrounds, she will be cold and dismissive. She might be persuaded to let the PCs into the Stevedore Central, but she will not tell them where Althea went. They can come back here later for information about Aram Yafa however.</li><li><strong>Rauw (Skavara)</strong>: An unexpected inhabitant of the central is Rauw the skavara. The stevedores view the tiny semi-intelligence as a mascot and bringer of good fortune, and make sure to bring him food and shiny trinkets that the little creature quickly stashes away somewhere secret deep below the docks. Rauw is not much of a talker, but if he likes the looks (or scent) of someone, he does his best to help, and no one knows the tunnels here like Rauw does. He can show the PCs the smuggler tunnels from the docks to the cellars underneath the Spice Plaza, be he doesn’t know who uses them. If the PCs are kind to Rauw and give him food or something shiny, he will happily show them where Althea is hiding (if she fled here).<br />If the PCs are taken to the Stevedore Central by Althea, both Xiu and Rauw will be friendly toward them and include them in the worker community. They are welcome to use the Central as a hiding place whenever they are on Coriolis, so as the GM you should let the Central be a sanctuary from guards and martyr warriors.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ALTHEA’S CLUES</h5><p>When the PCs have exited the waiting hall, either through the tunnels under the Neoptra or through the crowds on the Spice Plaza, they will eventually find a more private place where they can be alone with Althea. If she was forced to flee the chai house to escape the fake guards, she will instead wait until the heat has died down and then seek out the PCs again. If they didn’t try to help with the fake guards, she will approach them cautiously.<br />Nervously, Althea can tell them the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The Friend</strong>: She is a close friend of Noor’s. They met roughly a year ago during the Cyclade celebrations and started hanging out more and more. Noor told her about nirs illness – visions and dreams showing nem where to find lost things (the mystical talent Find) – which gave Althea the courage to tell nem about the time she made a balcony in the Mulukhad collapse by the force of her will.</li><li><strong>The Kidnappings</strong>: A segment or so ago, the Bulletin started reporting about a wave of kidnappings and murders. When the rumors that the victims were all  mystics were confirmed, Althea wanted to go underground.</li><li><strong>Like-Minded</strong>: Noor contacted her about a week ago, wanting her to meet another mystic, Aram Yafa. Noor only told Althea that Aram was a deckhand who lost his job when his powers started to manifest.</li><li><strong>The Meeting</strong>: She never got to meet Aram. A couple of days ago, Noor had arranged for the three to meet at the Ozone Plaza outside Al-Said’s Oporium, a well known tabakery, at the beginning of the second watch (at lunch time). Instead of Noor and Aram, a group of guards showed up and tried to arrest her.</li><li><strong>The Escape</strong>: Althea used her powers to evade arrest and hid in a basement in Little Horizon, as far away from the Promenade and the Ozone Plaza as possible.</li><li><strong>The Search</strong>: This morning, she finally left her hiding place and went to Noor’s apartment in the student barracks near the Academy tube stop in the Student district. The room looked untouched, but the guards showed up again and she barely made it out.</li><li><strong>Help</strong>: Althea found Noor’s communicator and saw several messages from Aram, as well as the message sent to the PCs. When guards showed up to search Noor’s apartment, Althea saw no other option but to try to find Noor’s friends. In the commotion, she accidentally dropped the com as she ran from the apartment.</li></ul><p>After the conversation, Althea will leave the PCs to go hide again. If they promise to keep her safe or can offer her someplace to hide, she will come with them instead.<br />Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"mA1knBMbnX0oAyoy","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296396,"modifiedTime":1682695296396,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mAHpd3t9ttfiOKXR","sort":0,"_id":"vd1pyDf109nUj1Cj"}

Mighty temples, Icon churches, and cloister palaces preside in gilded bliss over the hearts of the planet’s city-states. Pilgrims and merchants flock to the planet, as well as both their protectors and their exploiters.</h3><p><strong>Mira is full</strong> of Firstcome wonders: winding pilgrim trails, the floating traffic in the Icon City, ascetic monks in the forgotten valleys of Menau, and much more. The Horizon’s best grav projectors also come from here – made in the legendary Chelebs dockyards.</p><h4>THE MIRA SYSTEM</h4><p>Mira is a trinary system. There is a second star called Mira-B, or Antmira, and a third called Mira-C, or Menau. Both Antmira and Menau have planets suitable for human habitation, but they are nowhere near as rich as the planet Mira. Trigon in Antmira is an industrialized world that seems to be of more interest to the Zenithian factions than to the Mirans themselves. Menau is remote, and home to scattered colonies and temples belonging to the Circle of Seekers.</p><h4>THE CRADLE OF COLONIZATION</h4><p>The city-states of Mira are the cradle of Firstcome colonization and are considered by many to be its pinnacle – a loose federation of states that have enjoyed centuries of peaceful competition. Today, power is shared between the Church of the Icons, the Cities and the Chelebs-Menau family. The Church controls the Icon City from high up in the flying Temple City. The other large cities on the planet, like Bandar Asul, Tifret, and Cimoran, are ruled by local courts, but the Church maintain a presence everywhere through their preachers, bureaucrats, and the warrior nuns from the Weeping Matriarchy.</p><p>The Chelebs-Menau family shines like a mighty sun across the dockyards in the Icon City from their floating palace high above the Intrapelagic Sea. In recent years, Chelebs have formed strong ties to the Zenithian Hegemony, and rumors whisper about a coming marriage between the builder masters and one of the purest and most exalted Hegemony families, which would create a blood bond across the whole Horizon.<br />The Weeping Matriarchy is an alliance of convents that are responsible for most of the Church’s security on Mira and Antmira. The Triumvirate of Sisters, appointed for life, controls the Matriarchy.</p><p>Okra Darma is the closest thing to the Syndicate the Mirans have – a criminal network that lives off robberies and gullible or frightened pilgrims visiting the Icon City. Okra Darma’s headquarters are hidden in the deep ravines on distant Menau, but their presence in the Icon City is anything but discreet.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ON GRAVITRON WINGS</h5><p>In the Docks quarter in the Icon City and in the foundries on Antmira, arms production is skyrocketing. The same is supposedly true for the Chelebs yards following the Vaarnathar comet in the Menau system. Why the Chelebs family is stockpiling arms is unknown. Agents from everywhere in the Horizon are drawn like flies to honey to Mira to find out what is going on.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE MIRAN DHOL</h5><p>The Miran dhol is named after the countless wild dogs that roam around the slums of the Icon City. The dhol is a small gravcraft used for transportation by both rich and poor in the cities on Mira. The fact that Chelebs and other smaller dockyards on the planet are capable of producing light, robust grav projectors is what makes the dhol so common. The dhol is usually shaped like a small boat and decorated with Icon eyes to ensure good fortunes for the skipper.</p></div><h4>NOTHING BUT TEMPLES</h4><p>”Wherever you go on Mira, you can always bow to the Icons” is a common pilgrim saying, denoting the constant presence of religious architecture on the planet, from monuments and prophet’s groves to prayer schools, monasteries, and Icon churches. The faith is a big part of everyday life, and all Mirans know the nine sacred rites from an early age. Alms-giving, prayer, and pilgrimage are considered the most important of the nine rites. Giving alms to beggars, temples or pilgrims is something an ordinary Miran does daily.</p><h4>PILGRIM TRAILS</h4><p>Mira and Menau are crisscrossed by pilgrim trails, paths, channels, and all manner of vehicles. Slowly the pilgrims travel across the holy lands. Neither pilgrims nor Mirans can see the point in rushing – the voyage is often a goal in itself. If speed is required, there is usually an available dhol nearby, and those too frail to walk can ride dromedons on Mira or the wooly, grip-hoofed cria on Menau.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE ENSNARER</h4><p>A common myth in the whole system is that of the Ensnarer, or Yal-Shir, who is said to seduce and prey on unworthy pilgrims. The more obscure or sparsely travelled a trail is, the more ”active” the Ensnarer is. Several pilgrim groups disappear every year on the Yadaman trail between the Icon City and the Valley of Monuments, something that neither private mercenaries nor the Matriarchy have been able to stop.</p></div><h4>THE GRAVITON WIND</h4><p>A curious phenomenon that neither the geonics of the Foundation nor Mira’s monastery scientists have been able to explain is the so-called graviton wind, or ”invisible veil”, sweeping across the mountains on distant Menau. It is as if the gravity in some places on Menau is fluctuating, not unlike in the gravitational pools that exist in Rimward Reaches. In certain areas gravity is non-existent, or even worse, suddenly increased manifold, which carries possibly lethal consequences.</p><p></p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/mira_torrdocka.webp\" /></div><br /><p class=\"centerJournalText\"> Blessing new graviton projectors in the Docks of the Icon City.</p><p></p><h1>THE ICON CITY</h1><hr /><p>The hub of the Mira system is the Icon City, founded in honor of the Icons. The location chosen, on the beaches of the Intrapelagic Sea, is said to remind one of a sun-kissed coastline on long lost Ardha, mankind’s first home. The three hills colonized by the first settlers have become the Icon City’s three districts of today: the Temple City, the Brick City, and the Docks, today called Chelebs City.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE DAY OF FLOWERS</h5><p>The planet Mira is widely known for its exotic flowers, held in high regard all the way from the Monolith to the dars of Dabaran. The annual celebration of the Day of Flowers is a legacy from the early colonists’ fertility cult, adapted to the Miran environment and seasons. During the weeks leading up to the feast, the Mirans travel into the wilderness to pick the most beautiful flowers that can be found on the savannah, in the silk forests or in the rainforests. In the final days before the celebration, buildings, dhols and even spaceships are decorated with flowers and wreaths. During the Night of Flowers, many new Mirans are conceived.</p></div><h4>MONASTICISM</h4><p>The monasteries in the Icon City are the center of all higher education in the system, which means that all of Mira’s rulers and bureaucrats have been novices in a monastery at some point. This should not suggest that the Miran states are more religious than others, however – the relationship to the Icons is kept cool and their aid is more or less taken for granted.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE TEMPLAR GUARD</h5><p>A special group outside of the formal control of the Church is the Templar Guard, an ancient order dating back to the days of the first colonists. The Templars regard it as their calling to guard the pilgrims, their paths, and the distant monasteries. Templar guards shave their heads and always wear the symbol of the Judge, either as a tattoo or on their clothes.</p><h4>THE TEMPLE CITY</h4><p>The Temple City stands out from the rest of the Icon City by breaking the laws of nature – parts of it are floating in the air, constructed on grav platforms. The churches, temples, prayer schools, and pagodas in the city below all stretch towards Huraba’s Blessing, that magical island in the sky, where the Church’s headquarters and the Herat council are located. The air in the Temple City is always full of tolling bells, prayer calls, and the hoarse voices of prophets.</p><p>Huraba’s blessing is home to the gigantic Icon Dome. With its blue-domed ceiling and the eight prayer towers posed as sentinels around it, the Dome has become the symbol of the Icon City. It descends to the Icon Tower below once a day to pick up the expectant pilgrims and dignitaries queuing to visit the floating island.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/atlas/mira5.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE DHOL WATCH</h5><p>Several guard posts on gravs circle Huraba’s blessing like crickets around a light flower. They are collectively known as the dhol watch, and each platform is a beautifully designed building containing weapons systems and strong force shields, at least according to the stories.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE WATCHFUL STATUES</h5><p>There are two imposing statues on the Pilgrim Plaza, depicting the Judge and the Dancer. An odd feature on the Dancer statue is an extra, third arm.</p><h4>THE DOCKS</h4><p>The Docks cover the hill closest to the sea. The buildings here are a blend of the reddish brown facades of the Brick City and more luxurious styles echoing temples or churches. The Docks are part seaport and part spaceport. Big, interatmospheric free traders and courier ships share the piers with land and sea gravs. The Docks are the heart of the city’s commerce, containing the huge trader souk where the Free League has established a presence. The souk, where all wholesale trade in silks, bamboo, grain and textiles takes place, gradually turns into the Icon City bazaar that covers the area between the Docks and the slopes of the Brick and Temple Cities.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"6dgPkycCI5hkdUKK","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376264771,"modifiedTime":1680376264771,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"hVYGrNqG6KwmonsB","sort":0,"_id":"w1K2nsaq02KUcubh"}

All but one of these cults, the Circle of Seekers, are dead today but their religious practices have been all but abandoned by the general population. Instead, the Church of the Icons has become the dominant religious faction. They are the Horizon’s youngest faction, and have grown strong through collecting, canonizing and institutionalizing the wide, sprawling faith that has existed in the Horizon for centuries. During a live Bulletin broadcast in CC 49, the nine sacred rites were put in writing in the Icon City on Mira, where the Church originally grew into a faction to begin with, during the darkness of the Long Night after the end of the war. A ruling matriarch and patriarch, assisted by an assembly of clergy, head the new faction. Today, the Seekers, whose presence was also strong on Mira, have been marginalized, looked upon as wise ascetics and prophets rather than actual figures of power within the faction.</p><p>The key difference between the Church’s doctrine and the Iconic folklore is that the faction denies the duality of the Icons’ temperaments and vengefulness. Instead, the Church preaches that evil exists within humans themselves, and that it is released when the Dark between the Stars enters someone’s life.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/IkonernasKyrk_fraktion.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CIRCLE OF SEEKERS</h5><p>The Circle of Seekers remain, but are the strongest on Sadaal, on Mira and her sister systems, and on Dabaran, where they have both the Temple of the Circle and a monastery school in Lotus, the holy city. The Seeker title is only awarded someone upon initiation into one of their monasteries, which are always shaped like circles. It is said that the Seekers possess the same mystical powers as those afflicted with the mystic’s disease, but that they are in full control of them.</p><p>The Seekers have a reputation for being skillful negotiators. They have often been called upon to end bitter conflicts, such as the Geselem riots on Algol and in the aftermath of the bloody massacre on the Moon of Menkar. Apart from this, the Seekers generally keep a low profile. On Coriolis and in other places, they run meditative stone gardens where believers and Seekers can come to find peace.<br />The Circle of Seekers remain, but are the strongest on Sadaal, on Mira and her sister systems, and on Dabaran, where they have both the Temple of the Circle and a monastery school in Lotus, the holy city.

Missionary expeditions depart regularly from the core systems out to the star arms, often carrying both missionaries and Seekers.</p><p>The most famous member of the Church is not the matriarch or the patriarch as one might expect, but the council member Wasimah Umm, a former Seeker turned Arch Herat. She has openly declared her views on many difficult questions of morality and ontology, the latest one being the intense debate about whether humanites have souls or not. Aside from Wasimah, the prophet Yesiel Marcos is a well-known face as he frequently appears on the morning shows of the Bulletin with a loud opinion on the “the Blight” and its impact on the Horizon. The father of the mission, Sharif Afta on Coriolis, has initiated the most missionary expeditions, and just recently came back alive from the disaster at Taoan.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> TALISMANS</h5><p>The faithful often carry a talisman representing their favorite Icon, something the Church has been trying to change, instead encouraging believers to carry a silver sideways eight, the symbol of the Church. The sideways eight symbolizes the eight visible Icons, with the empty spaces representing the Faceless One, but it is also the symbol of infinity in Dabaran mathematics.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"dhMzsBEnhaOMK7wO","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266412,"modifiedTime":1680376266412,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"Qwq4L7vLcf6RnHMg","sort":0,"_id":"w6HJ3oW0rV1S3vO2"}

The planet is known for its heavy industry, deep mines, vast wastelands and draconian faction- and Consortium-affiliated rulers. The industrial expansion has taken its toll on both the planet and its inhabitants, leaving the people divided between company loyalists and rebels.</p><p>Algol is a trinary system containing the stars Algol, Persei and Rhaas. Algol and Persei circle each other in a passionate dance, while Rhaas, the forgotten lover, watches from far away. As the stars are white, only Algol-Persei space contains habitable worlds: Yavan, Algol, Ermenu and Taus. A few worlds orbit the distant Rhaas, but house only a handful of mining colonies.</p><h4>CHILDREN OF THE DEMON STAR</h4><p>Across the Horizon, Algol’s reputation reflects its unspoken name: ”The Demon Star”. It is thought to be a haunted place only visited by the desperate and the greedy. The first colonists were likely aware of the stories, but ignored the system’s bad reputation to exploit its rich concentration of metals and minerals, and settled in the temperate belts on the planet Algol. When the Portal Wars raged across the Horizon, Algol was hit hard. Many cities were destroyed during a campaign of orbital bombardments remembered today as the ”Year of the Flaming Tears”. The arrival of the Zenithians revitalized the wounded world.</p><p>Algol is the hub of the system and most people today, city dwellers and rebels alike, still live in its two temperate belts. Old and newer cities like Yasul, Akhandar-O-Sharif, Belem and Yousfana crowd together, surrounded by wasteland on all sides. Colonies and mines exist across the entire planet, and are common in the whole system, on moons and asteroids as well as in the big debris cloud belt.</p><h4>THE CONSORTIUM AND THE REBELS</h4><p>The Consortium is the largest faction on Algol. With birr, grav cranes and vulcan might, the companies seized control of the ruined cities and began extracting the natural riches. The infrastructure was repaired and expanded, but vulgar displays of wealth next to growing shantytowns has become the face of Consortium-ruled Algol. The Zenithian Hegemony has also invested in several of the planet’s cities, thanks to the Algolan diaspora in the shadow of the Monolith. All Algolans are not kneeling before their Zenithian overlords however – the brutal treatment of the planet and the population fuels resistance and revolt. The rebel groups keep to the remote highlands, the forests of the taiga, and the frozen deserts near the planet’s poles.</p><p>Life on Algol is tough – hard work in the factories in the cities or hard work in the mines and logging camps in the wilderness. But just as the two suns chase each other across the heavens, the toils of the day give way to the pleasures of the night. The entertainment districts in the cities are filled with courtesan houses, pit fights and grav racing – and things like kohôl, opor, arrash and Substance O, the latest drug, help the people forget their worries. The bleak countryside mirrors the hard lives of the population – wide-stretching gravel plains, empty tundra, high mountain ranges and deep, dark forests. Pioneers and prospecting companies defy the hostile landscapes to search for precious metals and ore veins, hoping for that one big find – as the saying goes: ”A miner in the morning can be a pasha by night”.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"qHyHXd6fIdPXVyL2","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376265120,"modifiedTime":1680376265120,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"mDsGqwfpJDJqm4Bu","sort":0,"_id":"wlx7Bh8vlGZyAbkz"}

They must now locate the palace of Leod dol-Quassar and find Jarja Dougha, the engineer responsible for inspecting the pods upon arrival at the palace. The PCs must infiltrate a banquet full of neo-Zenithian dignitaries, unimpressed hegemonists, wealthy Algolans, and networking Dabaran royalty.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CYCLADE</h5><p>If the PCs have been quick, you could let the banquet coincide with the Cyclade celebrations. If they have been slow on the other hand, the celebrations are almost over and life is returning to normal.</p><h4>THE SITUATION</h4><p>The last surviving stevedore has identified Leod dol-Quassar as the next person in the chain of secretive middlemen between the martyr cell on Coriolis and the stasis pods’ unknown final destination. The Dabaran nobleman has ties to the Syndicate, but his drive to be accepted into the Zenithian Hegemony is what really motivates him. The Birbasils secretly regard Leod’s dreams as a possibility to start doing business with the hegemonists and pretend not to notice his split allegiances. Leod’s slave-trading and smuggling have been lucrative, and he has made sure to always save his best merchandise for the more prominent Monolithean families. His grovelling toward the higher-ups is finally paying off, and a deal is being finalized regarding the betrothal of his oldest son Marok to Theda Din Hrama, the fifth daughter of Aedon, leader of the mighty Din Hrama clan. The arrival of a Zalosian assassin in Little Algol has Leod spooked however, and he has increased security around his palace in Dignitary City with both extra guards and hired mercenaries. The PCs must take this into account when trying to find a way inside the palace.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> QUID PRO QUO</h5><p>The PCs might be able to call in favors from people they have helped earlier in the campaign to get inside the palace, or to get an audience with Leod dol-Quassar. If they have ties to the Syndicate or helped the Birbasils in Baybasin, they can be added to the guest list. If they helped the Shaukar guerilla, the organization’s ties to Yjala Bakou can get them smuggled in through a staff entrance. The same goes for if they fought Nestera in the souk during the Only the Dead event above. Have the PCs test <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">culture</strong> to understand the intricate ties between Leod and the hegemonists, and <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">manipulation</strong> to introduce themselves properly to the local Syndicate representatives or the agents from the slummer brigade. A final option might be to contact judicator Akouba Kosha, who can help them get in through a service entrance by using her contacts in the Astûrban.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>The clues clearly indicate that the abducted mystics are being brought to Leod dol-Quassar’s palace and that is where the PCs finally find some of the pods and further details of the mysterious end customers. As the GM, start to reintroduce Akouba Kosha at this point in the scenario and present her as a trustworthy ally to the PCs. It is important that they believe her to be on their side as it makes her possible betrayal later in the scenario much more dramatic. At the end of Act II, the PCs should have the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>The Mystics</strong>: The stasis pods marked with black crosses are treated differently than the rest of the cargo. The prisoners are kept on ice and after the pods are inspected, they are sent to the Sul-Mahala, a grand palace in the Sultra marshes. The palace was flooded long ago after the collapse of Cataract 27 (see Act III).</li></ul><p>Depending on who the PCs interact with during the banquet, pieces of the following might also be revealed to them:</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/fest3.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>THE HEGEMONY’S BETRAYAL</h4><p>Behind the curtains, the marriage of Theda Din Hrama to Marok dol-Quassar has actually been orchestrated by ministers in the Cabinet of Thousands along with Lenove Astir, the Astûrban’s spy chief. Astûrban agents implied to Leod that a very beneficial marriage proposal might be coming his way if he accepted Salamah ach-Abaud’s contract. The Din Hramas are fully aware of Leod’s intentions while going forward with the betrothal, and intend to break off the engagement as soon as the martyr strike team has played its part in the Hegemony’s plans. As Aedon never intends to see the marriage contract fulfilled, the disdain he and his fellow hegemonists feel toward the “slummer prince” might shine through their polished facades in the small hours of the night as wine and narcotics begin to loosen the visitors’ tongues. Din Hrama’s bodyguards are part of the security detail for the party, but are only focused on the well-being of the Zenithian guests and won’t lift a finger to help Leod’s family or any of the other party-goers.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CARGO</h5><p>The stasis units are brought from Pier 58 to Jarja’s workshop in the palace basement.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspection</strong>: Jarja inspects the pods and their occupants carefully. Artyr’s payment from Salamah depends on her approval of the condition of the cargo. She is also in charge of the logistics of shipping the marked pods to the Sultra marshes, and has accompanied the shipments there on two occasions.</li><li><strong>The Cargo</strong>: Apart from the stasis pods, Tubra’s crew have also transported slave labor to the palace on several occasions to earn some extra birr. The slaves, as well as all white-marked pods, are separated from the black-marked units and kept by Leod as payment for his services.</li><li><strong>Frequency</strong>: There have in total been six deliveries of pods marked with black crosses made to Leod’s palace. The first four runs contained three pods each but the last two have been packed – eight and six mystics respectively – putting the sum total at twenty-six suspected mystics (not counting the Emissary). Around fifty Sogoi and thirteen people from Coriolis have also reached the palace, either to be sold in the markets or given as gifts to Zenithian families in the Monolith.</li><li><strong>Murders</strong>: Leod’s pallbearers – the workers used by Jarja to ship the pods to the marshes – have recently gone missing. Leod only knows that they are missing, but Jarja has heard that at least one of their bodies has been pulled up by fishermen on Lake Ytamara.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE EMISSARY</h5><p>Jarja is the only one still alive who knows about the special arrangements that surrounded one of the pods:</p><ul><li><strong>The Emissary</strong>: The last delivery, which was a few days before the Cyclade, contained special cargo. Jarja was called down to Pier 58 to inspect one of the pods there instead of at the palace. There were twelve stasis units at the warehouse when she arrived, of which eight were marked in black. The transparent lid of the pod in question was painted over and Jarja was only allowed to inspect it using her tabula. The pod’s coolant system had a back-up battery attached to it. Salamah’s orders to Artyr regarding the pod explicitly stated that it be shipped directly to the marshes, but the other pods were brought to the palace for a more thorough inspection as usual.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SECRET DEALS</h5><p>The PCs might also find out a little bit more about the history of the smuggling operation (below). Further details might also be revealed in Leod’s death scene, The Statesman’s Last Dance, or by speaking to Jarja if she accompanies the PCs to the Sultra marshes (see Act III).</p><ul><li><strong>The Deal</strong>: Jarja (or Leod, if appropriately motivated) can reveal that the deal regarding the stasis units has been struck with a Baybasin merchant, Artyr Gholâm, and his Coriolis associate, someone named Salamah ach-Abaud.</li><li><strong>The Martyr Warriors</strong>: Jarja and Leod believe that Salamah, the likely mastermind of the operation, is a smuggler akbar on Coriolis. They know that Artyr gets paid by Salamah’s representatives on Kua only after Jarja has reported the results of her cargo inspection.</li></ul><h4>LEOD DOL-QUASSAR’S PALACE</h4><p>Years of groveling at the feet of the Monolitheans have finally paid off – Leod is moving up in the world. The banquet he is about to throw, Alsirsah, is the formal acknowledgement of his son’s betrothal to a prominent Zenithian. Leod is under much pressure to present himself as a worthy father-in-law, both economically and socially, which has prompted a meticulous cleaning of the entire palace and many costly renovations. The new rugs have gold fringes, exotic plants fill his garden and clusters of hanging sugar globes illuminate the palace’s many dark rooms. The last shipment of delicacies has just arrived and an enormous red carpet with embroideries depicting the Zenithians’ blessed arrival into the Third Horizon – specially commissioned for the occasion – covers the steps by the main entrance.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ATRIUM</h5><p>Inside the front doors, visitors are greeted by courtesans and members of the house staff and escorted through a marble colonnade with tasteful floor mosaics. The hallway is dimly lit and the cracked walls are covered with large draperies. The party-goers are taken to the atrium, which the palace’s former owner spent a fortune on renovating – white marble walls and floors with inlaid Algolan calligraphy in gold. Eight fountains discreetly praising the Icons serve as natural hubs for mingling. An assortment of dates, exotic fruits, nuts, and refreshing beverages are served here – with servants ready to sample everything before the more paranoid guests partake. Shaded alcoves line the walls, occupied by important hegemonists reclining on divans, attended to by their own staff. In the middle of the atrium, a dance troupe dressed in swirling burras perform a tastefully modern take on Tempestuous, a classical religious masterpiece, in stark contrast to the statuesque household guards positioned around the room.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BANQUET HALL</h5><p>After some light refreshments in the atrium followed by Leod’s welcome speech, the golden gates to the banquet hall are opened. The hall is a grand courtyard lined with palm trees and flower beds. In the center, a fountain showing a stylized Monolith in black obsidian rises high into the air, with a miniature Covenant City in mother of pearl clinging to the base. Flowering vines climb the statue toward the high mosaic ceilings, through which the night sky and the distant lights of the actual Monolith can be seen. Leod’s worship of the Zenithians is almost embarrassingly evident.</p><p>A large open space at the other end of the hall holds several long tables. Bread sculptures, trays of fruit, and ice statues complete the dinner service, and servants in the shadows stand ready to bring the guests whatever they desire. On an elevated stage, tables and divans are especially prepared for the Din Hramas and dol-Quassars.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE KITCHENS</h5><p>Several discreet doors lead from the banquet hall to the staff corridors that connect it to the heart of the palace; the kitchens. The corridors are strictly guarded, and security only allows people dressed as either waiters or slaves through, plus members of the dol-Quassar family of course. Curious or lost guests who wander into the staff areas are kindly but firmly escorted back to the banquet hall. The corridors have simple draperies or panels covering the walls and are dimly lit by strip lights. By following the smell of cooking one can find one’s way to the kitchens, via detours to the preparation rooms where the food artists tend to the aesthetic side of the dishes before they are brought out to the guests. Here and there, alcoves for small Icon statues or altars can be found, now crammed full with boxes and sacks of imported foods and spices.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BASEMENT</h5><p>The service corridors also lead to the staff residential areas, from where spiral staircases lead down through storage rooms and wine cellars and eventually reach the basement. Deep underground, thick duralite beams support the enormous weight of the palace above. The corridors here are dark, damp, and smell of stale water and rotting seaweed. The Ramishah’s brown waters run underneath the palace, and an old loading dock allows for easy transportation of goods in and out. Jarja Dougha’s home and workshop are located near the docks (see the Jarja’s Workshop event below).</p><h4>NPCS</h4><p>If the PCs run into trouble during the banquet, it likely involves either the dol-Quassar household guards or a hegemonist party-goer’s security detail.</p><ul><li>@Actor[Household Guards and Mercenaries]</li><li>@Actor[Leod dol-Quassar]</li><li>@Actor[Jarja Dougha]</li><li>@Actor[Akouba Kosha 2]</li></ul><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>Few of the events below require DP to activate, but several of them contain opportunities for the GM to spend points to challenge the PCs further. The PCs may attempt to infiltrate the banquet in a number of ways, either via the main entrance – the The Red Carpet event – or through a service entrance, as described in Behind the Scenes. The events that take place inside the palace describe several different chains of events.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE RED CARPET</h5><p>Rows of armed guards surround the palace, dressed in red caftans and white turbans. Their Vulcan carbines are polished and shine in the light from the setting sun. A closer look does however reveal that the rest of their gear varies, and a trained soldier (with at least COMMAND 1) will immediately recognize the group as a mix of household guards and hired guns.<br />On the night of the banquet, the palace gates are opened. Braziers and sugar globes floating in bird baths illuminate the night. The red carpet leading up the stairs is packed with people – wealthy merchants with their families in tow next to hegemonists in palanquins surrounded by bodyguards in strict formation. Five guards and a bio scanner by the door make sure no uninvited guests are let in.</p><ul><li><strong>Outraged Guest</strong>: As the PCs make their way through the crowd, a commotion up ahead catches their attention. An outraged merchant walks up to the guards by the door, screaming angrily: “By the Judge’s mercy, I shan’t suffer such slander from the likes of you! Do you have any idea of who I am? Leod dol-Quassar’s third cousin – that’s who! Now let me in at once…”. A baton strike to the stomach cuts off the indignant trouble-maker mid-sentence and four strong hands quickly haul him away down some side steps toward the dark waters of the river.</li><li><strong>The Guest List</strong>: If any of the PCs have either the Faction standing: The Zenithian Hegemony talent or contacts within the Syndicate, their names can be added to the guest list and they are allowed in without problem. If they aren’t properly dressed however, they will be the focus of numerous muttered comments and head shakes by the other guests throughout the evening.</li><li><strong>Concealed Weapons</strong>: Guest list or not, if the PCs try to smuggle weapons into the banquet and are caught, they will be regarded as trespassers and treated accordingly. PCs who wish to push their luck must win an opposed infiltration vs observation test (as the guards have the bio scanner, they roll seven dice, and the normal bonus from a Small item is negated).</li><li><strong>Uninvited</strong>: If the PCs try to enter through the front door without invitations, the guards quickly lose their patience. The PCs are told to leave, and unless they do so immediately, the guards will use batons and handcuffs to escort the group away from the palace, back toward the Souk Habra.</li><li><strong>The Judicator Intervenes</strong>: If there is a fight between the PCs and the guards by the door, Akouba Kosha will try to step in and cool things down. She thanks the guards for their excellent sense of duty but says she can take it from here, escorting the PCs away from the crowds. She then helps the PCs get in through one of the service entrances (see Behind the Scenes below).</li></ul><p>At the cost of 2 DP, one or more of the PCs have accidently been erased from the guest list. The guards will quickly raise their voices and pull out the batons, but a demanding (–1) manipulation test can calm the situation, after which an additional scan reveals that the PCs in question belongs on the invitation list after all.</p><p>Cost: 0, 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> BEHIND THE SCENES</h5><p>Dignitary City is an exclusive community and attending Leod’s banquet is nothing but a dream if you lack the proper contacts or social status. Without the hard work of the many slaves and hands who carry the food trays, tend to the gardens, and wait at the tables however, there wouldn’t be much of a party to speak of. The palace staff live a quiet life in the shadows, sharing over-crowded dorms, grubby kitchens, and moldy bathrooms. Deliveries intended for the party are admitted through the many service entrances around the palace or arrive by water directly to the basement warehouses. In the days leading up to the banquet, an endless stream of carriers have shuttled back and forth from the Souk Habra or the black markets by the Marzu Khala spaceport to the palace. Even as the guests are starting to arrive, the last shipments of exotic beverages – Sadaalian honey, Dabaran highland wine, and juice made from Miran fruits – are still on their way. Leod has also hired extra security for the evening, bolstering the ranks of his household guards with a group of mercenaries.</p><ul><li><strong>Security</strong>: All cargo brought inside is inspected – two guards are posted at every entrance with an open line to Khalim al-Arim, the head slave in charge of all party purchases. Convincing the guards to let something in without them checking with Khalim first requires a successful manipulation test at –2. If the roll fails, the PCs are asked to leave, and more guards will arrive to arrest them if they refuse (see the At the Prince’s Mercy event below).</li><li><strong>The Judicator</strong>: Akouba Kosha keeps an eye on the PCs from a distance regardless of whether the group have contacted judge Kurahan by now or not. As the GM, you can have the judicator contact the PCs and help them get inside if they are struggling. Her status as a judicator will enable her to convince both suspicious guards and Khalim al-Arim that the PCs are special detectives brought in to neutralize the threat of the rumored assassin. This ruse won’t give the PCs full access to the palace, but might get them an audience with the paranoid Leod after the party is over. After helping the PCs get inside, Akouba enters through the front gates and mingles with the other guests.</li><li><strong>In the Shadows</strong>: Inside, the PCs can move relatively freely throughout the staff areas, but guards block their way down to the basement and keep them from taking part in the actual party. Listening from the shadows, they can vaguely make out the gist of Leod’s welcome speech.</li><li><strong>Disguises</strong>: If the PCs acquire waiter or entertainer disguises, they can move between the staff areas and the party unhindered. Getting the disguises requires either a manipulation test or the use of force, as well as an infiltration test to blend in properly (one test for the entire group is enough). Each indiscretion or breach of etiquette while in disguise will remove one six from their roll, and when no sixes remain, a guest will loudly challenge their professionalism and a group of guards will take them away for questioning.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BETROTHAL DANCE</h5><p>When all guests have arrived, Leod delivers his welcome speech and raises a cup to Aedon Din Hrama, his daughter Theda, and his own son Marok (see the box below).</p><ul><li><strong>The Hegemonists</strong>: If the PCs look around the crowd during the speech, they will spot several hegemonists talking and joking amongst themselves about Leod’s complete lack of honor. Some of them look uneasy when the Icons are mentioned, but proudly sip their wine when the Monolith or the Zenithian way of life is praised in the speech.</li><li><strong>The Gunsmith</strong>: The PCs might also spot Jarja Dougha among the guests. She is not formally dressed, nor does she appear to belong to the staff – her clothes are practical but discreet. She approaches Leod after his speech and they exchange a few words, after which she returns to the shadows. Later during the evening, she exits the party and heads down to her workshop.</li><li><strong>Tense Host</strong>: Jarja and Leod share an important feature – when not conversing with someone or entertaining the guests, they look nervously around the room and seem on edge.</li></ul><p>After the speech, a group of musicians begin to play and courtesans escort Marok and Theda to the center of the room. They perform a formal betrothal dance, kept far apart by a swirling sea of hired dancers to illustrate the distance between their aching hearts that will soon be over. The first dance of the Alsirsah is a prelude to the couple’s Dance of the Union, a traditional dance at their coming wedding symbolizing their melding into one.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP (Mandatory)</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/jarjaDougha_bkg.webp\" /></div><p></p><div class=\"blueheader\">ALSIRSAH</div><br />The Alsirsah is originally a Dabaran traditional feast where the families of the betrothed meet to finalize the terms of the wedding. The life bond concerns not only the happy couple but their families as well, and the Alsirsah marks the end of an often lengthy period of negotiations over the two sides’ respective duties toward one another. The party is usually thrown by the family who marries upward, to show that they are worthy of the coming union.<p></p><p>During the banquet, Leod makes a welcome speech praising both the Din Hramas and the other guests – they will act as witnesses when the final contract is signed, making their opinions of the host very important.</p><p><em>“Honored guests and friends, I welcome you with all my heart to the Alsirsah. Tonight, we celebrate the union of the dol-Quassars and the noble Din Hramas, paragons of Zenithian light and wisdom, whom we have to thank for opening our eyes to a new Horizon.</em></p><p><em>Marok dol-Quassar of the proud Dabaran blood – exalted Dabaran who stalwartly fought off the darkness during the Long Night! – seeks the hand of Theda Din Hrama, a child of Ardha, a bringer of light from humanity’s cradle.</em></p><p><em>Honored guests, today is a proud day. May the Icons hear us as we raise our glasses toward the Monolith and pray for their blessing of this blood bond. May they guide us to honor our history and welcome the future.</em></p><p><em>Dearest of friends, may your cups never run dry, your plates never be empty and your spirits lose themselves in music and dance – may this Alsirsah be a fond memory for all of us until She the most Merciful comes to grace us with her slumber. May this day mark the birth of a brighter tomorrow.”</em></p><p>– Leod dol-Quassar, Dabaran Nobleman</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LADY IN RED</h5><p>If the PCs haven’t met judicator Akouba Kosha in this scenario yet, she will approach them during the banquet. It doesn’t matter if the PCs are there as guests or disguised as staff. One of them will suddenly bump into her and meet her fiery eyes or spot a group of guests parting as a woman in a red dress heads across the floor straight toward them. She pulls them aside and informs them that judge Kurahan has sent her to guarantee their safety and help them with their investigation.</p><ul><li><strong>Coriolis</strong>: If this is the first time since the end of In the Wake of the Martyr that the PCs have met someone from Coriolis, Akouba will update them on the current state of affairs. The Order of the Pariah’s cathedral cruisers Nimbus and Burana have conducted weapons tests, and the Cyclade celebrations have been plagued by riots. The disappearance of the Emissary has the Council on edge and accusations of incompetence and sloppy security have shaken the Consortium. Legion cruiser Sandrif and a flotilla of torpedo ships have taken up positions around the Kua system’s portal station as a show of force.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LOOSE LIPS</h5><p>The PCs spot a group of neo-Zenithians sitting around Marok dol-Quassar’s table, complimenting him for the grand party and toasting in his honor. It is getting late and spirits are high. They give him wine and stuff a hookah for him, but a closer look reveals shady intentions behind their smiles. The wine in Marok’s cup comes from one of the guest’s private cooler and there is a faint smell of opor oil in the air.</p><ul><li><strong>Blood Purity</strong>: As the drugs kick in, the group laugh at Marok’s ramblings and some of them spit demonstratively on the floor while making scornful remarks about how the Din Hramas won’t go through with the wedding. No hegemonist bloodline would ever dream of marrying into a clan of degenerate Firstcomes. They theorize amongst themselves about the motivations for the union, and agree that Leod is either blackmailing a high-ranking Din Hrama family member, or that the Cabinet of Thousands have plans that for now require the help of the smuggler prince. In any case, they find the prospect of the Din Hramas honoring the marriage contract laughable.</li></ul><p>At the cost of 1 DP, you can have the group spot the PCs eavesdropping. They will loudly accuse the PCs of making threatening comments about their families and signal their bodyguards to remove them from the party. At the cost of 1 additional DP, the bodyguards take the PCs to the atrium and rough them up a bit (a couple of baton strikes and punches for a PC of your choice). A successful manipulation test by a PC with a high Reputation score can calm the situation down, but if the PCs try to defend Marok’s honor, the household guards will be alerted to the commotion and cause a scene. Alternatively, have Akouba Kosha intervene before things get out of hand.</p><p>Cost: 0, 1–2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> UNDER THE JACKBOOT</h5><p>On the dance floor, a member of the Din Hrama party bumps into one of the waiters who drops a bottle of wine on the floor. The hegemonist’s djellaba darkens with stains, and as the waiter bends down to pick up the shards of glass from the floor, a foot stamps down hard on his hand, further shattering the glass underneath his palm. The bleeding waiter desperately tries to get the foot off his hand, but the Zenithian alerts some nearby guards and accuses the waiter of assaulting a guest. The guards brusquely shove the waiter away toward an entrance to the staff corridors.</p><p>Cost: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AN AUDIENCE WITH THE PRINCE</h5><p>The PCs have two ways of getting a private meeting with Leod – either by having their names on the guest list and politely asking to see the host later in the evening, or by posing as Akouba Kosha’s aides, in which case the spooked prince will demand to see them. A discreet courtesan will approach the PCs at some point during the evening, and ask the PCs to follow them to the atrium. A sharp-eyed PC might spot guards discreetly surrounding them, but maintaining a respectful distance. Unless the PCs accept the invitation without hesitation, the guards will close in and rather roughly escort the PCs to the atrium. After a few uncomfortable minutes alone with the guards, Leod dol-Quassar arrives. See the A Chat with Leod box below.</p><p>Cost: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AT THE PRINCE’S MERCY</h5><p>The actions of the PCs during the evening of the banquet might have landed them in trouble. Their gear is seized and their hands and feet are tied. Guards drag them into a dark, empty room. Moonlight seeps in through a skylight, but a thick stained glass window makes escaping upward impossible. In the back of the room, there is a simple bed and an Algolan rug with a scrolling vine pattern in gold. Dark, ominous stains both on the carpet and on the cushions on the bed raises suspicions about the fate of previous visitors. A copper tray holds a pitcher of water and a plate of dates and grapes. If the PCs try to resist or break free, the guards will beat them up with their batons before leaving them and locking the heavy door from the outside. At the cost of 1 DP, the guards are in an especially foul mood, and beat one PC regardless of whether she resisted or not. In this case, choose the PC best equipped to take a beating – or the weakest one, for a darker turn of events. The party can still be heard in the distance, but no one seems to notice or care about the PCs regardless of how much noise they themselves cause. Many hours later, the door finally opens and Leod, dressed to the nines, enters, accompanied by eight of his guards. See the A Chat with Leod box below.</p><ul><li><strong>The judicator</strong>: After the audience, a guard escorts Akouba Kosha into the room, who exchanges a few words with the nobleman. Leod agrees to let the PCs go if they promise never to challenge his authority again.</li></ul><p>Cost: 0, 1 DP</p><p></p><div class=\"blueheader\">A CHAT WITH LEOD</div><br />Unless the PCs manage to charm or impress Leod, he won’t answer any of their questions. Resolve this using an opposed MANIPULATION roll, with Leod having much better leverage (see page 61 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[General Skills]). See the Important Facts section at the beginning of the scene for more information.<p></p><ul><li><strong>The Assassin</strong>: Leod is interested in anything the PCs can tell him about the recent killings in Little Algol. If they caused trouble during the banquet, he will accuse them of being in league with the killer.</li><li><strong>The Deal</strong>: If the PCs win Leod’s trust, he will reveal that he believes the assassin is coming for him because of a deal he struck a while back with one Salamah ach-Abaud, a smuggler on Coriolis who needed help shipping slaves through Little Algol. Artyr Ghôlam has been in charge of the retrieval of the merchandise from the jungle, and Hassam work crews have then transported the pods to Leod’s palace.</li><li><strong>Leod’s Compensation</strong>: Leod’s payment for his services was that he could keep any slaves and pods not marked for further delivery. His engineer Jarja inspected all pods that arrived and compiled a report for Leod, which he in turn relayed to Salamah ach-Abaud via an intermediary working at the Marzu Khala spaceport called Dara Hirsha.</li><li><strong>The End Destination</strong>: He points out that Jarja knows more about the end destination of the marked cargo than he does. She has been in charge of the logistics along with a trusted team of carriers – jokingly referred to by Leod as “pallbeareres” – who recently all went missing during a job in Little Algol. He knows that the cargo is taken to somewhere in the Sultra marshes, but didn’t inquire after more details as he was content with having a steady supply of slave labor to sell or gift to the Monlitheans. He is reluctant to let the PCs see Jarja, but will agree to a short meeting if they appear to be on his side.</li><li><strong>The Emissary</strong>: Leod knows nothing about the Emissary and is adamant that its disappearance is unrelated to his affairs. The Xenian ghost has absolutely not been in his palace.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> JARJA’S WORKSHOP</h5>@JournalEntry[The Workshop Scene]<p>A spiral staircase and two elevators lead down to the basement. Visitors are immediately greeted by a heavy odor of mold and rotting seaweed, inadequately masked by burning incense and dried fruit. The worn corridor ends at an anonymous door, beside which an alcove houses a wooden Dancer statue on a makeshift altar surrounded by little bowls of dried fruit and sticks of burning incense.<br />Jarja can be seen in the shadows during the first part of the banquet, but she quickly tires of the party and heads back downstairs. Four large rooms make up Jarja’s apartment/workshop. The lock on the door is not that advanced, and a successful data djinn or technology test can circumvent the security system, opening the door without setting off the alarm (see below). Jarja lives mainly in the first, sparsely furnished room – it holds a simple bed in an alcove in the wall, some worn rugs, a table, and a low divan, plus a modest kitchen unit in a corner and a few cupboards.<br />An open garage door from the first room connects to a larger hall with a crane on rails in the ceiling and high shelving lining the walls. In the back, another large door leads to a stone pier. One of Dignitary City’s many canals diverted from the Ramishah runs through a tunnel underneath the palace. The workshop room is packed full of empty stasis units. Eight metal cages in the far corner stand ready for the next group of thawed slaves. Vats of coolant liquid stacked on top of each other sit next to the cages, some of them leaking their corrosive content onto the floor.<br />◆ Frozen Corpses: Two of the stasis units are active, humming faintly. An easy (+1) medicurgy or technology test reveals that the people inside are dead. The pods have been damaged during transport, with fatal interruptions to the stasis cycle as a consequence. One of the pods has white markings, the other black. The corpse in the black-marked pod is twisted in quiet agony and frozen fingers have clawed in vain against the lid. Loose objects and pieces of clothing also seem to have attempted escape and are frozen to the lid in a strange manner (the deceased mystic inside was telekinetic).<br />◆ The Tabula: There is a tabula on a workbench nearby. It is locked and requires a successful data djinn test to open. It contains miscellaneous notes about stasis units and spare part orders as well as a manifest listing all pods that have passed through the palace. The manifest lists twenty-five pods with black markings (Jarja didn’t register the Emissary), of which six have been classified as “damaged in transit”. Of the thirteen white-marked pods that are included in the manifest, four show as damaged (one of them is the young slave the PCs may have met in the Souk Habra earlier). The manifest also states that fifty-two Sogoi slaves have been delivered from Artyr to Leod as compensation for the damaged goods.<br />◆ Nar’sh – the Prisoner: The cages are simple constructions made from welded-together steel rods. The doors have simple code locks and the narrow space inside is just enough for a bed and a bucket. One of the cages contains a nekatra, gnawing desperately on a bone. Torn clothing and more pieces of bone in the cage suggests that the prisoner is chewing on the remains of former cellmates – three of them to be exact, which a successful medicurgy test can reveal. The nekatra is famished and has been treated very cruelly by Leod’s people for many segments. She cannot talk and is very scared and aggressive. A critical success on a manipulation test is required to make her trust the PCs, but if they also give her food and dress her infected wounds (medicurgy), she actually becomes rather attached to the group. She manages to convey to the PCs that her name is Nar’sh. Use the @Actor[Nekatra] stats from page 317 of the Coriolis core rulebook, but in her current conditon, Nar’sh has only 1 MP and 4 HP. Her claws have been surgically removed and her paws are scarred and twisted. At the cost of 2 DP, you can have Nar’sh attack the PCs when they let her out, even if she first appeared calm.</p><p>Next to the open garage door to the main workshop, a second door leads to a storage room for spare parts that also contains a toilet and shower. A PC who passes a TECHNOLOGY test can scavenge D6 ordinary spare parts here. A small door behind a shelf leads to the last room, Jarja’s private, smaller workshop. The workbenches in here are covered in gun parts, ammunition, and tabulas with schematics. A gun locker and a high shelf in a corner display Jarja’s finished projects, waiting to be sold by Leod, but she keeps much of what she builds secret from her master (see below).</p><ul><li><strong>The Gunsmith</strong>: If Jarja is home, she can be found in her private workshop, hunched over her latest project. She works on a Vulcan stock in a metal lathe while glancing at a tabula and will only notice the PCs when they enter the room. She quickly realizes that fighting her way out isn’t an option, and will try to ascertain what the PCs want instead, in the hopes that they will let her go if she helps them out. Unless the PCs pass a manipulation test however, she will lie and look for an opportunity to escape. If they achieve a critical success, Jarja realizes that the PCs are her best shot at escaping her indentured servitude under Leod’s cruel reign and will trade all her knowledge about the smuggling operation for safe passage out of the palace (see the Important Facts section above). As the GM, you could also decide that Jarja is out when the PCs search her workshop, instead introducing her during the audience with Leod or in the next scene, The Statesman’s Last Dance.</li><li><strong>The Gun Locker</strong>: The room contains 3D6 Vulcan reloads – that look very much like the special ammunition used during the attack on the Emissary’s residence – and a gun locker. The locker is locked and very hard to force open. If Jarja is convinced of the PCs’ noble intentions, she will open it for them, but opening it without her help requires passing both a normal science test and a difficult (–2) data djinn test. The locker contains a Vulcan carbine equivalent of a @Item[Legionnaire carbine Dayal-3] (see page 124 of the Coriolis core rulebook), two Vulcan crickets, a smoke grenade and some important new leads (see below).</li><li><strong>The Smuggler</strong>: The gun locker holds a file containing the contact information of a smuggler in Little Algol called Dara Hirsha. Dara is a Sadaalian mercenary turned smuggler using old connections within the Lama gang on Coriolis to ship contraband camouflaged as medical supplies onto the station. The file also contains an order placed by Salamah ach-Abaud for ten Vulcan carbines, four protective vests, and several cases of special ammunition, signed as delivered to Coriolis about a segment ago. A complementary order for more ammunition and an assortment of tools was placed and delivered about a week later. Jarja has kept her dealings with Salamah secret from Leod, hoping to put aside enough money to be able to escape the palace at some point in the future.</li></ul><p>At the cost of 2 DP, Jarja has rigged her home with a silent alarm that goes off as the PCs enter even if they passed the test to open the door (if they failed, the alarm goes off without it costing you the DP). After a few minutes, four guards storm the workshop and the risk of a firefight is high. If the PCs are defeated or give up, they are brought upstairs in chains (see the At the Prince’s Mercy event).</p><p>Cost: 0, 2 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"AvV0jouoqlcHGVrx","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695296496,"modifiedTime":1682695296496,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"CzUEdkaKoI0pi4si","sort":0,"_id":"xUT8XVGxJargw0JL"}

{"name":"The Church of the Icons","flags":{"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true},"coriolis-corerules":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/10 - The People of the Horizon","noteRef":""},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-corerules.journalentry.1e17f3412c8b7275"}},"pages":[{"name":"The Church of the Icons","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>The rise of the Church of the Icons has changed the way the Icons are worshipped in the Horizon. Through the canonizing of the holy scriptures and the Declaration of Sacred Rites, the faith has been formalized in a way it never was before. The dark aspects of the Icons have officially been cast out, but still remain among most of the general public. From Mira, Coriolis and Dabaran, the matriarchs and patriarchs rule the Church, living in life bonds with one another but without children, as they are firmly devoted to the Icons only. The pinnacles of the faith are the sacred rites and they are equally important to all believers, although local customs may weigh in depending on system, culture and clan.</p><h4>THE SACRED RITES</h4><p>There are nine sacred rites, just like there are nine Icons, but many hold prayer and blessing as the two most important ones. The Order has their own version of the blessing, incorporating elements of flagellation and martyrdom.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  THE MISSION</h5><p>The mission is what separates the new faith from the old ways found on Mira, Zalos, and Sadaal. The mission rite requires a believer to leave her home and travel the Horizon for one segment, spreading the faith. Low-ranking preachers or prophets are often sent to the fringes of civilization to serve in a chapel or monastery there, sometimes for a whole triad.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE LIFE BOND</h5><p>At some point during one’s lifetime, one should form a life bond with someone of the same or opposite gender. The orthodox believers meant that the purpose of the life bond was to procreate, but this is possible regardless of gender in the Third Horizon, thanks to advanced technology such as nutri-wombs and cloning. Divorce is forbidden. Widows and widowers are supposed to live out the rest of their lives in mourning.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CREED</h5><p>Once a year, during the Cyclade, a believer should openly declare her faith by reciting the creed together with others in a temple.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE BLESSING</h5><p>Blessing one’s home, ship, shop, or other business is done by all believers. The blessing is especially important before going traveling or at the start of a new year or cycle.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE FAST</h5><p>During the segment of the Merchant, between dawn and dusk – during the morning and day watch – the faithful must abstain from food and drink. Children and the sick are excused from fasting. The purpose of the fast is to cleanse body and soul, but also to serve as a reminder of material necessity.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE CONFESSION</h5><p>To purify the mind, the faithful should confess their sins once per segment, preferably to an anointed priest or priestess, but a missionary, preacher, or pilgrim could also do. No believer is free from mistakes and lies, which makes the confession a very important sacrament.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE PILGRIMAGE</h5><p>There are two holy sites that the faithful should visit at least once during their lives – the Dome of the Icons on Coriolis and the Icon City on Mira. Many regard the temple city Lotus on Dabaran as an even holier site and the Church has come under pressure to include Lotus in the pilgrimage.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ALMS-GIVING</h5><p>Giving alms to the poor pleases the Icons and should be done once per segment. A ninth of one’s income is to be given away. The alms-giving is considered one of the most important sacred rites on Mira.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE PRAYER</h5><p>The faithful should pray twice a day, at dawn and dusk. This rule can be broken if the believer’s life is in danger or for other special occasions. It is common across the Horizon for people to gather at prayer plazas and pray together. The praying person should be on her knees, and preferably on a prayer rug.</p><h4>CHAPELS AND HOLY SITES</h4><p>The Horizon is full of chapels, temples, Icon walls, and sculptures. Much of the worship takes place at these sites, in homes, or at spiritual focal points such as the Lotus Rock on Dabaran or the Holy Grove in Alchai. Pilgrims flock to three major holy sites: the Dome of the Icons on Coriolis, the Icon City on Mira, and Lotus on Dabaran. The Crater Dome on Algol is smaller and mainly visited by local pilgrims, but the news of its holiness is spreading.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">THE ICON CHAPEL</div><p>The typical chapel is an open, octagonal building with eight or nine alcoves in a large room. The alcoves contain statues of all the Icons except the Faceless One. The chapels usually have high ceilings, supported by a pillar in each alcove, and it is common that they have an opening in the ceiling where the sun or the stars can be seen. The local priest or preacher will usually live in a building adjacent to the chapel, although only missionaries or pilgrims tend to very remote sites. No matter how small the dome, chapel  or temple is, they always contain a common room where the faithful can relax and spend time together, with food, chai, hookahs, or just a few chairs. Many chapels also have fountains or, in the Algolan fashion, raked stone gardens. Special courtesan temples exist on Mira where more intimate acts are allowed, something the modern parts of the Church want to ban.</p><h4>ICON WALLS AND RELIQUARIES</h4><p>In places where a chapel cannot be built for some reason, you will commonly find Icon walls instead. They are simple brick walls with alcoves for the Icon statues. Icon walls are often built on holy sites, such as on top of the remnants or catacombs of an earlier temple. Some of the older temples have vast networks of catacombs underneath them where holy bones are buried. These catacombs may also contain hidden reliquaries where precious gift or offerings are kept, usually under guard by preachers, warrior monks, or just the watchful eyes of the Icons. On ships and stations, there may not always be room for a proper chapel, but there is almost always a prayer room or an Icon wall onboard. Many believers would not set foot on a ship that didn’t have some form of space dedicated to the Icons, which makes such ships rare. In the fifth L-point above Melik lies the temple of Horizon’s End, which its proprietors claim to be unique in all the Horizon: the visiting pilgrims can meditate and pray with only an ED field between them and empty space, under the flames of the Melik sun.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 10.1 SACRED RITES ACCORDING TO THE CHURCH OF THE ICONS</h4><table><thead><tr><th>SACRED RITE</th><th>ICON</th><th>FREQUENCY</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The Mission</td><td>The Messenger</td><td>Once in life, during at least one segment.</td></tr><tr><td>The Life Bond</td><td>The Dancer</td><td>Once in life.</td></tr><tr><td>The Creed</td><td>The Gambler</td><td>Each year during the Cyclade.</td></tr><tr><td>The Blessing</td><td>The Deckhand</td><td>Each year during the Cyclade.</td></tr><tr><td>The Fast</td><td>The Merchant</td><td>From dawn to dusk during the segment of the Merchant.</td></tr><tr><td>The Confession</td><td>The Judge</td><td>Each segment.</td></tr><tr><td>The Pilgrimage</td><td>The Traveler</td><td>Once in life.</td></tr><tr><td>The Alms-giving</td><td>The Lady of Tears</td><td>Each segment.</td></tr><tr><td>The Prayer</td><td>The Faceless One</td><td>Twice daily.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch10/kampanj_s167.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>THE CATACOMBS OF ZARANDJ</h5><p>The Zarandji catacombs on Dabaran are said to contain rich offerings made by the wealthy neighboring dars before the temple was destroyed in the Portal Wars. Many archaeologists and grave robbers have gone in search of the fabled riches but have come out empty-handed – if they were lucky enough to come out at all.</p></div><h4>SPIRITUALITY AND SCHISMS</h4><p>Despite the Church’s efforts, the Icon faith is not a uniform religion but filled with variations, deviations, and schisms. Common people regard the Icons as multifaceted and unpredictable, capable of both blessings and curses. This is firmly denied by the Church of the Icons through all the teachings of their missionaries, preachers, and prophets – nothing bad can come from the Icons, mankind itself and the Dark between the Stars are the roots of evil. At present, there are two major schisms dividing the faith: the Emissary from Xene and Oikoumene as Nadjim.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE TROUBLESOME EMISSARY</h5><p>The ghosts from the gas giant Xene, often described as either spirits or spectral phenomena, have recently declared themselves the “emissaries” of Xene. There are officially five of them, but rumors claim that there are really nine altogether and that the Foundation and the Consortium are hiding the truth. One of the Emissaries has named itself the Judge incarnate, which the Order of the Pariah views as heresy since the Judge – in its Martyr aspect – is the only Icon they worship. The Order has put the Foundation and the Consortium under pressure to extradite the Emissary, threatening to send their antimatter armed warships to the Kua system.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> OIKOUMENE AS NADJIM</h5><p>In the last few cycles, a new subject has sparked debate among philosophers and preachers, especially in the Rimward Reach in the Kua system. The matter concerns whether or not humanites are the spiritual equals of base humans. The issue was first brought up when new colonists questioned the nomads’ religious rhetoric. The prophet Ndina addressed the issue in a sermon, and the five head preachers in the Rimward Reach were quick to outline new teachings for the nadjim, the humanites. An ecumenical assembly, Oikoumene as Nadjim, is being organized to establish that there is no spiritual difference between humanites and base humans. Invitations to the assembly have been sent out to knowledgeable preachers and prophets across the Horizon, as well as to the matriarch and patriarch of Mira. So far, there is no consensus on the matter.</p><h4>THE FAITH OF THE FACTIONS</h4><p>The religious practices of the factions differ greatly. The Firstcome factions are all dominated by religious and mystical ideas but in different forms. Two factions praise only one Icon – the Draconites who worship the Executioner, and the Order of the Pariah who bow only to the Martyr. There are even some different practices within the Church of the Icons, where the marginalized cult of the Circle of Seekers view the Icon faith as a rough but practical simplification of the great mystery of life, and that each Icon is its own way to enlightenment. The Zenithian factions distance themselves from the Icons, but not openly – for strategic reasons. An exception to this is the Foundation, which is in direct opposition to a worldview where the Icons have any power at all. Their hardline scientific convictions have put them on a collision course with the Order of the Pariah.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"dJKHFSkV07gn8b6T","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266392,"modifiedTime":1680376266392,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"xtRrUrJbjXHnyQy6"}

New types of simple but robust ships are being produced modularly, and then fitted for different purposes. Warships are built in only a few shipyards, and the larger ones are generally hundreds of years old, predating even the Portal Wars. All ships in the Third Horizon are divided into classes by their size, each class having its own set of game stats, as described in the adjacent boxed text.

Vulcan fire near weak spots in the outer hull may cause explosive decompression. The nekatra have been trained by the Legion to use this to their advantage and will try to find places where the enemy must limit their use of firearms. If the PCs manage to track the nekatra, they will likely find them near the outer hull, and the same goes for if they encounter them by chance. Only if the PCs actively remain in the inner regions of the ship will the hungry and desperate nekatra seek them out there.</p><p>As the GM, use the nekatra threat to put the players on edge, but they should have a fighting chance to defeat the beasts in combat. Depending on the combat prowess (especially in terms of close combat) and weaponry of your group (smuggled onboard, improvised, or taken from the bridge), you should tailor the nekatra encounter to make it dramatic, but not necessarily lethal – not for the whole group at least. Alternatively, the nekatra might try to negotiate with the PCs, or vice versa, but should this fail, they will begin attacking lone survivors until it becomes obvious that the PCs must see to the situation with force.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FACTS</h4><p>Depending on where the fight takes place, heavy weapons fire may lead to unintentional and unwanted consequences. By successfully testing science, the PCs can find a ‘safe’ place away from weak spots in the hull where they may use as much of their arsenal as they please. Another way to deal with the situation is to get into exos and then seek out the nekatra, possibly intentionally breaching the hull. There is a small chance that the encounter can be resolved without violence, however. The creatures are scared and, even under normal circumstances, less prone to calculated foresight than humans, but they want a way off the ship and know that this is beyond what they can accomplish on their own. The PCs can try to negotiate with the nekatra, but it will be difficult. To have a shot at all, they must either pass a culture test or have access to a @Item[Language Unit] (page 108 of the Coriolis core rulebook). They must then promise the nekatra a way off the ship and pass a manipulation test at –2 (without bonus dice from Reputation). If the test fails, the nekatra feel threatened and attack. If they pass, the nekatra stay out of their way but near the escape vessel until it is time to get out. If the PCs try to trick the nekatra and are found out, their retaliation will be merciless.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Mote med Nekatra6.webp\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>RISKING EXPLOSIVE DECOMPRESSION</h4><p>All shots fired near the outer hull that miss their targets risk breaching the integrity of the hull, leading to explosive decompression. Intentionally firing at a weak spot to vent a section of the ship is very easy (RANGED COMBAT +3). The hull has 3 HP and an armor rating of 6. The liner has two security systems in place to limit the effects of hull breaches – the breached section is immediately sealed off by rapidly closing bulkhead doors (in the same turn as the breach), and an ED field plugs the hole (two turns later). As Suleiman has a lot on his mind and isn’t quite his normal self, it may take longer for the security systems to activate in some cases. See page 99 of the Coriolis core rulebook @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat] for more information about explosive decompression.</p></div><h4>NPCS</h4><p>Below are descriptions of the nekatra and their abilities.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">ZHASAI, ALPHA FEMALE</div>@Actor[Zhasai, Alpha Female]<div class=\"blueheader\">NEKATRA</div>@Actor[Nekatra (Ghazali)]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/nekatra_strid_varelse.webp\" /></div><h4>EVENTS</h4><p>Below is a list of nekatra related events, to be used whenever you feel like it during Act II. The last two events take place after Act II. Use the nekatra to make the PCs feel like there are no safe places onboard the Ghazali.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> LURKING FEAR</h5><p>The PCs hear a screeching noise, like claws across a metal panel. The sound echoes and reverberates, making it hard to determine where it came from, but it is drawing nearer. The nekatra have caught the PCs’ scent and are on their trail. They communicate using wailing, hissing sounds. They stay out of sight until they see a good opportunity to strike. Have the PCs test observation to spot a shadow in the corner of their eye or smell a strange odor. Give them a good scare!<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> DEATHSTRIKE</h5><p>As the PCs are interacting with a group of other survivors (at the docks or while loading Sabetha Pour’s cargo for example), they hear a scream coming from nearby. The scream is suddenly cut off, and someone notices that a (minor, unimportant) NPC is missing. They find bloody tracks nearby and may test survival to track the nekatra back to their pack.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SHOW OF FORCE</h5><p>A young male attacks the PCs to show off. It chooses a strategically advantageous time and place, when the PCs are divided or off guard. He lunges at them from the shadows, attacking the largest individual in the group. If the beast is seriously injured, it retreats. A survival test allows the PCs to track it back to the pack.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ASSAULTING THE MEDLAB</h5><p>The entire nekatra pack attacks the PCs at the medlab (or wherever they have set up camp). They are desperate and try to kill as many survivors as possible, but will spare a single one whom they plan to threaten to help them escape the ship. If they encounter a unified opposition, they retreat and bide their time until the evacuation. Keep in mind that nekatra are very formidable opponents and limit their numbers to match the PCs’ combat skills.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> A FINAL ATTEMPT</h5><p>The remaining nekatra attack the PCs’ ship and try to make in onboard. They will spare a single person to pilot the ship out.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 2 DP</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> STOWAWAY</h5><p>A nekatra has managed to sneak onboard the PCs’ ship and is hiding in the cargo hold. Sooner or later, someone on the ship detects the unwanted guest, but it may not happen until they reach Hamurabi and the ship is searched by port inspector Asal Harub.<br /><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"rucqNvJoyEDuKedr","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376252487,"modifiedTime":1680376252487,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"W11hfVbJtZWbfYpM","sort":0,"_id":"ybbw1spSlvqqFNiD"}

The story begins in the steaming, hot jungles, continues into the Conglomerate, and ends at the foot of the Monolith.</h3><p><strong>The Kuan Connection</strong> is a scenario in three open acts where the PCs can choose many different paths toward their goal. Each act has a starting and ending scene, but just as in the Wake of the Martyr scenario, you are free to play the rest of the scenes in any order. The Kuan Connection should be played immediately after In the Wake of the Martyr.</p><h4>BACKGROUND</h4><p>The Warriors of the Holy Light and their samaritan allies quickly realized that it would be impossible to interrogate and examine all of their mystic prisoners onboard Coriolis, especially after the disappearance of the Emissary. They hired the help of Syndicate-affiliated slavers to set up a secret method of shipping their prisoners from the Cellar down to Kua using old escape pods. On the ground, the stasis pods are collected by smugglers working for shipping akbar Artyr Ghôlam and transported down the Ramishah river to the Conglomerate. When the pods arrive in Little Algol, they are inspected by smuggler prince dol-Quassar and sent to the Sultra marshes.</p><p>The ruined city of Sultra has been abandoned since the CC57 flood, which makes it a perfect location for all sorts of shady business. Gaddar-e-Abrar – a false preacher inserted into the martyr strike team by the Astûrban – helped the martyr warriors secure an abandoned Foundation hyper-sickness research facility and turn it into their base of operations. Prisoners who survive the perilous journey and make it to the marshes are interrogated, tortured, and executed – a fate that eventually also befalls the Emissary.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> POLITICAL SCHEMING</h5><p>Since it came out that the Order of the Pariah were responsible for the chaos on Coriolis, their diplomatic mission to the station has been under severe pressure. The Order has responded by flexing its muscles – the Bulletin recently reported that the two cathedral cruisers Nimbus and Burana have performed weapons tests of their enormous antimatter missile systems. The escalation is a key part in the Astûrban’s – or really the Nazareem’s Sacrifice’s – plans to provoke their old enemy into open war with the Legion and the Consortium.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>The three acts of The Kuan Connection are briefly summarized below.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 1 – LOST IN THE JUNGLE (PAGE 100)</h5><p>@JournalEntry[00 - Lost in the Jungle]<br />The first act takes place in the wilderness – in the hot, humid, and treacherous jungles of the Verkâna Ridge. The PCs' survival and negotiation skills will be tested as they follow in the footsteps of the Emissary’s kidnappers.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 2 – BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE ALGOL (PAGE 125)</h5><p>@JournalEntry[00 - Little Algol]<br />The second act begins when the adventures in the jungles are dealt with. The PCs enter the Conglomerate and continue to look for the Emissary, but an assassin sent by the Order of the Pariah gets in their way. Their investigation begins in the labyrinthine blocks of the Khabal docks and ends with a visit to the palace of the Dabaran noble dol-Quassar.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ACT 3 – THE SULTRA MARSHES (PAGE 155)</h5><p>@JournalEntry[00 - The Sultra Marshes]<br />In the third act, the PCs reach the sunken city of Sultra where the martyr strike team is keeping the Emissary prisoner in an abandoned Foundation installation. Here, the group experiences dreams and visions of the future of the Third Horizon.</p><h4>FACTIONS AND GROUPS</h4><p>Many different groups and factions struggle for power on Kua and in the jungles. In The Kuan Connection, the main faction involved is the Zenithian Hegemony through the Astûrban. Some of the smaller organizations include the Shaukar guerilla and the Nestera defense forces.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>MAJOR CHARACTERS</h4><p>The key characters in this scenario are divided between several different groups with agendas that all put them in the PCs' way. The central group is the smuggler ring hired by the martyr strike team:</p><ul><li><strong>@Actor[Artyr Gholâm]</strong> – shipping akbar and smuggler (page 117)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Ramses]</strong> – leader of the smuggler group Ramses' Jackals (page 104)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Tubra Ghutan]</strong> – foreman for Artyr’s operations in Little Algol (page 131)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Leod dol-Quassar]</strong> – Dabaran noble and smuggler living in Little Algol (page 142)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Jarja Dougha]</strong> – gun smith and engineer in the dol-Quassar slum palace (page 142)</li></ul><p>The martyrs of the strike team themselves are relatively absent from the story until the PCs close in on their base:</p><ul><li><strong>@Actor[Chabaun Kheml]</strong> – leader of the martyr strike team (page 175)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Ataia]</strong> – agent for the Order of the Pariah activated to clean up in Little Algol (page 132)</li><li><strong>Keziah-Ven</strong> – Vestal onboard The White Butterfly and agent for the Emperor of the First Horizon (page 170 @JournalEntry[03 - A Great Winged Shadow])</li></ul><p>OTHER CHARACTERS:<br />The Astûrban have agents in place to make sure the blame for the events on Kua and Coriolis falls on the martyr warriors and the Order:</p><ul><li><strong>@Actor[Gaddar-e-Abrar]</strong> – Astûrban agent inside The Warriors of the Holy Light (page 177)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Akouba Kosha 2]</strong> – Judicator and double agent for the Astûrban (page 143)</li></ul><p>A few characters of slightly less importance also feature in the scenario:</p><ul><li><strong>@Actor[Raquin Birbasil]</strong> – Syndicate representative in the jungle settlement of Baybasin (page 118)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Haquim] and @Actor[Aqueda]</strong> – scouts for the Shaukar guerilla at Verkâna Ridge (page 104)</li><li><strong>@Actor[Dali Osman]</strong> – officer in the Shaukar guerilla (page 119)</li></ul></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE ASTÛRBAN</h5><p>The Astûrban are behind the plot to vilify Zalos and the Order of the Pariah in order to create chaos on Coriolis. The Zenithian Hegemony is trying to increase tensions between the Consortium and the Order and use the uncertain political situation to seize the Coriolis station and spearhead a campaign for peace and stability. The Astûrban agents in the scenario are Gaddar-e-Abrar, the false prophet in the martyr strike team’s base in the Sultra (see Act III), and Akouba Kosha, a judicator working for judge Nigelia Kurahan. Kosha is sent to Kua to secure the allegiance (or silence) of dol-Quassar while at the same time making sure that the PCs' suspicions continue to focus on the Order and the martyr warriors (see Acts II and III).</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MARTYR Strike team</h5><p>The martyr strike team act mainly through intermediaries on Kua and will not interact with the PCs until they are closing in on their base. Their leader on Kua, Priot Chabaun Kheml, is responsible for the ground operations and it was on his orders that the cell on Coriolis acted. He will never give up any of this information however, not even under torture. Chabaun set up the whole operation via the leader of the cell on Coriolis, Salamah ach-Abaud, who in turn hired Artyr Gholâm and the Dabaran noble Leod dol-Quassar. The latter two therefore believe that the whole thing is run from Coriolis. Artyr’s job was to collect the pods and bring them to dol-Quassar, who was free to take as many of the non-mystic prisoners as he liked and use them for his own profit as long as he made sure all the marked mystic prisoners were shipped to a certain location in the Sultra marshes.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE DABARAN NOBLE</h5><p>Leod dol-Quassar is a Dabaran noble with considerable power in Little Algol. He has made his home in one of the abandoned marble palaces scattered around the Dignitary City islands. The palace looks as decrepit as the rest of the surrounding slums, but is a marvel of hegemonistic luxury on the inside. The smuggler prince’s dreams of becoming a Monolithean allowed him to be swayed by the sweet nothings of the Astûrban agents who hired him to work for the martyr warriors. The Order seems to be cleaning house however, and as Leod handles stress rather poorly, he is rapidly becoming a problem for his Astûrban employers.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SLAVERS</h5><p>The local smuggler group Ramses' Jackals has been hired by shipping akbar Artyr Gholâm to collect the pods the martyr warriors land on Verkâna Ridge. They load the pods on crawlers and take them to the jungle village of Baybasin, on the shores of the Ramishah delta. The Shaukar guerilla have noticed the smugglers' business and are starting to become a problem.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SHAUKAR GUERILLA</h5><p>The Shaukar guerilla is a revolutionary organization formed as a reaction to the factions' and the corporations' oppression of the Kuan peoples. They have taken up arms and fight against faction forces and paramilitary warbands in the southern provinces. The name of the guerilla derives from the man known as Shauk – “The hand who said no” – a worker who one day defied his foreman and walked out of his plantation. Shauk is described as a Qad hú-Gan, which is a Kuan term for a self-educated preacher who can recite the holy texts without having read them and who constantly hears the voices of the Icons. It is said that Shauk traveled extensively between the plantations, secretly teaching the workers to read and write and telling them about the hardships endured by all hands everywhere. The movement that grew around Shauk soon spawned the Shaukar guerilla, a group with sympathizers from all strata of society, although arguably mainly from the lower classes.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-emissarylost/images/03-kuan/gerillasoldater.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE SOGOI</h5><p>The Kuan jungles are home to the modern descendents of the planet’s original Firstcome settlers. The Sogoi tribes live in almost perfect harmony with nature, and have forsaken the comforts of civilization. Most Sogoi live in huts deep in the jungles, but some of the tribes are nomadic and roam the lush forests around the equator or travel along the waterways in the Ramishah delta. Their knowledge of local plants and game is vastly superior to that of the modern settlers. Ancient crafting and hunting traditions enable the tribes to live off the land in primitive affluence, eating well and dressing in beautiful, brightly colored clothing (SURVIVAL 5, automatic success in all basic jungle survival situations). The tribes are hard pressed by Kua’s mainstream society however, and many have either been enslaved by plantation owners or forced into employment under slavelike conditions. Many Sogoi can also be found working as scouts and soldiers in shady mercenary companies.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE NESTERA DEFENSE FORCES</h5><p>A low-intensity war is being fought in the Conglomerate between the hands and the Consortium companies, represented in Little Algol by the Nestera defense forces. The Nestera soldiers will become involved in the story if it interferes in the Little Algol conflict.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE VESTALS</h5><p>The CC61 incident in the Hamura system resulted in the loss of both the Ghazali line cruiser and a Legion destroyer named Zafirah when the portal from Hamura to Taoan released a massive burst of energy (which is further explored in the stand-alone scenario The Last Voyage of the Ghazali). The portal leading from Hamura to Taoan is now closed, but what no one in the Horizon knows is that the incident marked the return of the forces of the First Horizon into the cluster. For many years, the leaders of Ardha have sent their most trusted agents – the Vestals, high-ranking members of the imperial clergy, as well as mighty warriors – into the void to try to find a way into the Third Horizon, and at Taoan, they finally found one. The Vestals who made it through are now traveling around activating old sleeper cells of  Nazareem’s Sacrifice and infiltrating the factions to destabilize the Third Horizon. They usually stay hidden, but in this scenario, as it involves something as crucial to their plans as the abduction of an Emissary, they reveal themselves, arriving at Kua in their white, buterfly-shaped ship. The arrival of the Vestals is what connects Emissary Lost to the upcoming scenarios in the campaign.</p><h4>BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h4><p>Unlike In the <em>Wake of the Martyr</em>, The Kuan Connection will feature more action and conflicts. The PCs are chasing the missing mystics and must survive the dangers of the jungles, a rebel uprising, and street fighting in the Conglomerate. The final showdown features both the remaining members of the martyr strike team and a darkmorph spawned by the actions of the First Horizon agents. To keep the pace up, provide the PCs with a clear course to follow. The first scene (Blood on the Leaves) contains clues that will help the PCs find their way through the rest of the scenario.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PREPARATIONS</h5><p>By now, the PCs should be firmly invested in the hunt for the missing mystics and the kidnapped Emissary. Before you start this scenario, spend some time preparing the different antagonist groups featured in the story and make sure that there are more ways than the Vulcan method to resolve the conflicts ahead.</p><p>There are some investigative elements in the scenario, and the tips provided on page 14 of In the Wake of the Martyr @JournalEntry[Introduction] can be used here as well. Remember to help the players keep track of important details that their characters wouldn’t forget.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">ALTERNATIVE INTRODUCTION</div><p>The PCs might have opted for their own ship over the strike team’s drop pods at the end of the previous scenario. If they did, they will arrive much later than the cargo they are chasing, but the Icons are smiling on them – a terrible storm has ravaged Verkâna Ridge and the pods have not yet been collected. The Shaukar guerilla are on the warpath however, and will fire on the PCs on approach, either shoting them down or forcing them to land in the jungles. Regardless, they will be forced to undertake the long trek through the jungles described in Act I. Spare parts for their ship can only be found at the market in Baybasin (page 116 @JournalEntry[03 - On the Brink]). This might feel a bit forced, but it will give the PCs a chance to interact with the residents of the Ridge, which will affect later events in Little Algol. As the GM, you could of course skip this part, but be prepared to alter the rest of the scenario accordingly if you do.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"Xjj8PMn51rmICCRm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682695297520,"modifiedTime":1682695297520,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"eRFR6CN2Z4YBMV1L","sort":0,"_id":"yh41COFrfPKRdtCv"}

When they find that they aren’t alone, they are faced with the dilemma of whether or not they can (or want to) help save the others as well. A few of the other survivors also appear to have shady agendas of their own…</h3><p><strong>In the second</strong> act, the PCs will likely step up as leaders of the evacuation efforts. The medlab becomes their base of operations when organizing the escape.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p>After their conversation with Suleiman, the PCs have a better idea of what has happened, what threats they face, and what they must do to escape. They may also have become aware of other survivors in need of their help. Somewhere on the ship, a pack of nekatra is on the hunt, which could pose a serious threat to poorly armed PCs. If they are skilled in close combat, you could have them encounter the nekatra early in Act II, but it is otherwise recommended to wait until they have found firearms on the bridge.</p><ul><li><p>@JournalEntry[The Medlab]: The medlab quickly becomes the hub for the survivors’ evacuation efforts.

The unrest caused by the arrival of the Emissaries has made things even worse. Weapons and armor are desirable objects in the Horizon, regardless of who you are or where you live.</p><h4>WEAPON TECHNOLOGY IN THE HORIZON</h4><p>Just like regular gear, weapons and armor are divided into tech tiers – Primitive, Ordinary, Advanced and Factionary.</p><p></p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Vulkanderringer.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><br /><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Vulkanpistol.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p></p><h4>VULCAN WEAPONS</h4><p>Vulcan weapons fire tiny rockets with explosive heads. Firing and reloading is mechanical and the weapons require no cells. Vulcan weapons have a low recoil to enable steady automatic fire. As they are easily pirated, they are common everywhere in the Horizon, and so is the ammunition.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Vulkankarbin.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p>Partisans, rebels, and explorers all use Vulcan weapons, often adorned with mythological or traditional images and patterns. Apart from the explosive rounds, homing and vibrating ammunition is also available, and come with cells built into special magazines.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Vulkanspruta.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">SPECIAL VULCAN WEAPONS</div><ul><li><strong>VULCAN PISTOL ARAX OMIR</strong>: A big, heavy pistol with a nasty reputation for causing wounds that heal slowly.</li><li><strong>VULCAN SCORPION</strong>: A Vulcan pistol capable of automatic fire. Popular among criminals but very difficult to handle.</li><li><strong>VULCAN PDW</strong>: A hybrid between a carbine and a pistol, produced and marketed by Nestera as a “personal defense weapon”. Used by bodyguards as it is more discreet than a carbine.</li><li><strong>LEGIONNAIRE CARBINE DAYAL-3</strong>: A carbine produced and used by the Legion. Comes with a built-in grenade launcher, Advanced recoil dampeners and an extra-large drum magazine.</li></ul><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Acceleratorpistol.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><h4>ACCELERATOR WEAPONS</h4><p>Accelerator weapons utilize magnetic acceleration of tiny projectiles, hence the name. They are almost recoil-free, but their low rate of fire limits their military use. Thanks to their excellent precision however, they are popular with colonists, hunters and sharpshooters.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Acceleratorkarbin.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p>The Zenithian Hegemony favors accelerator guns over Vulcans just for the sake of precision. Some accelerator weapons have a “silent” mode, but this limits their capability to pierce armor. Accelerator weapons are hard to copy, unlike Vulcans.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Ackskastare.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><div class=\"blueheader\">SPECIAL ACCELERATOR WEAPONS</div><ul><li><strong>TWIN CARBINE</strong>: A double barrel accelerator carbine. Both barrels fire at the same time. Has a tendency to overheat easily, and the GM only has to spend 2 DP to cause a weapon jam.</li><li><strong>ACCELERATOR RIFLE NESTERA PAROX</strong>: Nestera’s flagship sniper rifle, known for its tremendous penetrating power. Can even stop an armored gravcraft.</li></ul><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Termalderringer.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Termalpistol.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><h4>THERMAL WEAPONS</h4><p>Thermal weapons fire a slug of superheated matter towards their target. This process requires huge amounts of energy, which means that some thermal weapons even require fusion batteries. The adapter between the battery and the weapon is heavy and cumbersome, and the battery itself must be carried as a backpack.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Termalkarbin.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p>The weapon still requires a magazine as hydrogen is needed for the actual shot. Heavy weapons are exceptions to this as they instead use big cassettes that are magazine and battery combined into one.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Termalspruta.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><h4>STUN WEAPONS</h4><p>Stun weapons – popularly known as zap weapons – send powerful electrical pulses through a corridor of ionized air created by a laser beam. This is very effective over short distances when the shooter doesn’t wish to seriously injure the target. Zap tech is available as an add-on to all thermal weapons and as separate weapons.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Lĺngbössa.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><h4>PRIMITIVE RANGED WEAPONS</h4><p>Blowpipes, bows and different kinds of long rifles are all examples of Primitive ranged weapons. There are no uniform principles followed by makers of long rifles, which means that all ammunition is unique to one make of rifle.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>SALADIN GRAPE GUN</h5><p>A version of the long rifle, but with the bullet substituted for “grapes”, tiny pieces of metal that expand in a cloud when the weapon is fired, which makes aiming less important. The generous spread of the grapes plus the impressive damage it can cause in close combat makes the grape gun a very imposing weapon.</p></div><h4>EXPLOSIVES</h4><p>Explosives in the Horizon can be anything from Primitive detonite capsules to Advanced thermobaric grenades. Detonite is a common explosive sold in standardized units (0.25 kilograms) with modular multi-function detonators, or as satchel charges. Larger so-called breach charges are specially constructed charges designed to destroy roads, bridges, buildinga or slow and parked vehicles. Powerful charges can cause a lot of smoke and tear up dust from the ground, especially in dry environments. The smoke covers the same area as the blast radius of the charge for one scene. Grenades are detonite or thermanite charges with additives designed to create specific blast effects.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Missilsystem, portabelt.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><h4>MISSILE AND GRENADE LAUNCHERS</h4><p>Regular missile systems in the Horizon are mass-produced for military groups and factions. They are usually rocket-based and have explosive warheads that function like grenades or are armor-piercing. So-called firestorm systems fire incendiary warheads.</p><p></p><div class=\"blueheader\">GRENADES</div><br />The statistics for the different grenades are found in table 6.12 below. A grenade thrown by hand has Short Range.<p></p><ul><li><strong>STUN</strong>: the grenade detonates with a loud bang and a blinding flash. Deals stress instead of damage.</li><li><strong>SMOKE</strong>: the grenade spreads thick smoke covering everything within Short Range.</li><li><strong>SENSOR SMOKE</strong>: as above, but the smoke also blocks sensors and makes them unusable within the smoke.</li><li><strong>FRAG</strong>: the grenade detonates with a small explosion but spreads shrapnel.</li><li><strong>CONCUSSION</strong>: the grenade detonates with a powerful explosion.</li><li><strong>INFERNO</strong>: the grenade detonates with a very powerful but concentrated explosion.</li><li><strong>THERMAL</strong>: the grenade spreads a cloud of flames, setting fire to people and gear caught by the blast.</li><li><strong>THERMOBARIC</strong>: the grenade detonates with a powerful explosion and the shockwave spreads a big cloud of fire.</li></ul><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Kastarsystem, portabelt.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>TABLE 6.11 BREACH CHARGES</h4><table><thead><tr><th>TYPE</th><th>WEIGHT</th><th>EFFECT/TARGET</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Small</td><td>About 5 kilograms</td><td>Thin walls, normal vehicles</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>About 10 kilograms</td><td>Thick walls, heavy vehicles</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy</td><td>About 100 kilograms</td><td>Entire houses, bridges</td></tr><tr><td>Massive</td><td>About 1 ton</td><td>Roads, entire blocks</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>MELEE WEAPONS</h4><p>There is wide range of different melee weapons in the Horizon. Only a handful of the primitive variants are described below. Ordinary and Advanced melee weapons were engineered for combat onboard space stations or spaceships, as an alternative to firearms.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Durahillebard.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p>Ordinary melee weapons can be purchased from most merchants with flexible morals. Primitive weapons could be anything from blunt instruments and broken bottles to swords and axes.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Energistav.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p><strong>Power weapons</strong> have hydraulic pistons that activate on impact for increased damage. Dura weapons have vibrating blades made from duralite that give them better cutting capabilities. Duralite blades are necessary to withstand the force of the vibrations created by the weapon. Dura claws come mounted on a glove and some models are retractable. Extending the claws – “drawing” them – is a fast action. Both power and dura weapons are cell-powered, and work like their Primitive counterparts if the cells are depleted.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Chockbatong.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p><strong>Stun weapons</strong> deliver powerful electric shocks in addition to the damage from the actual blow (page 133 @JournalEntry[Weapons and Armor]). Energy weapons release a thermic blast that is much more dangerous than the hit itself. A certain amount of force is required to trigger the thermic effect, a function that has been added to limit the risk of self-harm. Some energy weapons also come with stun capabilities. Both stun and energy weapons require cells. When a cell is depleted, the weapon works like its Primitive counterpart.</p><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/Mercuriumsvärd.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></div><p><strong>Mercurium weapons</strong> are based on Advanced technology where liquid metals in the hilt of a weapon are activated and form a blade, after which they turn solid. Drawing and activating a mercurium weapon is one fast action. A cell is required to power the weapon. When the cell is depleted, the blade is extended and stays in solid form. A recharged cell used in a melee</p><h4>PERSONAL PROTECTION AND ARMOR</h4><p>The inhabitants of the Horizon have always used body armor for protection, from simple leather suits to mechanized battle exos.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>AHLAM’S HAND FAN</h5><p>The courtesans of Ahlam’s Temple prefer subtle energy weapons. Rumors accuse them of using poison applied to hair needles, or that they use poisonous lipstick and kiss their victims to death, they themselves being immune to the venom from slow, gradual exposure. A weapon confirmed to be in the courtesans’ arsenal is the hand fan, a weapon with Advanced energy technology. The tips of the fan discharge energy in silent bursts when the fan is open and quickly strikes at a target. The energy burns like a very sharp knife through most known materials, as long as they are fairly thin. Opening and closing the fan is a fast action. Opening it can be done in the same action as the weapon is drawn. The fan can only be parried with if it is closed.</p></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> PRIMITIVE ARMOR</h5><p>Primitive body armor is used only by the least civilized of tribes and nomads. It is commonly crafted from organic fibers, pelts, wood, bone or antlers. Jackets, coats and suits of leather are common garments for travelers and could be considered light Primitive armor.</p><p><strong>Heavy Primitive armor</strong> is usually carbide or metal plates linked together and shaped based on the wearer’s body, or an armanite shell riveted onto flexible overalls.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ORDINARY ARMOR</h5><p>Ordinary armor is designed to protect against the common weapon types and is based on flexible but tough weaves of armanite. The heavier models have extra carbide plating and duralite reinforcements in sensitive areas.</p><p><strong>Exo shells</strong> are space suits designed to protect against vacuum and other hazardous environments, but they also offer some protection from violence, especially the heavier models. Exo shells have an oxygen supply that lasts for eight hours and vacuum soles that stick to level surfaces, such as ship hulls for example.</p><p><strong>Protective clothing</strong> is made from thin armanite weaves and are available as overalls, coats, jacket or pants.</p><p><strong>Light armor</strong> is also made from armanite weaves. A light helmet is included, with a visor that protects the eyes. Light armors are the standards uniform of the Coriolis Guard and many freelance bodyguards and mercenaries.</p><p><strong>Heavy armor</strong> consists of thick armanite sheets or duralite and carbide plating fastened in special pockets sewn onto a regular light armor. The helmet covers the entire head and has a full-face visor. The armed forces of most of the factions wear heavy armor only if they expect combat.</p><p>Putting on the heavy plates takes several minutes which means it cannot be done in combat. The soldiers of the Order of the Pariah have special black armanite mail with duralite reinforcements, easily recognizable from afar and associated with both oppression and strength.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/stridsexo_rustning.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ADVANCED ARMOR</h5><p>Advanced armor is designed to protect against thermal attacks, something other armors offer weak protection from. Advanced suits of armor are expensive and hard to come by.</p><p><strong>Ablative pads</strong> are materials that dissipate energy when hit by high-power attacks, to make less energy penetrate and reach the wearer. Ablative pads are add-ons to other armor and must be renewed after every hit. Doing so requires a technology roll and a space part (A).</p><p><strong>Battle exos</strong> are massive things, designed only for storm troopers and palace guards. They are based on a standard suit of heavy armor mounted on an exo skeleton with reinforced servos. As the exo gives the wearer extra strength and endurance, the armor can be made very strong and heavy. A superconductive mesh under the surface helps to spread out thermal attacks over a larger area. The suit is vacuum-proof and has built-in sealer technology that repair holes to keep the suit pressurized.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>BATTLE EXO XOAR JANISSARY</h5><p>The Janissary exo is advertised as Xoar’s version of the Order’s animated armor. Its quick spring servos, vacuum suit, jet actuators and built-in weapons make it a monster on the battlefield. The sheer size of the suit makes it unfit for use onboard ships or in bunkers, however. The Janissary is equipped with a grenade launcher, the Xoar Pulse accelerator carbine (bonus +1, Weapon Damage 3, CRIT 1) and a duralite axe blade (Weapon Damage 3, CRIT 1). The exo is used by the Hegemony’s janissary unit.</p></div><div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch6/arachni2 copy2.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"1200\" /></div><h4>SHIELDS</h4><p>Shields come in many forms, from simple leather and wood shields used by Sogoi tribes to armanite shields. Advanced shields are only available as faction tech. The riot shield is made from partly transparent armanite and is used mainly by riot police. Combat shields are expandable covers for one soldier, with small holes to fire a gun through and transparent armanite windows for scouting.</p><h4>LICENSES</h4><p>Without the proper licenses, purchasing, using and producing weapons is illegal in the civilized parts of the Horizon. Without a license (or the talent Licensed, page 73 @Item[Licensed]), you can only obtain weapons and armor illegally through contacts in the right places or factions. Licenses purchased on Coriolis will be valid in affiliated places as well, with some local variations. Most space ports and portal stations have sensor equipment that scan for weapons and contraband.</p><h4>WEAPON AND ARMOR FEATURES EXPLAINED</h4><p>Weapons and armor can have different features and add-ons. These are explained in detail below. Unique rules for specific models are explained in the descriptions above.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> WEAPON FEATURES</h5><p>The list below describes the different features a weapon might have.</p><ul><li><strong>Anti-vehicle</strong> means that the weapon is designed to take out vehicles or fortifications. The weapon does +2 damage against these targets.</li><li><strong>Armor-piercing weapons</strong> fire very fast or extra heavy projectiles that penetrate armor more effectively, but tend to cause less damage to soft targets. The Armor Rating of the target is reduced by 2, but the damage is reduced by 1 if the target has no armor.</li><li><strong>Automatic fire</strong> means that the weapon is capable of fully automatic fire (page 89 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</li><li><strong>Bulky weapons</strong> cannot be used standing up without a weapon harness, or the shooter will suffer a -2 to <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">ranged combat</strong>.</li><li><strong>Cell-powered melee weapons</strong> require a cell to function. Without a cell, they are treated as their Primitive counterparts.</li><li><strong>Fire</strong> makes objects and targets catch fire when they are hit by the weapon (see Fire in Chapter 5). The number tells you how many dice to roll for the fire each turn.</li><li><strong>Flexible weapons</strong>, such as whips, can be used to pin an opponent even without rolling extra sixes (see page 86 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]) – the first six rolled can be used to achieve a grapple hold.</li><li><strong>Light weapons</strong> only count as half an item in the character inventory (page 27 @JournalEntry[The Player Character]). They are also easier to carry concealed, requiring an <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> test for someone to spot the weapon.</li><li><strong>Heavy weapons</strong> count as two items in the character inventory.</li><li><strong>High capacity weapons</strong> have extra-large magazines or extra cells that enable the shooter to ignore the first 1 rolled when firing fully automatic fire (page 89 @JournalEntry[Chapter 5 - Combat]).</li><li><strong>Long weapons</strong> add a +2 to the weapon’s initiative bonus – but only in the first turn of combat.</li><li><strong>Mercurium</strong> means that the blade of the weapon is hidden inside the hilt, requiring an <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> test with a -2 modifier to spot during a search.</li><li><strong>Reliable weapons</strong> are simple and robust, and will almost never break. The weapon jam effect will cost the GM 4 DP instead of 3.</li><li><strong>Slow weapons</strong> can only be fired every other turn.</li><li><strong>Single-shot weapons</strong> have no magazines and must be reloaded between each shot.</li><li><strong>Silent</strong> is a function that can be activated (a fast action) to make the weapon quieter and harder to detect when it is fired (requiring an <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong> test). A weapon in silent mode does -1 damage.</li><li><strong>Stun</strong> means that the weapon inflicts stress instead of damage.</li><li><strong>Thermal sweep</strong> means that the weapon can fire a continuous thermal beam that can be swept across several enemies. This works like automatic fire above.</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> ARMOR FEATURES</h5><p>Some armor suits listed above have one or more extra features. Choose the corresponding number of extra features from the list below.</p><ul><li><strong>Built-in weapon</strong>: The armor has a built-in weapon – a pistol, dagger or short sword. The weapon must be purchased separately.</li><li>Bulky armor gives the wearer a -2 to <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong> rolls.</li><li><strong>Camouflage unit</strong>: When activated, the unit creates a camouflage field around the suit that makes it almost invisible and very difficult to detect (-3 to <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">observation</strong>).</li><li><strong>High-density armanite</strong>: +1 to Armor Rating.</li><li><strong>Hydrostatic gel</strong>: +3 to Armor against explosions or falling.</li><li><strong>Oxygen supply</strong>: Eight hours’ worth of oxygen, in a closed helmet.</li><li><strong>Magnetic boots</strong>: The boots of the suit have electromagnets to make them work in zero-G and stick to ship hulls.</li><li><strong>Micro servos</strong>: Give a +1 to <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong> for jumping and running.</li><li><strong>Reinforced exo servos</strong>: +2 to <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">force</strong> rolls. Throwing weapons have their damage increased by 1.</li><li><strong>Thermostatic suit</strong>: See details under Survival and Colonization on page 117 @Item[Thermostatic suit].</li><li><strong>Vacuum suit</strong>: Protects against vacuum and radiation.</li><li><strong>Zero-G jet</strong>: Tiny thrusters give increased maneuverability in zero-G (+1 to <strong style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">dexterity</strong>).</li></ul><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> AMMUNITION, CELLS AND RELOADS</h5><p>One unit of ammo is included when you buy a weapon. It could be a magazine, a cell or just a handful of arrows or bullets. In Coriolis, you don’t keep track of your ammo shot by shot, but you could still run out and need to reload. Extra ammunition – abstracted as “reloads” – will cost you differently depending on what weapon you are using. If you have purchased three extra units of ammunition for example, write “reload x 3” in your gear list.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"ci78FF37L1xd8iBm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266994,"modifiedTime":1680592734145,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"kpSTkcIu7eg2RKP9","sort":0,"_id":"zWheg8fyDNZLzD8V"}

Most people share roughly the same daily routines and the division of the day into four watches: morning, day, evening and night. The morning and day watches are devoted to work and the evening watch to one’s family, the Icons, or leisure. During the night watch, decent people sleep, but the party life continues for the privileged, students and criminals. True believers start each watch with prayer, but visits to a chapel or shrine usually take place at the end of the day watch or during the evening. In the larger cities and on Coriolis, life is rather easy in regards to supplies, food, entertainment and information, but the lives of colonists, stationaries, nomads, and slummers are harder as one or more of these resources may be scarce.</p><h4>A DAY IN THE COLONY</h4><p>Planetside colonists struggle each and every day. Keeping the colony safe requires constant work on domes, survival tents, or longhouses. Resources must be gathered and stockpiled, regardless of whether it is lumber, xenoanimals, minerals, or artifacts. The day usually starts with communal breakfast and prayer before the arduous labor begins. There is hardly anything in the way of entertainment, apart from what can be imported by free traders – holo stories, news or, at best, macro tags with some Bulletin shows. The night is spent guarding the colony against external threats.</p><h4>A DAY ON THE SPACE STATION</h4><p>A day in the life of the stationary is similar to that of the colonist, but is centered on the space station’s endless cycle of docking, loading, repairs, and service. The cold of space, vacuum, radiation storms, and many other threats force the stationaries to live and work in shifts during all watches. When one group begins their morning watch, another group crawls into bed. The lack of space onboard means that food and supplies must be rationed. Perishable goods, other than what can be grown in the hydroponic greenhouses onboard, are rare luxuries. The supply of news and entertainment such as holo dramas is usually good, unless the station is very remote.</p><h4>A DAY IN THE SWARM</h4><p>For the nomad, every day is a journey, or so the saying goes. The nomads work just as hard as the colonists and stationaries, but enjoy the freedom of waking up to new valleys, oases, moons, or systems, depending on how the group travels. The day is not structured around the watches like that of other people, although the care for the life support, the hydroponics and the reactors is very strict. The available entertainment is often indigenous to the swarm, such as leather ball, storytelling, dancing, or tarrab performances. News and information are acquired at stops along the way, and “what you don’t know, you don’t know”, as the smiling efrite would say.</p><h4>A DAY IN THE CITY</h4><p>In the cities, your social status determines everything, from the slummers at the bottom of the ladder to the privileged at the very top. In between the two live the plebeians, the entrepreneurs and the bureaucrats. A day in the life of a slummer is a naked fight for survival. Whether it is about finding food, shelter, or a safe place to sleep, it never ends. Alms from the faithful make it easier, but never easy.</p><p>The slummers’ perfect opposites are the privileged – rich business owners, emirs, factionaries, and high-ranking officials who live off their savings – for whom a day is usually spent trying to expand one’s personal wealth, power, or influence. The privileged are the only ones in the Horizon who have proper leisure time, perhaps devoted to hunting, racing or just partying. Some of the privileged apply themselves to studying, research, or exploration, although usually as patrons for others who are less well off.</p><p>Between the two extremes are the “plebeians”, the day laborers, those who make sure the wheels keep turning. From the lowliest factory worker, the carriers in the jungles and mountains, and the palace cleaners, to plantation workers, light globe divers, and dockworkers – they are the ordinary people of the Horizon’s cities. Their days are filled with hard work from morning to evening, interrupted only by short breaks and silent prayer. Sleeping is everyone’s favorite hobby, with holo dramas and drug use being the runners up.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"4RlPlzcKx7Rjr2if","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"yzecoriolis","systemVersion":"3.0.12","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680376266456,"modifiedTime":1680376266456,"lastModifiedBy":"GyrqPCYtbXkNshoX"},"folder":"A9gK0tT6TNHcUS5E","sort":0,"_id":"zhCB7XOeQWWGFsHQ"}

Most nomads in the Federation are from the Quadrant of the Pillar, the Rimward Reach or Nharmada, but the Kyhber swarm from Algol, the salvage nomads from Odacon and the Jebel and Chambi clans from Melik are also represented here. The prime goal of the faction is to strengthen the nomads against the other factions whose claims in the Horizon have grown considerably, especially since the founding of Coriolis.</p><p>The spokesperson for the Federation on Coriolis is Abyeia Goharshûd, a proud Quadrant mogul descendant of  Housyan blood. She was originally a member of the Free League and tried to lobby for the nomad cause there, but after a falling out, she and her nomad allies left the League and worked independently for a while on Coriolis. The nomads’ need for a representative at the Council was becoming increasingly urgent, and bit by bit, rival clans and families came together in support of Goharshûd and the campaign to get her a seat on the Council.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-corerules/images/ch9/nomader_ENG.webp\" /></div><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> NEW POLICIES</h5><p>What kind of issues the faction would address at the Council is uncertain, but it is likely that they would demand that the nomad culture be treated as equal to that of other peoples, and act as political opposition to the Zenithian factions – after all, it is they, not the nomads, who are the newcomers in the Horizon. In the popular assembly on Coriolis, the nomads have argued that the Zenithians must start respecting old laws and decrees, but up until recently, the Zenithian factions have responded to the demands without interest – something they are now beginning to regret. Suddenly a powerful force in the popular assembly, the nomads have demanded a seat on the Council of Factions – or else. Their threats include the disruption of Consortium trade in the Quadrant of the Pillar and Free League activities in the Nharmada system, and a collective strike against the prospectors in the Rimward Reach. Thanks to the impressive armada the nomads could scramble if they wanted to, the threats are taken very seriously.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span>  A TROUBLED FEDERATION</h5><p>The giant federation faces a huge internal problem. Not only can they rarely present a unified front – bad blood passed down through generations of feuding tribes makes sure of that – but they also support the ways of old that would see the faction itself divided into different social strata with conflicting class interests. These pre-war alliances and divisions give Goharshûd a difficult faction to unite.</p><p>The nomads from the Quadrant of the Pillar, spoken for by Osman Naqsh-i-Jahan, have turned out to be less than inclined to engage in politics that won’t directly affect the Miran route, but are more than willing to close the portals to the Consortium between Kua and Altai if their sovereignty isn’t recognized. The Rimward Reach swarms, represented by Urcia Kabu, have witnessed first-hand how the Zenithians in the Consortium can affect whole systems with their insidious schemes. They say the time has come to mobilize the fleet unless the Federation is invited into the Council of Factions. The envoy for the Housyan line, Qur Farabi the Blind, seeks the aid of the Free League to set up trade agreements with the Consortium. Moreover, they advocate that the nomads should approach the other cultures of the Horizon through education and compassion. Whose voice is the loudest at any given time could be hard to discern for an outsider. The nomads are also troubled by language confusion within the faction.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> SUPPORT AT THE COUNCIL</h5><p>The so-called “nomad question” has become increasingly inflamed, largely due to the Emissary being offered a seat as observer on the Council of Factions, something the nomads have never even been close to. The Nomad Federation has many allies among the Firstcome factions, who think that the Federation should have been on the Council since its inception. Ahlam’s Temple and the Draconites support the Federation’s claims. These two factions have enjoyed good trade with the nomads for a long time. Not all Firstcome factions feel the same way about the nomads, however. The Order of the Pariah and the Federation are not officially speaking to each other after the attack on the nomad Tanziamat clan on Zalos-B.</p><p>The Zenithian factions are not happy with the Federation’s new demands. The Consortium and, to some extent, the Free League, both trade oriented groups, are suspicious towards these potential competitors, and the Legion is uneasy with the Federation’s naval strength. The Zenithian Hegemony has yet to air an opinion either way about the nomads. Politics is a game of shah, after all.</p><h5><span class=\"cli\"></span> THE MIGHTY FLEET</h5><p>The Nomad Federation controls the by far the largest fleet in the Horizon, although a great part of it consists of civilian ships and it is spread over many systems. Recent reports suggest that the nomads have begun forming larger armed convoys. Suhaima Taslim spoke with force on a Bulletin show, saying that if the militarization of the nomad fleet continues, the Legion will have to respond. Goharshûd countered, saying that more corsairs are stalking the nomad routes than before because the Consortium’s bulk haulers have begun reaching the poorer systems where they drive out the local traders, forcing ordinary people to turn to piracy.
