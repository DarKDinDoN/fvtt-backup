With Voz defeated, the PCs are free to explore the cave complex that leads to the lowest level of Citadel Altaerein—and the elf gate ring that both the necromancer Voz and the sinister Cinderclaw cult want to restore, each for their own nefarious ends.

It immediately animates  if anyone tries to enter area <b>D8</b>, as detailed in the Creature section.</p><p><b>Creature:</b> The doorwarden has disguised itself as the easter half of the chamber’s double door. As soon as anyone attempts to enter this room, the door seems to open as the doorwarden steps forward to bar entry  into the room. It immediately speaks in a sonorous voice in Elven, saying, “The custodian of Alseta’s Ring dwells beyond. Only those who carry her blessed sign  may pass.” The doorwarden steps aside if anyone  displays the religious symbol of Alseta (such as the  one the PCs may have discovered in area <b>B16</b>) and does not further interfere with the PCs until they leave  and return. Without a religious symbol, a character who knows of Alseta’s symbol (note that it appears at the base of her statue to the south) can even create a drawing of the symbol with a successful DC 15 Craft  check. Feel free to allow other creative solutions to work as well.</p><p>If the PCs attempt to enter the room without showing  Alseta’s symbol, or if they attack the doorwarden at  any time, the construct immediately attacks them.  It does not pursue foes beyond area <b>D7</b> or <b>D8</b>, but otherwise fights until it is destroyed.</p><blockquote><h4>Doorwarden Crea Ture 5</h4>Page 86<br><b>Initiative</b> Deception +11</blockquote><p>Once the PCs have defeated or bypassed the doorwarden, they can freely enter the room.</p><blockquote>This plain rectangular room contains several empty chests, old wooden tables, and mostly barren shelves. It may have once been used as a vault or records room, but today, only a few scraps of paper remain.</blockquote><p>In pre-Earthfall times, this chamber served as a place for the caretaker of Alseta’s Ring to live. More  recently, though, the Order of the Nail Hellknights  used it as a place to store the order’s historically significant valuables and paperwork, once they figured out how to placate the doorwarden that guarded the entrance to the chamber.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b></p><p> This is the vault where the Order of  the Nail kept its historically significant artifacts and  documents. The Hellknights took all of the most  important and powerful items with them when they  moved to Citadel Vraid but deliberately left behind  one important piece of paperwork—the deed to Citadel Altaerein. The lictor at the time had no interest in retaining a presence in Isger, but he had a mercurial  and whimsical streak in him that compelled him  to leave the deed behind, so that anyone brave and  resourceful enough to find their way to this deepest part of the fortress would be rewarded. A successful DC 15 Society check (or automatic  confirmation from Alak, if he is asked) confirms  that possession of this deed grants legal rights and  ownership of the citadel to the deed’s possessor, by  local, national, and Hellknight law. Technically, the  Order of the Nail could contest this ownership, but if Alak is consulted, he can confirm that his order has  little interest in Citadel Altaerein or Isger today, and that it is unlikely to contest the PCs’ claim to the ruined castle. After all, the cost for repairing Citadel Altaerein  and maintaining it is not something the Order of  the Nail is eager to front—whether or not the PCs themselves are prepared to foot this bill is something  that they’ll have to decide for themselves. The next volume of Age of Ashes has additional information for how the PCs can use downtime to rebuild and repair  Citadel Altaerein, and eventually use it as their own base of operations. In addition to approving of the PCs taking  possession of the keep, Alak offers to inform the Order’s leaders of this development and speak to them  on the PCs’ behalf, assuring them that the PCs are responsible and trustworthy owners, should they wish  to take possession of Citadel Altaerein. “It’s best for the citadel to fall into hands capable of restoring and respecting it,” he says. “Far better you own Altaerein  than for it to persist in its role as home to monsters and hooligans, I’d say.”</p><p>If the PCs wish to use Citadel Altaerein as their base of operations, they can show this writ of ownership to any artisan, builder, or similar contractor in Breachill.  Those professionals will gladly complete paid work  to help fix up the keep to the PCs’ liking. For more  information about how the repair and rebuilding of  Citadel Altaerein works, see <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #<i>146</i>: <i>Cult of Cinders</i>.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b></p><p> PCs who bypass the doorwarden gain  XP as though they had defeated it.

The merchant whose expected  shipment of goods hasn’t yet arrived, the shepherd  whose herd of goats mysteriously died in the night,  the farmer whose entire season’s harvest was ruined  or stolen—investigating and resolving any of these  matters are considered good jobs for adventurers,  and so Breachill’s town council uses its resources  to hire heroes as needed. These monthly meetings,  known as the Call for Heroes, are distinct from the council’s normal regular governance meetings, a tactic  that separates such matters from regular municipal business and shows the townspeople that the council indeed allots sufficient time to the issues that are often most important to them personally.  Spending public money on hiring adventurers to  help the townspeople serves several purposes, as far as Breachill’s leadership is concerned. First, it provides the townspeople with an official and fully funded way to seek help when they’ve exhausted all other options. Second, it allows the salaried town guard to focus on  run-of-the-mill crimes and mundane threats to the townspeople’s safety. And third, it provides experience  to local adventurers—and allows the council to vet  out-of-town heroes—whose presence and talents the council considers boons to the populace, harking back  to the hero Lamond Breachton, Breachill’s original patron who saved the town’s founders. The council holds a public Call for Heroes once  per month expressly to hear petitions from residents who wish the town to hire adventurers on their behalf.  At the end of a resident’s address to the council, the  council members discuss the petition before voting whether to expend public funds on it. For petitions that  are approved—and most of the one or two requests per month are approved—the council then opens the floor to adventurers in attendance at the meeting who wish to tackle the challenge. Heroes looking for work  often attend these meetings with a prepared list of  qualifications, and the council hires an appropriate  number of candidates who are well suited for each  job. After the meeting, the adventurers are expected  to follow up regularly with the petitioner and with  the council. Those heroes who resolve their assigned  challenges are paid handsomely in gold pieces and  receive preferential consideration for future official work that might use their demonstrated talents.</p><p>At the beginning of “Hellknight Hill,” the PCs are adventurers who plan to attend this month’s Call for  Heroes to lobby for work. As such, each PC should have a reason for doing so, although their motivations might differ wildly. It’s up to each PC to decide why  they’re planning to approach the council for work.  Before this adventure begins, encourage the players to decide how each character knows or is tied to the other PCs, if at all.</p><p>A list of ideas for why a PC might be planning to seek work from the Breachill Town Council appears in the <i>Age of Ashes Player’s Guide</i>; each is keyed to one of the new backgrounds also presented there.</p>","_id":"2kDgWZxTXYISzDjm"}

Their intensive drills included fully outfitted mock battles with each other, simulated tactical missions, and practice for low-stakes initiations (those other than the infamous Hellknight  test, which was conducted in area <b>A10</b>). Before such  drills, the participating Hellknights would listen to  their instructions here, usually from a maralictor or  paralictor, before the iron gate to the north would open, prompting them to take their battle positions in the courtyard.

The piecemeal documentation also  includes a list of recruits’ names, along  with indications of those who had been  issued “temporary order badges.” This is a reference to the discarded Nail insignias  found on the floor; a successful DC 15 Society check reveals that the Hellknights considered these insignias sacred symbols of their order, and that they’d be valuable  to anyone with any ties to the knights,  or any current or former member of any Hellknight order (including  Alak Stagram, the Hellknight in area <b>A10</b>).</p>","_id":"3M2rb37cdwXgJaB2"}

The path to Citadel Altaerein is known to be fairly safe, so the PCs might Hustle as their exploration activity (<i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i> 480). Most other exploration activities  don’t gain the PCs much. Once they actually begin exploring the citadel itself, you can ask what the PCs  are doing and determine their exploration activities. However, the location is small enough in scale that you might simply go room by room on a map instead.As the PCs draw near to Citadel Altaerein, read or paraphrase the following.</p><blockquote>Rising from the hilltop above is a looming structure of  crumbling stone and still-imposing battlements, though  verdant nature is reclaiming the site. Plumes of red smoke—which ambassador Warbal believes to be distress signals from the Bumblebrasher goblins—rise from the roof of the keep’s central tower. This place can only be Citadel  Altaerein, the infamous former home of the Order of the Nail Hellknights, now fallen into ruin. The gate-like doors in the center of the keep hang ajar—not surprising, since no one has maintained this facility in years.</blockquote><p>If the PCs leave town directly after the Call for  Heroes, they soon arrive at the gates of Citadel  Altaerein. In this case, it’s easy for the PCs to find a  fairly comfortable and defensible hillock nearby on which to make camp, and the night passes uneventfully.If the PCs have asked Warbal to accompany them on their journey, she gladly camps with them and uses the campsite as her base of operations during the course  of this adventure. Despite her refined appearance  and manners, she is well acquainted with survival camping and has brought all of the supplies and tools that she needs for an extended stay outside the citadel. She politely refuses to enter the citadel with the PCs, citing the undoubted danger inside, but is happy to remain the PCs’ point of contact outside the gates and watch their horses, should the heroes wish. The PCs don’t need to attempt skill checks to see the smoke signals coming from the top of the citadel. Further, they should already know that these distress signals are tied to the missing Bumblebrasher goblins Warbal described during the Call for Heroes, but if the PCs did not pick up on this fact, allow them a DC 12 Society check to realize it.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Crafting or DC 13 Architecture Lore check reveals that keeps in the style of Citadel Altaerein are typically built with stairways  that lead up to any lookout or battlement areas. Therefore, venturing inside the citadel is the best way to find a path toward the goblins, who are presumably camping or even trapped within. Use the map on page 14 for the encounters in this chapter; note that the stairway to the battlements is located in area <b>A12</b>. </p><p>Below are some general details about the first floor and battlements of the citadel.</p><p><b>Citadel Perimeter:</b></p><p> Significant overgrowth has overtaken the perimeter around the citadel.

As a result, the 10-foot-wide perimeter around the entire citadel is difficult terrain.</p><p><b>Crumbling Walls:</b></p><p> Most of the citadel’s outer structure remains sound. However, the map on page 14 shows several places where the outer walls have crumbled or collapsed entirely, exposing the citadel’s interior to the  elements. These crumbled sections of wall are difficult terrain, but they allow the PCs to access the citadel chamber on the opposite side of the wall without using Altaerein’s main doors. The exteriors of the walls are very steep, and loose stones make climbing the walls a dangerous prospect. A successful DC 20 Climb check is needed to scale the walls as a result, something a PC who succeeds at a DC 10 Crafting check can warn the party of before an attempt to climb is made.</p><p><b>Doors:</b></p><p> Unless otherwise noted, with the exception of secret doors,  Citadel Altaerein’s wooden doors are unlocked. Some doors, especially  exterior doors leading into the citadel, might be stuck or broken, as mentioned in the relevant areas’ descriptions.</p><p><b>Entering the Citadel:</b></p><p> There are public entrances into the citadel from areas <b>A1</b> and <b>A3</b>. The door to area <b>A1</b> is unlocked and ajar, thanks to the monsters, ne’er-do-wells, explorers, and others who have rifled through the keep since it’s been abandoned, but the door to area <b>A3</b> is bolted and tied shut. Note that there is also a locked secret door leading into area <b>A9</b> at the back of the citadel.

The Bumblebrasher chieftain Helba knows of this secret entrance, though, and can inform the PCs of its location once the goblins have been rescued.

After the Hellknights  left, the Bumblebrashers moved in, though  the Cinderclaw cultists have since chased them out. The door to the north is heavily but crudely barricaded to protect the cultists from the grizzly bear trapped there (see area <b>B8</b> for more).

Until relatively recently, they were minions of the Mwangi Jungle’s self-proclaimed Gorilla King, but the defeat of their ruler several years ago threw  their society into chaos. Numerous charau-kas sought out cults to join in the absence of a leader to  follow; many fell in with the Cinderclaws. One of these was the priest Malarunk, who is now trapped  in the level below. Venak and Skorp are of mixed  feelings over this fact, for while they much prefer  the company of their own kind over boggards,  Malarunk is an abusive and cruel taskmaster. For  now, the two charau-kas are quietly plotting their  escape from the cult. When Venak, Skorp, and Werrt notice the PCs, Venak and Skorp hang back  to throw debris while Werrt engages in melee. As soon as Werrt is defeated (or as soon as only one of the two charau-ka remain standing), the charau-kas  give up and beg for mercy. Venak and Skorp can’t  speak Common, unfortunately, but if the PCs can  establish communication, either charau-ka cultist  can reveal the information about the cult detailed in area <b>B6</b>, hoping to be allowed to flee in exchange.

The bookshop is  small, obscure, and tucked into an out-of-the-way corner of Breachill, so by design it receives little foot  traffic, and for good reason—its owner, operator, and chief manuscript expert is Voz Lirayne, a half-elf  who is secretly a cultist of Norgorber. Voz is also a  necromancer, though she takes pains to hide her dabbling in the dark arts from prying eyes. Voz typically conducts her shop’s workload alone, although her obsessive research into Alseta’s Ring and  her time-consuming correspondence with the Scarlet Triad (see below) has forced her to recently take on an apprentice to attend to the shop’s daily business. That apprentice is Calmont, the villainous young man who set off events at the beginning of this adventure. When  Voz learns about Calmont’s arson, she immediately considers him to be fired and, in an attempt to distance  herself from his recent criminal actions, tells anyone who asks that she had already fired him a few days ago.</p><p>When the PCs come to the Reliant Book Company,  they find the shop locked up tight and abandoned, since Voz has left town by this point. The shop’s front door is locked (Thievery DC 20 to Pick the Lock), as are its three windows (Thievery DC 20 to open them), each of which is on a different wall of the four-sided  structure. If the PCs can’t open either the door or a window, they can always smash through one of them (DC 16 Athletics check to Force Open, or Hardness 3, 12 HP, 6 BT). The store’s secluded location means that attempts to Pick a Lock won’t be noticed even during the day, but attempts to Force Open a door or window  without attracting notice require a DC 25 Stealth  check; on a failure, a passerby comes to investigate  in 2d4 rounds. Law-abiding PCs might seek the aid of the town council in getting into the shop. Securing  this aid is actually quite simple, provided the PCs  are still in good standing with Greta and the other  councilors—simply presenting their evidence about  Voz and succeeding at a DC 18 Diplomacy check is enough to gain permission to investigate the closed-up shop. No skeleton key for the shop exists, but the PCs  are given permission to force entry into the building as long as a town representative is present during the  search to ensure that the PCs don’t take advantage of the situation to loot the place (although if the PCs  managed a critical success on the Diplomacy check, they are allowed to search without such supervision). Once the PCs are inside the shop, they find that  it has three primary areas: a public book display and merchandise area, a room with a sign that says “Staff Only” (this is Voz’s research room), and Voz’s personal chambers. If the PCs investigate the public book display and  merchandise area, they find shelves upon shelves of  old books written in myriad languages. At the front of the room is a counter with a ledger of sales as well  as an empty till box (Voz took all of the funds from  this box when she left town). The PCs can examine  the ledger, but they see nothing strange in it beyond  the names of locals, boring-sounding names of books  bought and sold, and reasonable prices connected  to the transactions. Only one of the final entries is of interest—a few days before this adventure began, Voz notes the purchase of a magical parchment that could be used to summon a fire mephit, along with a note next to this entry, dated the day before this adventure began, indicating the magic parchment had gone missing. (This  was the parchment Calmont stole to conjure the fire mephit the PCs fought at the start of the adventure.)</p>","_id":"FKSmtRqAAYpoxvBE"}

Heroes, are you willing to investigate Hellknight Hill?”</blockquote><p>At this point, allow the PCs to introduce themselves  to the council and to present their qualifications as heroes.

If the PCs helped  everyone escape from the fire, Greta thanks them  profusely and awards the party two <i>minor healing potions</i> to help them in the trials they might face at  Hellknight Hill. If they doused the fire entirely, she offers the party a lesser antidote and a lesser antiplague as thank-you gifts. If they accomplished both, she gives them all these items, as well as 50 sp each.</p><p>Regardless, Greta thanks the PCs for any help they provided during the fire. She offers the PCs 10 gp for  the job of contacting the Bumblebrashers and 10 gp for tracking down Calmont, whom she specifically asks the PCs to bring back to the town alive for questioning if at all possible. Both of these rewards are payable as  soon as the PCs complete the associated tasks. The PCs can approach Hellknight Hill whenever they wish, although Greta and the other townspeople encourage them to do so as soon as they can gather the needed provisions. After all, there’s no time to waste tracking down this firebug, helping the goblins, and figuring out what sinister mystery is happening on Hellknight Hill!</p>","_id":"FKXfJgpG1vIHCU7F"}

From the hours of 8:00  p.m. to 8:00 a.m., guard shifts at area <b>C2</b> last for 5 hours, with two mercenaries on duty while the others sleep. </p><p><b>Subtle Heroics:</b> If the PCs have avoided contact with Voz, approach the camp within a week of first visiting the Reliant Book Company, and haven’t assaulted the camp before, then the Bloody Blades are unprepared and take a –4 penalty to Perception checks until they realize the PCs are here to cause trouble.

Dmiri remains inside area <b>C4</b> but observes the battle  through that structure’s narrow wall gaps, and she steps out to join the fight as soon as one of the Bloody Blades is defeated, or as soon as any PC attempts to  enter area <b>C4</b> or <b>C6</b>.

If a PC gets her cooperation through Diplomacy (DC 21) or Intimidation (DC 19), she admits that Voz can be found in the caves, although she attempts to use Deception to guide the PCs toward area <b>C7</b> and the monster that dwells there if she can. The Bloody Blade half-orcs are more talkative if captured, and eagerly tell the PCs that a half-elf hired them to guard the cave complex located on the eastern side of this area so she could use it to flee the region. Further, they say that the half-elf mentioned that she  might camp in the caves while she completed some final research, before she heads off to claim what she called her “great reward.”</p><p><b>Bloody Blade Bounties:</b> A successful DC 18 Society check reveals that the Bloody Blades are a regional small-time mercenary bands known for taking part in highway  robbery and other disreputable endeavors. If Armiger Alak Stagram is still traveling with the PCs, he realizes this automatically and reveals the information to the party. If any Bloody Blades are captured alive and brought back  to Breachill, they’re held until they can be transported  west to Isger’s capital, Elidir, for sentencing. If they’re all slain, proof of their death can be obtained by either  hauling the bodies back to town or leaving them here to be identified by the authorities later. In any event, the  PCs will receive bounties once paperwork is processed in Elidir, about 1 week after the Bloody Blades’ capture  or defeat is reported. For each live half-orc mercenary, the party earns 10 gp, and for delivering Dmiri alive for justice, the PCs earn 50 gp.

Occasionally, the tixitog creeps into the larger spider nest to steal morsels of food and other bits that interest her.  Recently, the spider-obsessed creature absconded with a large egg sac of spiderlings,  which she has embedded into the webs in  the middle of the western wall. If the PCs  move adjacent to that space, the spiders hatch, unleashing a spider swarm. Rather hungry and thinking the PCs might make an easy  meal, the tixitog awaits the PC’s arrival from her hiding place on the ceiling near the cave’s center.

If the PCs reduce her to 20 Hit  Points or fewer, though, the creature might surprise them  by attempting to surrender,  speaking in a weirdly chittering voice. If the PCs question the tixitog,  she introduces herself as Balka and begs to be let  go—promising the PCs her treasure in payment  for their mercy. She also warns them about the  “unpleasant spiders” who live deeper in the caves  and seem to be under the influence of a “strange  spider lady” (this is a reference to Renali in area <b>D2</b>).

In addition to using Diplomacy to Make an Impression (DC 20), there are a few ways to improve Roxie’s attitude toward the PCs. The tavern proprietor shares that her regular crowd, while reliable, frightens off new customers with their reputation for drunken rowdiness and intimidation. If the PCs agree  to organize an event—whether it’s an arm-wrestling contest, a drinking contest, a live music performance, or otherwise—to attract new customers  and such an event actually takes place, Roxie’s attitude improves to friendly. The PCs can organize and execute an event like this in one day, as it’s not difficult to pull in passersby on the street to attend. (As long as the event happens, Roxie will share the information below with the PCs; it doesn’t matter how well the event goes or whether any of the PCs are the winners of any contests they might devise.) If Roxie is friendly, she confides to the PCs that Voz Lirayne, the half-elven proprietor of the Reliant Book Company, a local bookshop, paid her handsomely to keep quiet about the tunnel’s existence as well as Voz’s comings and goings. Voz is a little strange, Roxie admits, and dabbles in what she calls “weird magic, like with skulls and bones and stuff.” Roxie knows nothing else about Voz’s plans, but is not surprised  to hear that they might be nefarious. Roxie can direct the PCs to the  Reliant Book Company, which is both the location of Voz’s shop and where the half-elf lives.</p><p><b>Gathering Information:</b></p><p> The PCs might want to chat with the regulars  in the Pickled Ear and elsewhere to find out whether anyone has seen someone suspicious regularly emerging from the pickle storeroom or tavern, or even inquire about Voz.

In further battles against the  undead, he won’t hesitate to provide aid to the  PCs, as long as he’s at least friendly. After the  fight, if the PCs begin prying open graves, Alak  strongly discourages them from disturbing any  more headstones after the first two efforts prove fruitless, and his attitude toward the PCs worsens by one step should they ignore him and continue to desecrate the graves.</p>","_id":"NrXQQMLkndSIjiNC"}

These warg puppies  are just a few days old and each about the size of a domesticated cat. When the PCs approach, the puppies  both growl and bare their little teeth, but they also  make no move to attack. They’ve been living off of insects and runoff rain water, and are quite hungry.  They’re intrigued by the PCs, and might even play with them if coaxed out of their den with a successful  DC 16 Diplomacy check. If the PCs offer food, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Though the puppies are smarter than animals,  they’re still developing their personalities and  intellects. While predisposed to the cruelty of their  kind, they could grow into friendlier creatures if given love and support. This requires a successful DC 16 Diplomacy check each day, and does not count as  a downtime activity. After 10 successful checks, the warg puppies’ attitude toward a PC becomes friendly, and the creatures will follow a range of commands.  The DC of this Diplomacy check is reduced to 14 for PCs with the Train Animal general feat, because the puppies are somewhere between a person and an animal in intelligence. Since wargs are smarter than  most animals, GMs are encouraged to allow the  warg puppies to follow more complex commands than  normal. </p><p>The mother of the warg puppies might still be lurking in the surrounding wilds, and could well approach the  PCs with a demand to hand over her children. The warg mother herself is a foul-tempered creature, and  such an encounter could give the PCs a complicated moral conundrum: do they return the puppies to their evil mother, doubtless ensuring the creatures grow up  evil themselves, or do the PCs keep the puppies and  nurture them, a decision which is likely to force the PCs to kill the mother of the puppies? If the PCs make significant noise while interacting with the puppies, the adult warg in area <b>A16</b> wanders in to investigate—it attacks the PCs not to defend the puppies (in which it has no interest) but simply because it enjoys crunching humanoid bones in its jaws.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b></p><p> If the PCs rescue the puppies and take them under their wing, award the party 60 XP.</p>","_id":"OQpSs9GeUnQUEWVI"}

Greta and the other council members are easily found  in Breachill’s town hall, and the PCs can secure an  audience with them immediately, though the meeting takes place in a different portion of the building than the charred chambers. How the PCs report their success to the council is up to them, but as long as they report  any conversations they had with Helba or any of the  other Bumblebrashers, they fulfill that aspect of their quest and Greta gladly pays them what she promised. When it comes to Calmont, the PCs may have  decided to take him captive and bring him back to  Breachill. In this case, the PCs can find any member  of the town guard immediately upon returning to  Breachill, at which point the guard escorts the PCs, with their captive, to the town hall. Alternatively, the guard can deliver Calmont to the authorities and have  the council notified, or make any other arrangement the PCs see fit.

In  the few places where the walls are still intact, however,  the delicate carvings indicate that whoever once built these rooms was a skilled artisan. Far to the southwest, a partially melted stone archway opens into a larger room.</blockquote><p>Each of the six <i>aiudara</i> that make up Alseta’s Ring  was also associated with a set of small rooms called  a “waystation” that served as a place where travelers  could rest, learn, and prepare for the often quite different environment or culture that awaited on the far side. These waystations existed in tiny little demiplanes between the entrance and exit of the <i>aiudara</i>, and in the cases of the five remaining gates, these demiplanes exist still. As the Age of Ashes Adventure Path continues, the PCs will need to explore and deal with a wide range of secrets and ancient wards left behind in these places. But when the Ekujae elves trapped Dahak’s manifestation inside of Huntergate, the backlash of fiery  energy lanced across Alseta’s Ring and destroyed the  portal on the far side of the room from Huntergate— Lotusgate. This severed Alseta’s Ring from its link to  Kyonin, but also caused the waystation to phase back  into the Material Plane, manifesting physically even as the blast of dragonfire destroyed it. This ruined complex of half-melted walls and ancient rubble is all that remains today of the Lotusgate waystation. A PC who examines the walls and rubble and succeeds at a DC 30 check to Identify Magic learns that whatever destroyed the walls  of this site was an extremely powerful effect beyond  that which most mortals could create. On a critical  success, this check suggests that the effect that melted and destroyed these walls may well have been from an incredibly powerful dragon.

Malarunk had grand plans to  lead a large number of cultists through Huntergate, claim the surrounding region, and present this new  frontier ripe for conquest to his commander back in  the Mwangi Expanse, a half-dragon boggard named Belmazog. What the Cinderclaws didn’t anticipate was  that Dahak’s influence still haunted the Huntergate  waystation, and as the cultists came through, the  same energies that so long ago destroyed Lotusgate  now damaged Huntergate, rendering it inoperable.  Malarunk still carries the magical arrowhead key required to activate Huntergate, but lacks the skill and ability to repair the portal. Then, when the grauladons caused part of the central structure of Citadel Altaerein to collapse, the only easy method back out of Alseta’s Ring became clogged with rubble.</p><p>After an attempt to dig out the rubble blocking the southern stairs resulted in further collapse that crushed a charau-ka cultist, and after a fight against the guardian of area <b>D8</b> nearly cost him his life, Malarunk and his  remaining minions have been rattling around these  ruined chambers, growing increasingly stir-crazy and desperate. With nothing to eat or drink but sustenance created by magic, their only hope has rested upon the  rest of their cult in the Mwangi Expanse repairing the portal at the far side. He has communicated with Belmazog a few times via <i>dream message</i> and knows that the Ekujae elves are preventing the Cinderclaws from accessing Huntergate for now, yet he still hopes  to receive a <i>dream message</i> every night announcing  that his cult has regained control of the portal’s far side and have repaired it enough for him to reactivate Huntergate and return home.</p><p>The arrival of the PCs gives Malarunk a much-needed distraction.

These portals, which he called <i>aiudara</i>, allowed for instantaneous travel between distant locales. He linked one from the elven capital city  of Iadara to a nexus of magical power many miles to the southwest, at the convergence of several thrumming magical ley lines under a remote forested hill. But he was frustrated in his attempts to form a proper hub—the portal  magic of these first <i>aiudara</i> wouldn’t function if their  destinations overlapped. As a compromise, Candlaron  fashioned a circular chamber around the underground  ley line nexus, then crafted five more <i>aiudara</i> to create a ring of portals. He named this chamber Alseta’s Ring, after the demigoddess of doorways and transitions, and  similarly dedicated each of the six surrounding portals in the chamber to one of six elven divinities. Lotusgate  linked back to Iadara and was dedicated to Alseta herself. Dreamgate, which linked to the western coast of Avistan, was dedicated to Desna. Duskgate, which linked  to a site far to the south in Garund, was dedicated to  Findeladlara, the elven goddess of architecture and art. Huntergate, which linked to the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, was devoted to Ketephys, god of hunting and the moon. Jewelgate, which linked to a vast cavern below what would become known as the Five Kings Mountains, honored Yuelral, the elven goddess of crystals and magic.  Finally, Vengegate, which linked to an island in the Steaming Sea that would one day be known as Hermea, was dedicated to Calistria. Over the centuries that followed, Candlaron’s disappearance, the devastation of Earthfall, and the use of the portals by the dragon god Dahak to manifest an  avatar on Golarion wrought havoc on Alseta’s Ring, and over the course of the next several thousand years it fell into obscurity. In time, the gold dragon Mengkare discovered the portal network and formed a dangerous plan to strike a potentially mortal blow against Dahak but at a horrific cost. Further details on these events and Mengkare’s plan can be found in the Adventure Toolbox beginning on page 70.</p><p>Life above Alseta’s Ring went on. Goblin nations rose, squabbled, and fell. The nomadic human Kellids roamed here, and the imperial Taldans and later the Chelish nation each in turn staked claims on the hill. In time, the lands became known as the nation of Isger, a thrall-state of Cheliax. Then, in 4550 ar, a mysterious town called Breachill was founded near the hill. This town and its strange secrets are detailed further in the article  that begins on page 62. Years after Breachill’s foundation, the knoll’s natural defensibility made it an obvious spot for an order of the infamous Hellknights to build a keep. Hellknights are dedicated to the brutal pursuit of absolute law, and the Order of the Nail in particular is sworn to combat what its members call the regressive mires of the wild. This order built its headquarters, Citadel Altaerein, atop the rise, and the site has been known to the locals as Hellknight Hill ever since.</p><p>When the Hellknights dug into the hill to excavate crypts, vaults, and  dungeons for their fortress, they discovered the ruins of Alseta’s Ring,  yet they never deciphered the purpose of the long-inactive elf gates. In time, the Hellknights abandoned Citadel Altaerein for a much larger and better-funded home to the northwest in Varisia, leaving Hellknight Hill’s fortress mostly abandoned. For a few years, the Hellknights kept a small contingent of guardians to monitor the premises. But as their missions in Varisia mounted, the Order of the Nail abandoned even this effort, and the citadel began to fall into disrepair when its last caretaker left nearly a decade ago. Monsters of all stripes have since moved into the keep, as have a relatively peaceful and self-sufficient band of goblins.</p><p>Recently, a new group has come to the citadel’s dungeons: a cult of Dahak worshippers called the Cinderclaws. Based far to the south in the Mwangi  Expanse, this group of Cinderclaws became stranded in the dungeons  below Hellknight Hill when its leaders managed to temporarily activate  Huntergate. The Dahak cultists became separated from one another, and are divided between the keep’s two basement levels, each of which was cut  off from the other by a recent collapse in the fortress’s main staircase. A  leaderless group of these evildoers lurks in the shallowest dungeon level,  while its truly dangerous sub-commander Malarunk and several of his  minions remain trapped near Alseta’s Ring itself, impatiently waiting for their allies far to the south to reactivate Huntergate so he can return home.</p><p>Meanwhile, a secretive Norgorber cultist in Breachill named Voz Lirayne has discovered the existence of Alseta’s Ring, and now plots to find a way to reactivate it to earn support from a group she’s allied with: the Scarlet  Triad. As tight-lipped as the half-elf has remained about this discovery, however, she’s let too much slip to her apprentice, a greasy halfling man  named Calmont. Himself a ne’er-do-well and an opportunist, Calmont seeks a way to activate the portals for his own gain. This adventure dawns as these threads begin to converge. When the heroes petition the Breachill Town Council for work, as is customary for adventurers in the area, chaos breaks out. Soon it becomes clear that the cause of the fires is linked to Hellknight Hill, and it’s up to the heroes to  find out what plots might envelop the town—the answers might be the only way to save Golarion itself!</p>","_id":"X63P3d2pZCb1bAh3"}

The far end of the escape tunnel leads to a hidden trap door in the basement floor of a dive bar called the Pickled Ear, located in a rundown and out-of-the-way part of Breachill.

Thick sheets of spiderwebs hang from the northern wall.</blockquote><p>The cavern is almost entirely nondescript, but with a successful DC 18 Perception check, a PC notes that the sheets of spiderwebs along the north wall are in fact the walls of a cleverly disguised tent-like structure. The ceiling here is only 10 feet high.</p><p><b>Creature:</b></p><p> Living in the hut is an unusual visitor  from Garund—an anadi woman named Renali (see  page 84 for information on anadis and page 78 for  Renali in particular). The spider-like anadis avoid contact with other humanoid races, for while they are themselves peaceful, they understand well most other humanoids’ swift and emotional reaction to anything  even remotely arachnid in shape. Still, when Renali noticed the Cinderclaws, a group she’s long detested, becoming interested in an old shrine to the elven god Ketephys down in the Mwangi Expanse, she put aside her fears and took a more active stance against them,  an act that led to her becoming stranded here when  Huntergate closed. After fleeing Malarunk and his minions and managing to avoid the barghest in area <b>D3</b>, Renali has sheltered here in this cave for several weeks. She’s somewhat befriended the spiders in area <b>D1</b>, to the extent that neither bothers the other, and has been living on vermin, fungus, and water dripping from the walls for some time now. Her first encounter with Voz a few days ago turned violent, and she’s only now recovered from the fight. Renali is a peaceful woman who hides in her  spidersilk tent when she hears the PCs fighting in area <b>D1</b>. She prefers to avoid the PCs entirely until she hears them fighting the barghest in area <b>D3</b>, in which case she comes to their aid as detailed there. She’ll fight  the PCs only if attacked first, and she would much prefer to talk to them. If the PCs notice her tent for what it is and seem about ready to either enter or damage it, Renali steps  out to greet them, disguised as a human woman. Fortunately, she speaks Common, thanks to the time she spent exploring beyond her home—she maintains a non-hostile stance when she greets the PCs, so that  communication can be established. Since Renali followed the Cinderclaws through Huntergate but found herself trapped in these caverns after the portal shuttered and the cave-in blocked the way back to Alseta’s Ring, she knows quite a bit about how to get to the ring’s chamber as well as about the  cultists trapped there now. If the PCs agree to speak  with her and don’t immediately attack her, she can  inform them not only of the barghest that dwells in area <b>D3</b>, but of the cultists and their leader Malarunk  in area <b>D6</b>, and the ring of portals in area <b>D7</b>. Her primary hope is to find a way back through Huntergate to return to her homeland in the Mwangi Expanse. See her NPC entry on page 78 for more details on how she can help the PCs. If the PCs force a fight, Renali defends herself as  best she can. If reduced below 30 Hit Points, she retreats toward area <b>D6</b> and tries to lure the PCs into  a fight with the barghest or Malarunk, hoping to slink away and hide while her mutual enemies defeat each other.</p><blockquote><h4>Renali Crea Ture 4</h4>Female anadi (page 78)<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +12</blockquote><p><b>XP Award:</b></p><p> For befriending Renali, grant the party 10 XP for a minor accomplishment.</p>","_id":"cHpBEn7YsWyjVEBJ"}

The arena’s edges are painted deep crimson, and an ominous crimson pentagram fills the center.</blockquote><p>This is the staging and observation area for the  infamous Hellknight Test, which all recruits must undertake before they are given official status with the organization. Across all Hellknight orders, the rituals involved in the test are more or less the same. The test  is typically administered at each active Hellknight keep twice each year, although sometimes exceptions are made for armigers who show particular promise or who need to be officially inducted quickly. </p><p>The Hellknight Test involves the leader, or lictor, of  the order (or another suitably high-ranking officer) conducting a long, ceremonial introduction. Then the armiger in question steps into the testing area’s clearly  marked arena, and a ranking spellcaster, or signifer,  summons a devil the order has deemed a suitably challenging opponent. These are often bearded devils,  but can be any devil, depending on the armiger’s  expertise and the officers involved. The armiger and  the devil then fight to the death. If the armiger is victorious, they are inducted as a full, ranking member of the order with the title of Hellknight.</p><p>If the PCs haven’t already discovered the basics of the Hellknight Test, they can attempt a DC 15 Society check to Recall that Knowledge now.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b></p><p> When the PCs enter this area, they see  a handsome, dark-haired man in matte black armor  wielding an heirloom greatsword, moving with  confident and assured technique while engaged in  combat against a snickering imp. The man is Alak  Stagram, an Order of the Nail Hellknight on leave  from Citadel Vraid in Varisia. Though not here on  official business for the Order of the Nail, Alak is  an armiger who hopes someday to take the test and become a Hellknight. When the PCs enter this room, Alak is just about to defeat the imp—in fact, the PCs  see him drive his greatsword through the shrieking  creature’s heart right as they enter the room. If the PCs succeed at a DC 15 Perception check, they see a  small religious symbol of Asmodeus imprinted onto the shoulder of Alak’s armor. If the PCs want to take time to talk with and  perhaps ally with Alak, they’ll have to wait, since just as the Hellknight destroys the imp, two more of the little devils hiss and drop down from the rafters.  Alak grumbles, “Great. More bloody hell monkeys,”  and gestures toward the PCs to take strategic battle positions as combat begins.</p><blockquote><h4>Imps (2)</h4><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 87<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +7</blockquote><blockquote><h4>Alak Stagram Crea Ture 2</h4>Male human fighter 2<br><b>Perception</b> +7<br><b>Languages</b> Common, Infernal, Varisian<br><b>Skills</b> Athletics +8, Intimidation +4, Religion +5, Society +4<br><b>Str</b> +4, <br><b>Dex</b> +1, <b>Con</b> +3, <b>Int</b> +0, <b>Wis</b> +1, <b>Cha</b> +0<br><b>Items</b> full plate armor, greatsword, javelin (2)<br><b>AC</b> 20; <b>Fort</b> +9, <b>Ref</b> +7, <b>Will</b> +5<br><b>HP</b> 34<br><b>Attack of Opportunity</b>[reaction]]<br><b>Speed</b> 20 feet<br><b>Melee</b>[one-action] greatsword +10 (versatile P), <br><b>Damage</b> 1d12+4 slashing<br><b>Ranged</b>[one-action] javelin +7 (versatile P), <br><b>Damage</b> 1d6+4 piercing<br><b>Intimidating Strike</b> [two-actions] (<i>PathfinderCore Rulebook</i> 146)<br><b>Power Attack</b>[two-actions] (<i>PathfinderCore Rulebook</i> 144)</blockquote><p><b>Special:</b></p><p> When the dust from combat settles, Alak  takes the extra time to use his greatsword to ensure each imp is truly dead, beheading each devil with a smirk of satisfaction. “One must always be sure these nasty things are really finished off,” he says. “It seems my predecessors here perhaps lost sight of that.” Once  done, he pulls out a length of black cloth from a pouch on his belt and wipes the gore from his sword. “I thank you for your assistance, by the way. I suspect you’re not looters—who are you then, if you please?”</p><p>Alak could be a valuable ally to the PCs throughout  this adventure, depending on the conversation  that ensues and any friendship the PCs show him.  Specifically, Alak can be a helpful ally during this  adventure, particularly with Guardian’s Way in Chapter 3 and the Hellknight crypts in Chapter 4.  Alak begins the conversation with an attitude of indifferent toward the PCs, and  interacts with them with a veneer of cool courtesy.  If his attitude ever drops to hostile, the Hellknight ends the conversation with a curt hand gesture and a derisive raise of his eyebrow and walks away, perhaps even fighting the PCs if they try to stop him. If Alak’s attitude is improved to friendly or better, his charming and sarcastic nature becomes more evident.</p><p>There are several ways to improve Alak’s attitude. If, at any point in the conversation, the PCs give Alak the Order of the Nail insignias from area <b>A6</b>, he gently takes them, smooths their edges, and pockets  them, thanking the PCs for showing respect to his  order when the citadel’s previous looters did not.  This improves his attitude to friendly. Also, if the  PCs give Alak the book his father wrote (see area <b>A16</b>), Alak is even more grateful, given the item’s  personal significance to him. Giving Alak the book improves Alak’s attitude to helpful as long as he isn’t hostile; if he’s hostile, it instead improves his attitude to unfriendly. If the PCs find Alak’s family signet ring in the  Hellknight crypts below and give it to him (likely  not possible until later in this adventure), as long as he’s not hostile, this always improves his attitude  to helpful. Otherwise, it improves his attitude by one step. Additionally, Alak appreciates sarcasm and dark  humor. As long as it’s not disrespectful, especially  to the Hellknight orders, Alak’s attitude toward the  PCs improves to friendly after one or more PCs  make three appropriately sarcastic or darkly witty </p><p>comments about the situation. A PC using this tactic doesn’t need to attempt a Diplomacy check to improve  his attitude, though they can still use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on him as normal.</p><p>Answers to PCs’ likely questions for Alak are below.</p><p><b>Who are you?</b></p><p> Alak offers a disarming, charming smile. “Armiger Alak Stagram of the Order of the Nail.  Formerly of Citadel Altaerein, currently of Citadel Vraid in Varisia.” He gives a formal bow. “How nice to meet you in this beautiful and well-kept estate.”</p><p><b>You’re a Hellknight? Why aren’t you wearing your official armor?</b> “No, not quite a Hellknight yet, and thus I’ve not yet earned the right to wear the armor. But I hope to some day. And I’m not here on official order business anyway—I’m merely, well... I suppose I’m on holiday, you see.”</p><p><b>Why are you here?</b> “I’ve taken a short leave of absence from the Order of the Nail to attend to some personal business.” If Alak’s attitude toward the PCs is at least friendly, he tells them the full truth: he’s here at the citadel looking for his family’s signet ring. His  late parents, who were also Hellknights of the Nail, never indicated the location of this treasured family heirloom, but Alak recently found out that it was stored “in a safe place” somewhere in Citadel Altaerein. He has checked the Hellknight test area, since his mother had previously administered the test during her later years and might have locked it away with other hidden valuables. He next plans to check the crypts below the  citadel, as respected order members sometimes kept  valuables or keepsakes in the vault. Alak is worried that looters might have absconded with the ring, but  trusts that his parents wouldn’t have left it where it could be easily found or stolen. If the PCs ask Alak to accompany them or vice  versa, and his attitude is at least friendly, he reveals that he hoped to check the crypts below for his ring,  but noticed that the main stairwell leading down to the crypt from the courtyard has collapsed. He knows  that there’s a hidden door somewhere in the Citadel  that acts as a secondary entrance to the crypt, but hasn’t managed to find it yet—he certainly welcomes the PCs’ aid in this search.</p><p><b>Why did those imps attack us? Did you summon them?</b> Alak raises an eyebrow and gives a devilish  smile, perhaps suppressing a laugh. “Goodness me, no, I didn’t summon those imps. They’re nothing but pests—pests from Hell, I’ll grant you, but verminous all the same. Simply no useful qualities at all. I suspect  they snuck into the citadel ages ago through some ritual or another, and simply avoided the Order of the Nail for years until they had the run of the place. Hell’s rancid children live forever, you know. I do appreciate your help putting them down.”</p><p><b>You’re not angry with us for trespassing in your order’s former home?</b> “Not at all. This place is a ruin,  a relic of the past. Most of its valuables were taken  to Varisia, after all, and what’s left behind—with some few exceptions—is of little value. Plus, you seem industrious. I like that,” Alak says. “Such a shame our old home has been so gutted—I’d have liked it if we could have kept a contingent here, just for tradition’s sake. But the Order of the Nail has queens to serve and law to uphold. As long as you’re not opposing those tenets, I’d say we’re fine.” He smirks and gives a low  chuckle. “Unless you’d like me to take you back to Vraid for judgment?”</p><p><b>Do you worship Asmodeus? Does that make you evil?</b> A bemused smirk flashes at the corner of  Alak’s mouth. “The Dark Prince does have a certain  reputation, I’ll grant,” he says. “And yet he has seen  more of existence than any immortal being, and the  absolute law he represents is unimpeachable. The  Hellknights understand this.” At this point, if any of the PCs begin to panic or accuse him of being wicked,  Alak chuckles calmly. “Look,” he says. “I’m the first to say devils are hateful things. I’m not about to have tea with any of their lot—I did put those imps down,  didn’t I? And no, I don’t worship Asmodeus. I don’t  have a lot of interest in matters of religion at all, to tell the truth.”</p><p><b>Do you know Citadel Altaerein? Can you help us with its layout?</b> “Alas, I cannot. I know only the few  rooms I’ve explored so far—I’ve never visited here, having grown up in Varisia, and I lacked the proper  clearance to reference my Order’s cartographic archives,” Alak says.</p><p><b>Are you here to reclaim the citadel?</b> </p><p>“Oh my no. My order has pretty much washed its hands of this place—most of them think of Isger as a backwater, in fact. It’s a shame seeing this place left to rot, though.  In fact, there’s a story that when my order left this  place, they hid the deed to the Citadel somewhere inside, and anyone brave enough and strong enough  to find it would be rewarded with ownership of the place.” </p><p><b>Do you know anything about the red smoke coming from bonfires on the battlements?</b> “I do not,” Alak  answers. “Except that this place is now crawling with monsters. Perhaps the fires are a sign of more of  those. Or perhaps they’re something else. I suppose I’ll find out soon enough.” If the PCs ask him to accompany them as they  explore the citadel, especially if they do so with an eye toward amusing him and aiding him in his search,  Alak agrees, since he’s not on a particular timeline  with his personal quest. Otherwise, the Hellknight armiger bids them farewell and sets off on his own. In this case, you can have the PCs encounter him later in the complex, or perhaps even come to their rescue  if they get in over their heads. If Alak accompanies  the group, don’t adjust the XP awards they gain.  However, he’s not very stealthy, so his presence  is more likely to cause enemies to find the group, possibly combining multiple smaller encounters into one more difficult fight.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b></p><p> If the PCs convince Alak to accompany  them, award them XP as if they had defeated him in combat.</p>","_id":"czoXXp0MYWZDf2aF"}

Upon closer inspection, the details of the various weapons and minor variations in the armor of the  figures distinguish these tombs. Two of the coffins loom  ominously open. The east wall bears a complex series of inscriptions composed of faintly glowing pale blue runes.</blockquote><p>This is the final resting place of several of the Order  of the Nail’s past lictors (leaders of the order). Six lictors were interred here; three of the name plates on  the sepulchers are so old and tarnished that they’re  unreadable, but the other three are still legible and bear the names Lictor Serafina DiViri, Lictor Rexinald Harvenskein, and Lictor Yorick Mellano.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b></p><p> As in area <b>B13</b>, undead guardians rose  here to defend the room’s contents, but Voz never encountered this particular horror—wights who were once the Lictors Serafina DiViri and Yorick Mellano.

As in area <b>B14</b>, the wights do not instigate  attacks on anyone who openly wears Hellknight regalia, but otherwise fight until destroyed.</p><blockquote><h4>Wights (2)</h4><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 332<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +10</blockquote><p><b>Treasure:</b></p><p> As the PCs might have discovered from the books in area <b>B8</b>, Order of the Nail tradition dictates that former leaders are interred with a magic weapon of the type they favored in life. As such, three of the Hellknights here were interred with <i>+1 halberds</i> (two of these once contained bodies that are now animated as wights—these coffins are open and empty save for their halberds), one is interred with a <i>+1 morningstar</i>,  one with a <i>+1 greatsword</i>, and one with a <i>+1 war flail</i>. The carvings on the tops of the coffins reflect which weapon is in which tomb. (You should consider  swapping out some of the non-halberd weapons to match those favored by PCs in your group.)</p><p>The weapons are inside the coffins, however, and the  PCs must open the other four lids to retrieve them.  Opening each coffin requires a successful DC 20 Thievery check to Pick a Lock, or a successful DC 22 Athletics check to Force Open the lid. (If he’s alongside them, again Alak Stagram winces, but understands the PCs’ need for a good arsenal to face their foes.)</p><p><b>Necromantic Ward:</b></p><p> The runes on the wall are a manifestation of the necromantic ward the Order of the  Nail placed long ago. These runes can be interpreted with Identify Magic (DC 23, or DC 21 if the PC already witnessed reanimated wights); on a success, a character understands that the ward caused several bodies in the crypt to animate as undead guardians in response to an attempt by someone else to use necromancy to despoil  the dead—a sort of necromantic “fight fire with fire” tactic. A successful DC 22 Society check confirms some  Hellknight orders used this practice in the early days but most have long since abandoned it. No indication of who or what triggered the ward can be discerned, but the number of active undead in the crypts is apparent (there may be as many as 12, subtracting any the PCs  have already defeated). Once all undead in the crypts  (found in areas <b>B13</b>–<b>B15</b>) are destroyed, this glowing set of runes vanishes. The ward can also be dismantled, but doing so is  difficult and unlikely to be something the PCs can currently accomplish. A successful <i>dispel magic</i> against the ward (which functions as a 4th-level spell) destroys it. Otherwise, Thievery can be used to disarm the ward via Disable a Device (DC 23). If a critical failure sets off the ward, the character attempting to disable the ward takes 3d6 negative damage.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b></p><p> If the PCs all wear Hellknight regalia  and avoid the wights’ attacks, award them XP as if they had defeated the wights in combat. If the PCs undo the necromantic ward, all  remaining undead in this wing are destroyed, their  spirits released back to the Boneyard. In this case,  award the PCs 120 XP, plus the full XP for each undead destroyed this way.</p>","_id":"d6mQHVD8lm1FxUQ3"}

Later sections detail how PCs can rescue  spectators, and how the councilors, guards, and fire mephit behave during the fire.</p><h4>Town Hall Fire - Hazard 1</h4><p><b>Endangered Spectators:</b></p><p> As soon as the fire begins,  the panicked spectators jump up and knock over  the benches in their hurry to escape, many of them  falling over themselves in the process. The entirety of both sections of benches is difficult terrain during  this encounter. Some of the spectators are able to pick themselves up and escape the chamber with help  from the councilors, but others are so terrified or  tangled among the benches and each other that they  need further assistance or they won’t escape the fire unharmed. There are 20 such spectators—10 on each side of the room, placed in random locations—whom the PCs must help, or they will pass out from smoke inhalation or worse. </p><p>Spectators avoid the flames but don’t exit the room  on their own—they need to be rescued by PCs. For simplicity, the hazard indicates when they typically fall unconscious or die.</p><p><b>Rescuing Spectators:</b></p><p> The PCs can each help two spectators at a time out of the room’s southern door. Once a PC is on the correct side of the room, rescuing spectators requires 3 actions, which includes locating  the spectators, calming them, and escorting them  to the exit. This doesn’t necessarily require moving adjacent to the spectators; a PC needs only to be on the same side of the room as the spectators. Multiple  PCs can work together to help groups of spectators who are clustered together. Two PCs working together can help up to six spectators at a time, as long as the PCs and the spectators they’re helping are all on the same side of the room. When spectators begin passing out, PCs can each instead help only one spectator at a time out of the room, since this now requires picking  up or dragging the unconscious spectator, and you  might need to track the PCs’ movement toward the unconscious spectators. Two PCs can work together to help four unconscious spectators at a time.</p><p><b>Town Councilors:</b></p><p> Unless the PCs instruct them  to do otherwise, the town councilors spend this encounter helping spectators escape the chamber. Each of the five councilors helps one spectator escape in the  second, third, fourth, and fifth rounds, for a total of four spectators per councilor and 20 all together (the  PCs must rescue the other 20). However, if the PCs  shout instructions at one or more of the councilors to do something, the councilors are eager to listen to the heroes and follow their instructions, although the PCs then must help any spectators who still need help  and would have been helped by the councilors. The  councilors can be instructed to do anything except fight the fire mephit.</p><p>Councilors can be instructed to retrieve buckets of  water from Fountain Circle, in which case this task requires the same number of actions as for a PC. The  councilors could instead be instructed to form the bucket brigade. Each councilor asked to help do this  reduces the number of rounds to set up the brigade by 1 (to a minimum of 0 rounds, starting the  brigade as soon as 15 spectators have been rescued). You can encourage using the councilors in creative ways. </p><p><b>Guards:</b></p><p> Unless the PCs shout out  what’s happening at the beginning  of this encounter, the guards who  were outside of the chamber’s  doors try to determine what  caused the fire and attempt to  catch the perpetrator. If the PCs alert the guards to the presence of the mephit, one guard answers  and confronts the creature at  the beginning of the next round. In this case, it takes the guard 3 rounds to defeat  the mephit—for simplicity’s sake, there is no need to run the mechanics of this combat.  At your discretion, the PCs might  instruct one guard or both guards to help escort spectators or douse the fire. If the PCs want to track down the guards at a later time, they must spend the full round tracking down the guard or guards.</p><p><b>Fire Mephit:</b></p><p> If no PCs confront the fire mephit in combat or are trying to douse the fire (and no guard confronts it), the creature spends its turns harnessing  its inner fiery nature to breathe fire. Each round the fire mephit moves to a random part of the room and then uses 2 actions to light a 5-foot-square area of the council chamber on fire. These fires spread at the same time as the larger fires and at the same rate.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> For each spectator saved, award the party 5 XP (to a maximum of 100 XP). If the party  douses the fire entirely, award them an additional 30 XP.</p>","_id":"ePgZdCp5DHpfKU7a"}

Selling that information would get me out from under  Voz’s thumb!” (A successful DC 15 Society check is enough for a PC to know that Voz is the name of the local bookseller in Breachill.)</p><p><b>But what if evildoers find out about Alseta’s Ring?</b> “Who cares?” Calmont laughs uproariously. “Long as I get paid—and get the hell out of Voz’s shop!”</p><p><b>Who is Voz?/How did you find out about Alseta’s Ring?</b> “You know, Voz—the bookseller?

A few errant milkweeds and tufts of crabgrass protrude from the  cracked cobblestone flooring. The ground to the west is sunken in, creating a natural pool of rainwater. To the north, the battlements above have partially collapsed into a huge mound of stone and wooden rubble, under which some sort of reptilian creature seems to have been crushed. The top half of a flight of wooden stairs rises up to the battlements  above the collapsed section of the walls; broken plants  from the bottom half lie amid the rubble below. A thick  rope has been affixed via a grappling hook to the lower portion of the stairs, dangling down to within a few feet of the top of the rubble pile.</blockquote><p>If the PCs enter the courtyard soon after hearing the ruckus while they were in area <b>A6</b>, also read them the following text.</p><blockquote>The desperate shouts and barking growls continue here, but now their sources are obvious. The shouts come from the battlements above, where a few goblins and a halfling man holding another goblin at knifepoint can be seen. The man seems to be threatening the goblins, while the goblins  look like they’re pleading for mercy. The source of the growling is of greater concern, though—for it comes from a large, draconic beast not far away at ground level, roaring at the delicious but inaccessible prey above!</blockquote><p>This is the central courtyard of Citadel Altaerein, once reserved for the Hellknights’ field drills and large- scale training exercises. The entire courtyard is sunk  into the earth a few feet, hence the short stairways leading up to the iron gate to the south. The iron gate that leads to area <b>A6</b> is locked, while the one that once opened to the north has collapsed under fallen rubble from the battlements above. This collapse also blocked  the primary entrance to the vaults below. With a  successful DC 13 Perception check, a PC notes that the collapse was quite recent. The rope dangling from the lower portion of  the stairs leading to the battlements can be used to  climb up to the stairs from the rubble pile; doing so  requires a successful DC 15 Athletics check to make the 10-foot climb. The rubble itself has settled and can be clambered over; it is difficult terrain. Digging the rubble out to expose the stairs that lead down to area <b>B1</b> is a downtime activity requiring days of work—in time, the PCs will be able to tackle this (see <i>Pathfinder  Adventure Path #146: Cult of Cinders</i>), but for now the way should remain impassable.</p><p><b>Creature:</b></p><p> The growling, dragon-like creature is an  export from the Mwangi Expanse, a creature known as a grauladon that the Cinderclaws brought with them  through Huntergate. (See the What Happened Here? sidebar for how the grauladon ended up trapped in the courtyard.) The goblins and halfling above are caught in a standoff, shouting in Goblin at each other. The halfling  is Calmont, and he’s taken one of the goblins hostage and is threatening to cut the goblin’s throat if the others  don’t throw down their weapons and help him find a  way into the dungeons below. The goblins stubbornly  refuse—between begging him to let their chief Helba  go, they foolishly hurl insults back at him without recognizing this is only making the standoff worse. Once the goblins above notice the PCs, they start shouting down to the PCs for help in a mix of Goblin and Common. Calmont retreats into the northeast tower  with his prisoner, Helba, to consider his options. See area <b>A22</b> for what happens next up on the battlements, but in the meantime, the grauladon shifts its attention from the scene above to the PCs themselves.</p><p>The wide-open habitat combined with the swampy terrain in the area’s west side has made this the perfect lair for the grauladon, a rather stupid and squat but  vicious predator that normally preys on inattentive  animals and people who happen to wander into its  domain. The grauladon is hungry and mean—it has  sustained itself so far by eating the remains of the other grauladon, which perished under the collapsing  battlement. If the grauladon is reduced below 8 Hit  Points, though, its bluster breaks and it retreats into the foul waters of the pool to the west, where it fights to the death if pursued. Although it can’t climb, the grauladon has been  tormenting the Bumblebrashers on the citadel’s battlements with its threatening growls on and off for  days. For that entire time, the goblins have worried that the beast might find a way up and munch on them  all. If the PCs defeat the grauladon, the goblins are extremely grateful; see area <b>A22</b> for more information. The grauladon is not normally encountered in temperate climates, and a PC who succeeds at a DC 16 Arcana check not only identifies the tropical draconic creature for what it is, but recognizes that it is way out  of its element. This hint foreshadows the portal that links Alseta’s Ring below to the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, but that explanation shouldn’t be apparent to the PCs quite yet.</p><blockquote><h4>Grauladon Crea Ture 2</h4>Page 88<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +7</blockquote><p><b>Hazard:</b></p><p> The pool to the west is filled with rancid water that is about 3 feet deep at its deepest point.

Once the grauladon notices the PCs and noisily attacks, though, the goblins and Calmont quickly take  note as well—the goblins begin calling for help from  above while Calmont starts threatening them once more, as described in the Creature section on page 22.</p><p>If the PCs storm into the courtyard and either defeat the grauladon and then retreat, or are forced to flee the grauladon, the standoff upstairs remains on hold until the PCs reach the battlements, as detailed in area <b>A22</b>.</p>","_id":"k33di4QNiEb8lKLs"}

And when Malarunk unleash Dahak—glorious, glorious Dahak!  You cannot stop Cinderclaws!” The boggards’ mention of the portal is a reference to Huntergate in  the caverns below (see Chapter 4), which Malarunk  hopes to restore to full functionality so that more cultists can pour into Isger.

During those years, the vain  and evil creature soaked up the goblinoids’ fear as  well as their tribute. Fealty made Ralldar cruel, and when the local goblinoid tribes failed to bring him the  increasingly outlandish gifts he desired, he casually murdered them and lashed their corpses to his throne as a warning to all others. The worship they gave him  also made Ralldar complacent and comfortable, so  that rather than venture to the Abyss upon feeding  enough to become a greater barghest, he instead remained in this world to wallow in goblin adoration.  But then, when heroes swept in and slaughtered his  goblins, Ralldar hid in his treasure room (area <b>D4</b>) like a coward, only emerging days later to discover his tribe gone forever. Since then, Ralldar has had a break with reality. He gathered up the bodies of the slaughtered goblins, arranged them around his throne in properly worshipful  positions, and for the decades ever after has ruled a silent collection of perfectly compliant adoring minions.  Ralldar knows the goblins are dead, but also believes  they’re still “here” and able to adore him. With very few visitors to his realm and with his immortal nature  preserving him from starvation, Ralldar has wiled away the decades as a self-styled goblin god. Today, Ralldar mostly just sits on his throne and  torments his long-dead goblin minions, demanding  gifts and bizarre shows of fealty (which the goblins </p><p>corpses, of course, cannot provide) until he flies into a fit of rage and scatters their bones. These periods are followed by days or weeks of calm, during  which Ralldar rebuilds the skeletons and poses them anew. He’s just finishing up such  a period of redecoration when the PCs arrive, and he moves about the room in the form of an industrious but filthy goblin. As soon as Ralldar notices the PCs, he  scrambles up onto his throne and then  shouts: “Mongrel cave-things! You dare  enter Ralldar’s kingdom? Bestow upon your god proper tribute, or be consumed by misery and death!” If the PCs attempt to talk to Ralldar, he  begins by demanding the most expensive magic item that he can see on any of the PCs as tribute. If the PCs give it to him, Ralldar then demands  “the skull of a spider mounted on the skeleton of a man” as his next gift. If the PCs do anything other than flee immediately  to retrieve this outlandish gift or succeed at a DC 27 Deception check to fool him into thinking they’re loyal subjects, Ralldar flies into a rage. He leaps down from his throne and assumes his true form to attack, but if reduced to fewer than 25 Hit Points, he assumes goblin form and flees to his treasure room (area <b>D4</b>). If confronted there, he reverts to his true form and fights to the death.</p><blockquote><h4>Ralldar Crea Ture 7</h4>Male greater barghest (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 36)<br><b>Initiative</b> Perception +16<br><b>Mutation</b> fangs</blockquote>","_id":"qJ3P4q1fgmvaCbBN"}

Since she  first discovered this path to Citadel  Altaerein a few days ago, she’s been  making periodic forays into the length of caverns between here and Citadel Altaerein, but progress has been slow, as she’s had to deal with several pockets of vermin and other cave denizens along the way.

Voz stays out of melee for as long as possible, hitting the PCs with area-of-effect spells and staying as mobile  as she can to avoid taking damage from the heroes’ ranged attacks and spells.

The correspondence doesn’t make it clear exactly what sort of organization the Scarlet Triad is, but the  group promises to sponsor Voz’s plans to found an assassination guild and necromancy laboratory in the basement of Citadel Altaerein. Before they’ll initiate  this patronage and proved her support, though, the  Scarlet Triad correspondent tells Voz that she must  first confirm the existence of Alseta’s Ring, find a  way to secure it, and then activate as many of the portals as possible. Once she proves to this shadowy  group that she’s done this, the Scarlet Triad has promised hefty compensation, more than enough for her to get started setting up her guild and laboratory under Hellknight Hill. Voz signs all of her letters “By Norgorber’s hand,” a phrase that a DC 15 Religion  check reveals marks her as a dedicated follower of the Reaper of Reputation.</p><p>A PC who succeeds at a DC 20 Society check to Recall  Knowledge knows that the Scarlet Triad is a minor  merchant’s guild based in Katapesh, far to the south. Voz has been careful to avoid writing much about them  in her journal, but she might be motivated to reveal  more about them if she’s captured alive and the PCs successfully interrogate her, as detailed in her write-up  on page 80. One key clue is the name “Laslunn,” the  name of Voz’s mysterious Scarlet Triad correspondent  (the PCs will learn that Laslunn is one of the Scarlet  Triad’s commanders in the third adventure—for now, her name should remain a mystery). The Scarlet Triad is, of course, much more than a mere merchant’s guild, but it has taken great pains to hide its true nature and power—finding out more about it is one of the ongoing themes of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path. For now,  the name of the guild should be little more than a tantalizing mystery to the PCs. If the PCs examine Voz’s journal, they find the  pages within are written in Necril. Once translated,  the journal’s contents are mostly about Voz’s plans  for an assassin’s guild and necromancer’s school, but several pages near the back contain her research  and notes about Alseta’s Ring. The bulk of the  information comes from old reports from the time  of the Goblinblood Wars, when a group of soldiers confronted a clan of goblins who’d taken up residence  in a series of caves near Breachill. These reports indicated that at the deepest portion of the caves, an entrance into a much older ruin that the goblins feared  to enter was discovered. The soldiers explored a bit  further, discovered a “ring of strange archways,” but  were ultimately driven away by powerful animated statues that “emerged from nearby doors” to attack. Voz’s additional research, which includes copious  notes on the necromantic ritual she performed recently to interrogate the spirits of the dead in the  crypt below Citadel Altaerein, seem to confirm her theories that this ring of portals is an ancient elven ruin called Alseta’s Ring. Her research suggests that  Alseta’s Ring was among the first of the <i>aiudara</i>—ancient portals created by the elves before Earthfall—and that the six portals that made up the ring linked  six different sites. One of these she has confirmed  as having once linked to Kyonin, but this section  of Alseta’s ring has fallen into ruin and now leads to the goblin caves (providing a back door into the dungeons below Citadel Altaerein), but observations  from soldiers in the Goblinblood Wars suggested  the other five portals still stood at that time. Voz’s  research indicates that for a portal to be activated,  a key item has to be used. Where the remaining  five portals might lead and what keys are required to activate them, alas, Voz has not yet been able to  determine, but in her notes she is optimistic that, once she secures the site and has the chance to study the portals in person, clues as to their function will present themselves.</p><p>The final few pages of the journal cover Voz’s last  several days spent exploring the caverns between here and the deeper Goblinblood Caves she suspects links to Alseta’s Ring itself. Her notes on the giant spiders and centipedes and other vermin slain, along  with notes on her own undead minions expended, make it clear that much of the journey through the caves should be safe until the PCs are quite close to Alseta’s Ring.

Many of the  goblinoid hordes were overwhelming in number but  lacked any structure or leadership, but some smaller groups benefitted from the brilliant charge of shrewd  hobgoblin commanders. During the height of the  wars, the clearing that became known as Guardian’s Way was one major place where goblinoids emerged  to muster their numbers and attack the settlements beyond, including Breachill. Located about 6 miles northwest of town,  Guardian’s Way was once a heavily fortified outpost built to try to stem the tide of goblinoids before they  could rampage into more populated areas beyond.  Companies of elite human soldiers lived and fought  here, and their bravery saved many lives during the  4 years of conflict. However, 18 years ago, the wars  ended and there was no longer a military need for soldiers to live here in isolation, and so Isger’s military abandoned the station. The military left the complex’s four structures intact, though, and over the years, the  out-of-the-way station became a haven for bandits, monsters, and other troublemakers in the wilderness. Very recently, the station became the home to a mercenary band called the Bloody Blades, led by one Dmiri Yoltosha, a wily hobgoblin commander. Dmiri  didn’t serve in the Goblinblood Wars, but she grew  up hearing the grand and vicious stories of family members who did, and so she carries a burning hatred  for the humans of Isger who she believes unfairly robbed her kin of victory. When Voz Lirayne arrived in the area to explore  the nearby caverns in hopes of finding Alseta’s  Ring underneath Citadel Altaerein, she found the  mercenaries camping here and hired them to occupy  the station and make sure no one followed her into the caves.</p>","_id":"qdJ8bC9j6pV0cHyl"}

When the PCs enter the town hall, guards positioned at the front doors direct them to the council chamber, the entrance of which is just past the main hallway. Just before the meeting begins, the guards move to stand outside the chamber’s southern door. Once inside the council chamber (see the map  above), the PCs see that the room is set up as an  auditorium, with a carpeted walkway separating several rows of benches into two sections. The carpet leads to a small set of steps and a raised dais. On the  dais is a large desk separated into five parts, where the Breachill Town Council’s five members are seated, talking quietly with one another as they wait for the meeting to start. On the desk, situated in front of each chair, are tarnished bronze plaques bearing the names of the council members. From east to west, the names  are Jorsk Hinterclaw, Melma Ann Sendari, Greta  Gardania, Trini Sprizzlegig, and Quentino Posandi.  Melma, Greta, and Quentino are humans, Jorsk is a dwarf, and Trini is a gnome. Even if the PCs don’t read  the plaques, a successful DC 10 Society check easily  reveals this information, as does asking any member  of the crowd assembled for the meeting. Further, a  successful check or chatting with the crowd reveals  that Greta Gardania, who is seated at the desk’s  middle spot, is the council president and is expected to open the meeting.</p><p>In all, there are 40 townspeople in addition to the  PCs and the councilors assembled for the meeting.  (These are the same townspeople who were outside the building waiting for it to begin, so the PCs might  recognize people they spoke with, or they might choose to sit with any newfound friends.) Read or paraphrase the following to get this scene underway.</p><blockquote>With a sharp rap from her gavel onto the desk, a stern, dark-haired woman with a deeply furrowed forehead and kind eyes brings the assembled crowd to a hush. “Welcome, neighbors and friends...” the dark-haired  woman begins, her rich voice washing over the room, “... to the Breachill Town Council’s monthly Call for Heroes.  I am Council President Greta Gardania, at your service.  On behalf of my colleagues beside me, I promise you all  that we will hear and consider today’s petition with the utmost discretion and care. There is no existence without community, as our town charter says. “Today, our agenda includes one petition. Miss Warbal, our very own ambassador to the Bumblebrashers of Hellknight Hill, requests the help of heroes for a matter of utmost importance. Let’s hear her concerns in her own words, shall we? Miss Warbal?”</blockquote><p>At this summons, Warbal emerges from the front  row of benches. The well-dressed goblin woman makes her way to the foot of the dais’s steps. She clears her throat and begins her address to the council.</p><blockquote>“Esteemed councilors,” Warbal says, with a frazzled tone to her voice. “It has been more than a month since I’ve  been able to contact the Bumblebrashers. I fear that something terrible has befallen them. What’s more, I have seen my people’s distress signal coming from the top of Citadel Altaerein—”</blockquote><p>Before the goblin can continue her petition, the door on the western side of the room flies open, as a young  man, his eyes wide with panic, runs in shouting and waving his ink-stained hands. Billowing black smoke and flames follow him into the room: “Fire! There’s a fire! Everyone flee!”</p>","_id":"uSIthvFVRcYvqo5D"}

If the  PCs don’t approach the goblins on the battlements,  eventually Helba, who had been Calmont’s hostage, approaches them. Read or paraphrase the following.</p><blockquote>As the dust from the drama on the battlements settles, you hear a distinctive, garbled throat-clearing coming from  nearby. Soon, the short, slight goblin woman who’d been  held hostage by Calmont approaches. “Excuse me,” she says, in a voice like that of a hoarse bird. “Excuse me, and thank you, friends. You are friends? You must be friends, because you’ve just saved the Bumblebrashers from that man. So much flailing! And shrieking! Ack! “I am Helba, and I am the Bumblebrashers’ chieftain.  We have been stuck up here for so long—days it feels like! Maybe even weeks? Hard to keep track. First those awful monsters chased us from our comfy basement, then  that dragon-dog came, and then that awful halfling man  showed up talking about elves and other nonsense! No elves live here! Just us Bumblebrashers!”Helba looks back at her people, and a deeply morose look settles upon her face. “I just want to protect my people. But everything—everyone—wants us dead.”</blockquote><p>If the PCs don’t engage further with Helba or the Bumblebrashers, she hesitatingly trundles up to one of them, tugs on their sleeve, and asks them both to help  the Bumblebrashers reclaim their home in Altaerein’s  vaults (areas <b>B6</b>–<b>B11</b>), and to deal with the cultists terrorizing the dungeons. Most importantly, she tells the PCs about the secret door in the hillside just west of the Citadel that provides access to the vaults below.</p><p>The PCs may wish to spend some time talking with  Helba, who is desperate but also deeply cares about her people. Answers to likely questions are below.</p><p><b>What drove you from your home in the vaults?</b>Helba gets a panicked look at her face, but then she  glances back to her tribe mates and conspicuously rights her posture. “Cultists—at least I think they’re  cultists. They called themselves the Cinderclaws,  and they said our home was their home now. They threatened to roast us! To peel us and eat us! Ack! And they had dragon monsters with them! So of course we  ran from the vaults. Then so many monsters on the  ground floor, so we ran up here, to the battlements.  That dragon thing down in the courtyard kept us  from getting away! It wanted to eat us!” If the PCs  have already killed the grauladon, Helba thanks  them profusely for this additional service the PCs have provided.</p><p><b>How can we get down to the vaults?</b> Helba looks at the PCs gratefully and then nods. “Yes, of course, we’ll tell you. You’re friends. There’s a secret door just down the hill to the west. It’s not hard to find when  you look, but I can show it to you! It goes right to  the vaults, where we used to live; we used the door all the time to go out and hunt for food.” As long as Helba tells the PCs this, they do not need to succeed at a Perception check to find the secret door that leads to area <b>B1</b>.</p><p><b>What do you know about Alseta’s Ring?</b> Helba looks honestly confused. “Never heard of an Alseta ring. Is it shiny? I bet it is. Rings are always shiny.  But there were no shiny rings in our vaults, I can say. But there’s rooms even deeper, and crypts too. We never go there, but maybe the ring is hidden in there?”</p><p><b>That awful man was threatening you! Why didn’t you just tell him how to get downstairs?</b> “We would have! Was going to! What do we care if he runs downstairs to get slashed by cultists? But he grabbed me too fast and started screaming, and waving that knife, and we couldn’t get a word in edgewise. We froze! I froze! He’s awful! Don’t let him near us again!”</p><p><b>Can we deliver a message to Warbal?</b></p><p> “Warbal, yes! Cousin Warbal! My good friend. Good cousin! Such a smart lady; now she lives in the big city. Please, new friends, if you could tell her that we’re alive—and that you’ve saved us!—the Bumblebrashers would be most  grateful. We’ve still lost our home down below, but  maybe not forever—right?” Helba looks at the PCs hopefully at this last comment. Once the grauladon is defeated and Calmont is taken care of, the Bumblebrashers consider the threat to their lives ended and stop sending distress signals  via the fires on the citadel’s battlements. If the PCs  ask Helba about the dangers they might face in  the underground levels, see the Goblin Intelligence sidebar on page 33. The goblins quickly make their way out of the citadel and hunker down in the nearby hills, waiting patiently for word that the cultists have been cleared out of the dungeons before they brave  a return to the citadel. Of course, in the end, the Bumblebrashers’ fate is left to the PCs to decide.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b></p><p> For rescuing the Bumblebrashers, award the party 120 XP. (Note that over time, other Bumblebrashers who still dwell in secret clearings and hidden caves in the nearby wilds might come forward to augment the few survivors of those who dwelt below  Citadel Altaerein, especially if the PCs encourage such growth in the future as part of their role in the adventures to come as caretakers of the citadel.)</p>","_id":"uzuIKze2yGNk4k5A"}

In all, about  40 townspeople are congregated outside the building, chatting and passing the time until the meeting starts.  When you start this adventure, it’s a good idea to share the map of Breachill (found on the inside cover of this book and in the <i>Age of Ashes Player’s Guide</i>)  with the PCs. When you do, point out where the PCs are coming from, as well as Fountain Circle and  Breachill Town Hall, their destination. This should help the players visualize the surroundings, but it also  serves as a discreet way to emphasize the placement of the well pumps just outside the town hall. It’s likely that the PCs won’t think much of the pumps’ presence  now, but knowing about them will come in handy during the fire to come. If the PCs spend any time talking with these townspeople, they find the locals friendly and deeply curious about them as adventurers, no matter the PCs’ backgrounds or motivations. Some locals have brought their children with them to meet any new heroes, and the youngsters are starstruck to meet adventurers who plan to step up to the challenges that might be at hand. Most of the townspeople are attending the meeting to keep up on the news of what troubles their neighbors, though some are specifically there out of curiosity to see which adventurers might step up. You can use the locals’ questions about the PCs to give each player a  chance to describe their character’s appearance and goals, if you wish.</p><p>While the PCs are awaiting the meeting’s start, they notice a well-dressed goblin woman pacing right outside the front doors of the building. This studious-looking goblin has her hands clasped behind her back, and she’s mumbling to herself, oblivious to all those who stand nearby. Any PC who stands within 15 feet of her can easily overhear what she’s saying. “My Bumblebrashers,” she laments in a distraught tone.  “Why haven’t I heard from my Bumblebrashers? Are my people trapped in the citadel?” A successful DC 12 Society  check reveals that the  Bumblebrashers are a small local goblin tribe that lives in Citadel  Altaerein, the abandoned Hellknight  keep to the northeast. Simply asking the woman what she’s worried about also reveals this information. If the PCs talk to her,  she apologizes for her distracted nature  and assumes a dignified demeanor for  any conversation that might ensue.  Below are answers to some questions the PCs might ask her.<b>Who are you? What is your name?</b> “Please, do allow me to introduce myself. I am Warbal, ambassador to the Bumblebrasher goblins of Hellknight Hill. It is my great honor to serve  my fellow citizens of Breachill as the town’s official  representative to the Bumblebrashers. I communicate  with the Bumblebrashers, convey the town’s concerns  and interests to them, and advocate on the tribe’s  behalf. It is a duty I take very seriously—they are my people, after all. Hence why I am here today, and my rather distracted nature earlier. I hope you’ll forgive it.”</p><p><b>Who are the Bumblebrashers, and why are you worried about them?</b> “The Bumblebrashers are a tribe of goblins who have, for years now, lived peacefully and in isolation in Citadel Altaerein, the former Hellknight keep on the hill just outside of town. Typically, every  two weeks I meet with Helba, the tribe’s chieftain, on the road outside the keep. We discuss news, and I convey the town’s interests and hear any concerns that the tribe might wish me to bring before the council. It  is a relationship of utmost importance, and Helba is  normally punctual. But she has missed our previous two meetings, and I have seen plumes of smoke coming  from the top of the citadel. The smoke is a chalky  red in color—the tribe’s traditional color of distress. I fear that the Bumblebrashers are in danger, or that something dire has befallen them. It has sickened me with worry.”</p><p><b>Why do you plan to attend the council meeting?</b>“I am certain something foul has befallen the Bumblebrashers—their leader, Helba, would not miss our meeting twice in a row for no reason, nor would the tribe signal its distress if something terrible were  not amiss. I plan to present this information to the  council and ask them to hire adventurers to contact my tribe.”</p><p><b>Is there anything we can do to help?</b> “You are  adventurers! Are you not? You are just the heroes I hope the council might hire on my behalf. But please, there is a system in place for a reason. Come with me into the meeting and listen to my petition. If you are up for my task, I beg you to offer your services to the council. You might be my tribe’s only hope!”</p>","_id":"yltGAqTBU1Ml7lvr"}
