# Introduce Me
A Foundry VTT module that lets you introduce NPCs or other actors to all players with some flair.

The fanfare will display the actor's name, and optionally a short flavor text that you can add to actors.
After the display, the actor will be set to display their name whenever someone hovers their token, since they have now been introduced!

# Useage
Actors can be introduced either via a button placed on the Token's HUD menu, accessed via rightclicking it, or by using the macros included in the Introduce Me compendium. There is a module setting for disabling the HUD menu button if you're using the macros and don't want it taking space.

Flavor texts look best if they're not exessively long. The 'Private Preview' function can be used to check how it will look with the players none the wiser.

# Further Development
Feel free to draft a github issue tagged [FeatureSuggestion] or something like it if you've any ideas for further features.
